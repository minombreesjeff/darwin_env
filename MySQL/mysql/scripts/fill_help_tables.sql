To specify the password\nas the hashed value as returned by the PASSWORD() function, include\nthe keyword PASSWORD.\nSee also : [GRANT,  , GRANT].\n\nThe CREATE USER statement was added in MySQL 5.0.2.\n\n\n  @subsubsection DROP USER Syntax\n\n\n\nDROP USER user [, user] ...\n\nThe DROP USER statement deletes one or more MySQL accounts.\nTo use it, you\nmust have the global CREATE USER privilege or the DELETE\nprivilege for the mysql database.\nEach account is named using the same format as for GRANT\nor REVOKE; for example, 'jeffrey'@@'localhost'.  The user and\nhost parts of the account name correspond to the User and Host\ncolumn values of the user table record for the account.\n\nDROP USER was added in MySQL 4.1.1 and originally removed only\naccounts that have no privileges.  In MySQL 5.0.2, it was modified to also\nremove account privileges.  This means that the procedure for removing an\naccount depends on your version of MySQL.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.0.2, remove an account and its privileges as follows:\n\nDROP USER user;\n\nThe statement removes privilege records for the account from all grant tables.\n\nFrom MySQL 4.1.1 to 5.0.1, DROP USER deletes only MySQL accounts that\ndon't have any privileges. In these MySQL versions, it serves only to remove\neach account record from the user table. To remove a MySQL account, you\nshould use the following procedure, performing the steps in the order shown:\n\n@enumerate\n --- Use SHOW GRANTS to determine what privileges the account has.\nSee also : [SHOW GRANTS,  , SHOW GRANTS].\n --- Use REVOKE to revoke the privileges displayed by SHOW GRANTS.\nThis removes records for the account from all the grant tables except the\nuser table, and revokes any global privileges listed in the user\ntable.\nSee also : [GRANT,  , GRANT].\n --- Delete the account by using DROP USER to remove the user table\nrecord.\n@end enumerate\n\nDROP USER does not automatically close any open user sessions. Rather, in\nthe event that a user with an open session is dropped, the command does not take\neffect until that user's session is closed. Once the session is closed, the user\nis dropped, and that user's next attempt to log in will fail. This is by design.\n\nBefore MySQL 4.1.1, DROP USER is not available.  You should first\nrevoke the account privileges as just described. Then delete the user\ntable record and flush the grant tables like this:\n\nmysql> DELETE FROM mysql.user\n    -> WHERE User='user_name' and Host='host_name';\nmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n  @subsubsection GRANT and REVOKE Syntax\n\n\n\n\nGRANT priv_type [(column_list)] [, priv_type [(column_list)]] ...\n    ON [object_type] {tbl_name | * | *.* | db_name.*}\n    TO user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']\n        [, user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']] ...\n    [REQUIRE\n        NONE |\n        [{SSL| X509}]\n        [CIPHER 'cipher' [AND]]\n        [ISSUER 'issuer' [AND]]\n        [SUBJECT 'subject']]\n    [WITH with_option [with_option] ...]\n\nobject_type =\n    TABLE\n  | FUNCTION\n  | PROCEDURE\n\nwith_option =\n    GRANT OPTION\n  | MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR count\n  | MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR count\n  | MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR count\n  | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS count\n\nREVOKE priv_type [(column_list)] [, priv_type [(column_list)]] ...\n    ON [object_type] {tbl_name | * | *.* | db_name.*}\n    FROM user [, user] ...\n\nREVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM user [, user] ...\n\n\nThe GRANT and REVOKE statements allow system administrators to\ncreate MySQL user accounts and to grant rights to and revoke them from\naccounts.  GRANT and REVOKE are implemented in MySQL 3.22.11\nor later. For earlier MySQL versions, these statements do nothing.\n\nMySQL account information is stored in the tables of the mysql\ndatabase. This database and the access control system are discussed\nextensively in [MySQL Database Administration], which you should consult\nfor additional details.\n\nIf the grant tables contain privilege records that contain mixed-case\ndatabase or table names and the lower_case_table_names system\nvariable is set, REVOKE cannot be used to revoke the privileges. It\nwill be necessary to manipulate the grant tables directly. (GRANT\nwill not create such records when lower_case_table_names is set,\nbut such records might have been created prior to setting the variable.)\n\nPrivileges can be granted at several levels:\n\n   Global level\nGlobal privileges apply to all databases on a given server. These privileges\nare stored in the mysql.user table.\nGRANT ALL ON *.* and\nREVOKE ALL ON *.* grant and revoke only global privileges.\n\n   Database level\nDatabase privileges apply to all objects in a given database. These privileges\nare stored in the mysql.db and mysql.host tables.\nGRANT ALL ON db_name.* and\nREVOKE ALL ON db_name.* grant and revoke only database privileges.\n\n   Table level\nTable privileges apply to all columns in a given table. These privileges are\nstored in the mysql.tables_priv table.\nGRANT ALL ON db_name.tbl_name and\nREVOKE ALL ON db_name.tbl_name grant and revoke only table privileges.\n\n   Column level\nColumn privileges apply to single columns in a given table. These privileges are\nstored in the mysql.columns_priv table.\nWhen using REVOKE, you must specify the same columns that were granted.\n\n   Routine level\nThe CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE, and\nGRANT privileges apply to stored routines. They can be granted at the\nglobal and database levels. Also, except for CREATE ROUTINE, these\nprivileges can be granted at the routine level for individual routines and\nare stored in the mysql.procs_priv table.\n\n  \n\nThe object_type clause was added in MySQL 5.0.6.  It should be\nspecified as TABLE, FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE when the\nfollowing object is a table, a stored function, or a stored procedure.  To\nuse this clause when upgrading from a version of MySQL older than 5.0.6, you\nmust upgrade your grant tables.\nSee also : [Upgrading-grant-tables].\n","CREATE USER user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']\n    [, user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']] ..."),(56,2,"POINT","   Point(x,y)\nConstructs a WKB Point using its coordinates.\n",""),(57,25,"CURRENT_USER","   CURRENT_USER()\nReturns the username and hostname combination that the current session was\nauthenticated as.

They are saved to the *master.info file, but are ignored\nuntil you use a server that has SSL support enabled.\n\nIf you don't specify a given parameter, it keeps its old\nvalue, except as indicated in the following discussion. For example, if the password to connect to your MySQL master has\nchanged, you just need to issue these statements\nto tell the slave about the new password:\n\nmysql> STOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='new3cret';\nmysql> START SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication\n\nThere is no need to specify the parameters that do\nnot change (host, port, user, and so forth).\n\nMASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the hostname (or IP address) of\nthe master host and its TCP/IP port. Note that if MASTER_HOST is\nequal to localhost, then, like in other parts of MySQL, the port\nmay be ignored (if Unix socket files can be used, for example).\n\nIf you specify MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT,\nthe slave assumes that the master server is different than\nbefore (even if you specify a host or port value that is\nthe same as the current value.) In this case, the old values for the master\nbinary log name and position are considered no longer applicable, so if you\ndo not specify MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the\nstatement, MASTER_LOG_FILE='' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are\nsilently appended to it.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates\nat which the slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the\nnext time the thread starts.\nIf you specify either of them, you can't specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS are\nspecified, the slave uses the last coordinates of the /slave SQL thread/\nbefore CHANGE MASTER was issued. This ensures that\nreplication has no discontinuity, even if the slave SQL thread was late\ncompared to the slave I/O thread, when you just want to change, say, the\npassword to use. This safe behavior was introduced starting from MySQL\n4.0.17 and 4.1.1. (Before these versions, the coordinates used were\nthe last coordinates of the slave I/O thread before CHANGE MASTER\nwas issued. This caused the SQL thread to possibly lose some events\nfrom the master, thus breaking replication.)\n\nCHANGE MASTER /deletes all relay log files/ and starts\na new one, unless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay logs are kept;\nas of MySQL 4.1.1 the relay_log_purge global variable\nis set silently to 0.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO updates the contents of the *master.info and\n*relay-log.info files.\n\nCHANGE MASTER is useful for setting up a slave when you have\nthe snapshot of the master and have recorded the log and the offset\ncorresponding to it.  After loading the snapshot into the slave, you\ncan run CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',\nMASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master on the slave.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',\n    ->     MASTER_USER='replication',\n    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',\n    ->     MASTER_PORT=3306,\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n    ->     MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n",""),(149,28,"DROP DATABASE","DROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

You can specify the --compress option to get better\nperformance over slow networks if the client and server support the\ncompressed protocol.\nSee also : [mysqlimport,  , mysqlimport].\n\nIf you specify the LOW_PRIORITY keyword, execution of the\nLOAD DATA statement is delayed until no other clients are reading\nfrom the table.\n\nIf you specify the CONCURRENT keyword with a MyISAM table that\nsatisfies the condition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free\nblocks in the middle),\nthen other threads can retrieve data from the table while LOAD DATA\nis executing. Using this option affects the performance of LOAD DATA\na bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same time.\n\nIf the LOCAL keyword is specified, it is\ninterpreted with respect to the client end of the connection:\n\n\n --- If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\nclient host and sent to the server.

If given as a relative pathname, the name is\ninterpreted relative to the directory in which the client program was started.\n\n --- If LOCAL is not specified, the\nfile must be located on the server host and is read directly by the server.\n\n\nLOCAL is available in MySQL 3.22.6 or later.\n\nWhen locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:\n\n --- If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.\n\n --- If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,\nthe server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.\n\n --- If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for\nthe file in the database directory of the default database.\n\nNote that these rules mean that a file named as *./myfile.txt is read from\nthe server's data directory, whereas the same file named as *myfile.txt is\nread from the database directory of the default database.

The select_statement is a\nSELECT statement that provides the definition of the view.\nThe statement can select from base tables or other views.\n\nThis statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the view, and\nsome privilege for each column selected by the SELECT statement.\nFor columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must have\nthe SELECT privilege.  If the OR REPLACE clause is present,\nyou must also have the DELETE privilege for the view.\n\nA view belongs to a database.  By default, a new view is created in the\ncurrent database.  To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it.\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nTables and views share the same namespace within a database, so a database\ncannot contain a table and a view that have the same name.\n\nViews must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base\ntables.  By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement are used for the view column names.  To define explicit names for\nthe view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as a\nlist of comma-separated identifiers.  The number of names in\ncolumn_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns. They can also be expressions that use functions, constant\nvalues, operators, and so forth.\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are\ninterpreted with respect to the default database.  A view can refer to\ntables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view name with\nthe proper database name.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements.  It can\nrefer to base tables or other views.  It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries.  The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The\nfollowing example defines a view that selects two columns from another\ntable, as well as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n\n --- The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM\nclause.\n\n --- The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.\n\n --- The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\n --- Within a stored routine, the definition cannot refer to routine\nparameters or local variables.\n\n --- Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist.  However, after\na view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view that the\ndefinition refers to.  To check a view definition for problems of this kind,\nuse the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\n --- The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\ncreate a TEMPORARY view.\n\n --- The tables named in the view definition must already exist.\n\n --- You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\n\nORDER BY is allowed in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the effect\nis undefined.  For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies.  This same\nprinciple applies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or\nSQL_SMALL_RESULT that follow the SELECT keyword, and to\nclauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE, LOCK IN SHARE MODE,\nand PROCEDURE.\n\nIf you create a view and then change the query processing environment by\nchanging system variables, that may affect the results you get from the\nview:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT CHARSET(CHAR(65)), COLLATION(CHAR(65));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SET NAMES 'latin1';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| CHARSET(CHAR(65)) | COLLATION(CHAR(65)) |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| latin1            | latin1_swedish_ci   |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SET NAMES 'utf8';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| CHARSET(CHAR(65)) | COLLATION(CHAR(65)) |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n| utf8              | utf8_general_ci     |\n+-------------------+---------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL.\nALGORITHM takes three values: MERGE, TEMPTABLE, or\nUNDEFINED. The default algorithm is UNDEFINED if no\nALGORITHM clause is present.  The algorithm affects how MySQL\nprocesses the view.\n\nFor MERGE, the text of a statement that refers to the view and the view\ndefinition are merged such that parts of the view definition replace\ncorresponding parts of the statement.\n\nFor TEMPTABLE, the results from the view are retrieved into a\ntemporary table, which then is used to execute the statement.\n\nFor UNDEFINED, MySQL chooses which algorithm to use.  It prefers\nMERGE over TEMPTABLE if possible, because MERGE is\nusually more efficient and because a view cannot be updatable if a temporary\ntable is used.\n\nA reason to choose TEMPTABLE explicitly is that locks can be released\non underlying tables after the temporary table has been created and before\nit is used to finish processing the statement.  This might result in quicker\nlock release than the MERGE algorithm so that other clients that use\nthe view are not blocked as long.\n\nA view algorithm can be UNDEFINED three ways:\n\n\n --- No ALGORITHM clause is present in the CREATE VIEW statement.\n\n --- The CREATE VIEW statement has an explicit ALGORITHM = UNDEFINED\nclause.\n\n --- ALGORITHM = MERGE is specified for a view that can be processed only\nwith a temporary table.  In this case, MySQL generates a warning and sets\nthe algorithm to UNDEFINED.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, MERGE is handled by merging corresponding parts\nof a view definition into the statement that refers to the view.  The\nfollowing examples briefly illustrate how the MERGE algorithm works.\nThe examples assume that there is a view v_merge that has this\ndefinition:\n\nCREATE ALGORITHM = MERGE VIEW v_merge (vc1, vc2) AS\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;\n\nExample 1: Suppose that we issue this statement:\n\nSELECT * FROM v_merge;\n\nMySQL handles the statement as follows:\n\n\n --- v_merge becomes t\n\n --- * becomes vc1, vc2, which corresponds to c1, c2\n\n --- The view WHERE clause is added\n\n\nThe resulting statement to be executed becomes:\n\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE c3 > 100;\n\nExample 2: Suppose that we issue this statement:\n\nSELECT * FROM v_merge WHERE vc1 < 100;\n\nThis statement is handled similarly to the previous one, except that\nvc1 < 100 becomes c1 < 100 and the view WHERE clause is\nadded to the statement WHERE clause using an AND connective\n(and parentheses are added to make sure the parts of the clause are executed\nwith correct precedence).  The resulting statement to be executed becomes:\n\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM t WHERE (c3 > 100) AND (c1 < 100);\n\nEffectively, the statement to be executed has a WHERE clause of this\nform:\n\nWHERE (select WHERE) AND (view WHERE)\n\nThe MERGE algorithm requires a one-to relationship between the rows\nin the view and the rows in the underlying table. If this relationship does\nnot hold, a temporary table must be used instead.  Lack of a one-to-one\nrelationship occurs if the view contains any of a number of constructs:\n\n\n --- Aggregate functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(),\nCOUNT(), and so forth)\n\n --- DISTINCT\n\n --- GROUP BY\n\n --- HAVING\n\n --- UNION or UNION ALL\n\n --- Refers only to literal values (in this case, there is no underlying table)\n\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such as\nUPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the\nunderlying table.  For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the underlying\ntable.  There are also certain other constructs that make a view\nnon-updatable. To be more specific, a view is not updatable if it contains\nany of the following:\n\n\n --- Aggregate functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(),\nCOUNT(), and so forth)\n\n --- DISTINCT\n\n --- GROUP BY\n\n --- HAVING\n\n --- UNION or UNION ALL\n\n --- Subquery in the select list\n\n --- Join\n\n --- Non-updatable view in the FROM clause\n\n --- A subquery in the WHERE clause that refers to a table in the\nFROM clause\n\n --- Refers only to literal values (in this case, there is no underlying table to\nupdate)\n\n --- ALGORITHM = TEMPTABLE (use of a temporary table always makes a view\nnon-updatable)\n\n\nWith respect to insertability (being updatable with INSERT\nstatements), an updatable view is insertable if it also satisfies these\nadditional requirements for the view columns:\n\n\n --- There must be no duplicate view column names.\n\n --- The view must contain all columns in the base table that do not have a\ndefault value.\n\n --- The view columns must be simple column references and not derived columns.\nA derived column is one that is not a simple column reference but is derived\nfrom an expression.  These are examples of derived columns:\n\n3.14159\ncol1 + 3\nUPPER(col2)\ncol3 / col4\n(subquery)\n\n\nA view that has a mix of simple column references and derived columns is not\ninsertable, but it can be updatable if you update only those columns that\nare not derived.  Consider this view:\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT col1, 1 AS col2 FROM t;\n\nThis view is not insertable because col2 is derived from an\nexpression. But it is updatable if the update does not try to update\ncol2.  This update is allowable:\n\nUPDATE v SET col1 = 0;\n\nThis update is not allowable because it attempts to update a derived column:\n\nUPDATE v SET col2 = 0;\n\nIt is sometimes possible for a multiple-table view to be updatable, assuming\nthat it can be processed with the MERGE algorithm.  For this to work,\nthe view must use an inner join (not an outer join or a UNION). Also,\nonly a single table in the view definition can be updated, so the SET\nclause must name only columns from one of the tables in the view.  Views\nthat use UNION ALL are disallowed even though they might be\ntheoretically updatable, because the implementation uses temporary tables to\nprocess them.\n\n\nFor a multiple-table updatable view, INSERT can work if it inserts into a\nsingle table.  DELETE is not supported.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n",""),(359,23,"TRIM","   TRIM([{BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING} [remstr] FROM] str)\n   TRIM(remstr FROM] str)\nReturns the string str with all remstr prefixes and/or suffixes\nremoved.
