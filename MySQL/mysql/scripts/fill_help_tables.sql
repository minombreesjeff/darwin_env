They are saved to the *master.info file, but are ignored\nuntil you use a server that has SSL support enabled.\n\nIf you don't specify a given parameter, it keeps its old\nvalue, except as indicated in the following discussion. For example, if the password to connect to your MySQL master has\nchanged, you just need to issue these statements\nto tell the slave about the new password:\n\nmysql> STOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='new3cret';\nmysql> START SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication\n\nThere is no need to specify the parameters that do\nnot change (host, port, user, and so forth).\n\nMASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the hostname (or IP address) of\nthe master host and its TCP/IP port. Note that if MASTER_HOST is\nequal to localhost, then, like in other parts of MySQL, the port\nmay be ignored (if Unix socket files can be used, for example).\n\nIf you specify MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT,\nthe slave assumes that the master server is different than\nbefore (even if you specify a host or port value that is\nthe same as the current value.) In this case, the old values for the master\nbinary log name and position are considered no longer applicable, so if you\ndo not specify MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the\nstatement, MASTER_LOG_FILE='' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are\nsilently appended to it. \n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates\nat which the slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the\nnext time the thread starts.\nIf you specify either of them, you can't specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS are\nspecified, the slave uses the last coordinates of the /slave SQL thread/\nbefore CHANGE MASTER was issued. This ensures that\nreplication has no discontinuity, even if the slave SQL thread was late\ncompared to the slave I/O thread, when you just want to change, say, the\npassword to use. This safe behavior was introduced starting from MySQL\n4.0.17 and 4.1.1. (Before these versions, the coordinates used were \nthe last coordinates of the slave I/O thread before CHANGE MASTER\nwas issued. This caused the SQL thread to possibly lose some events\nfrom the master, thus breaking replication.)\n\nCHANGE MASTER /deletes all relay log files/ and starts\na new one, unless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay logs are kept;\nas of MySQL 4.1.1 the relay_log_purge global variable\nis set silently to 0.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO updates the contents of the *master.info and\n*relay-log.info files.\n\nCHANGE MASTER is useful for setting up a slave when you have\nthe snapshot of the master and have recorded the log and the offset\ncorresponding to it.  After loading the snapshot into the slave, you\ncan run CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',\nMASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master on the slave.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',\n    ->     MASTER_USER='replication',\n    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',\n    ->     MASTER_PORT=3306,\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n    ->     MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n",""),(145,28,"DROP DATABASE","DROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

The\n--local option causes mysqlimport to read data files from the\nclient host.  You can specify the --compress option to get better\nperformance over slow networks if the client and server support the\ncompressed protocol.\nSee also : [mysqlimport,  , mysqlimport].\n\nIf you specify the LOW_PRIORITY keyword, execution of the\nLOAD DATA statement is delayed until no other clients are reading\nfrom the table.\n\nIf you specify the CONCURRENT keyword with a MyISAM table that\nsatisfies the condition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free\nblocks in the middle),\nthen other threads can retrieve data from the table while LOAD DATA\nis executing. Using this option affects the performance of LOAD DATA\na bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same time.\n\nIf the LOCAL keyword is specified, it is\ninterpreted with respect to the client end of the connection:\n\n\n --- If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\nclient host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full pathname\nto specify its exact location. If given as a relative pathname, the name is\ninterpreted relative to the directory in which the client program was started.\n\n --- If LOCAL is not specified, the\nfile must be located on the server host and is read directly by the server.\n\n\nLOCAL is available in MySQL 3.22.6 or later.\n\nWhen locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:\n\n --- If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.\n\n --- If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,\nthe server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.\n\n --- If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for\nthe file in the database directory of the default database.\n\nNote that these rules mean that a file named as *./myfile.txt is read from\nthe server's data directory, whereas the same file named as *myfile.txt is\nread from the database directory of the default database.  For example,\nthe following LOAD DATA statement reads the file *data.txt\nfrom the database directory for db1 because db1 is the current\ndatabase, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a\ntable in the db2 database:\n\nmysql> USE db1;\nmysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;\n\nNote that Windows pathnames are specified using forward slashes rather than\nbackslashes.  If you do use backslashes, you must double them.\n\nFor security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the\nfiles must either reside in the database directory or be readable by all.\nAlso, to use LOAD DATA INFILE on server files, you must have the\nFILE privilege.\n","LOAD DATA [LOW_PRIORITY | CONCURRENT] [LOCAL] INFILE 'file_name.txt'\n    [REPLACE | IGNORE]\n    INTO TABLE tbl_name\n    [FIELDS\n        [TERMINATED BY '\\t']\n        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY '']\n        [ESCAPED BY '\\\\' ]\n    ]\n    [LINES \n        [STARTING BY '']    \n        [TERMINATED BY '\\n']\n    ]\n    [IGNORE number LINES]\n    [(col_name,...)]"),(325,14,"LOCALTIME","   LOCALTIME\n   LOCALTIME()\n\nLOCALTIME and LOCALTIME() are synonyms for\nNOW().\n",""),(326,3,"MPOINTFROMTEXT","   MPointFromText(wkt[,srid])\n   MultiPointFromText(wkt[,srid])\nConstructs a MULTIPOINT value using its WKT representation and SRID.\n",""),(327,1,"BLOB","A BLOB is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of\ndata.

For example, CHAR(500) is converted to\nTEXT, and CHAR(200000) is converted to MEDIUMTEXT.\nThis is a compatibility feature.  However, this conversion causes the\ncolumn to become a variable-length column, and also affects trailing-space\nremoval.\n\nCHAR is shorthand for CHARACTER.\nNATIONAL CHAR (or its equivalent short form, NCHAR) is the\nstandard SQL way to define that a CHAR column should use the default\ncharacter set.  This is the default in MySQL.\n\nAs of MySQL 4.1.2, the BINARY attribute is shorthand for specifying\nthe binary collation of the column character set. Before 4.1.2, BINARY\nattribute causes the column to be treated as a binary string.  In either\ncase, sorting and comparisons become case sensitive.\n\nFrom MySQL 4.1.0 on, the ASCII attribute can be specified. It\nassigns the latin1 character set to a CHAR column.\n\nFrom MySQL 4.1.1 on, the UNICODE attribute can be specified. It\nassigns the ucs2 character set to a CHAR column.\n\nMySQL allows you to create a column of type CHAR(0). This is mainly\nuseful when you have to be compliant with some old applications that depend\non the existence of a column but that do not actually use the value.  This\nis also quite nice when you need a column that can take only two values: A\nCHAR(0) column that is not defined as NOT NULL occupies only\none bit and can take only the values NULL and '' (the empty\nstring).\n\n   CHAR\nThis is a synonym for CHAR(1).\n","");
