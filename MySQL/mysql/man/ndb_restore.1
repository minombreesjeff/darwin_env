.PP
The cluster restoration program is implemented as a separate command\-line utility
\fBndb_restore\fR, which can normally be found in the MySQL
bin
directory\&. This program reads the files created as a result of the backup and inserts the stored information into the database\&.
.PP
\fBndb_restore\fR
must be executed once for each of the backup files that were created by the
START BACKUP
command used to create the backup (see
Section\ \&17.5.3.2, \(lqUsing The MySQL Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup\(rq)\&. This is equal to the number of data nodes in the cluster at the time that the backup was created\&.

Before using
\fBndb_restore\fR, it is recommended that the cluster be running in single user mode, unless you are restoring multiple data nodes in parallel\&. See
Section\ \&17.5.6, \(lqMySQL Cluster Single User Mode\(rq, for more information about single user mode\&.

The following table includes options that are specific to the MySQL Cluster backup restoration program
\fBndb_restore\fR\&. Additional descriptions follow the table\&. For options common to all MySQL Cluster programs, see
Section\ \&17.4.2, \(lqOptions Common to MySQL Cluster Programs\(rq\&.
.PP
Typical options for this utility are shown here:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_restore [\-c \fIconnectstring\fR] \-n
\fInode_id\fR [\-m] \-b \fIbackup_id\fR \-r \-\-backup_path=\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
option is used to specify a connectstring which tells
ndb_restore
where to locate the cluster management server\&. (See
Section\ \&17.3.2.2, \(lqThe MySQL Cluster Connectstring\(rq, for information on connectstrings\&.) If this option is not used, then
\fBndb_restore\fR
attempts to connect to a management server on
localhost:1186\&. This utility acts as a cluster API node, and so requires a free connection
\(lqslot\(rq
to connect to the cluster management server\&. This means that there must be at least one
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section that can be used by it in the cluster
config\&.ini
file\&. It is a good idea to keep at least one empty
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section in
config\&.ini
that is not being used for a MySQL server or other application for this reason (see
Section\ \&17.3.2.6, \(lqDefining SQL and Other API Nodes in a MySQL Cluster\(rq)\&.
.PP
You can verify that
\fBndb_restore\fR
is connected to the cluster by using the
\fBSHOW\fR
command in the
\fBndb_mgm\fR
management client\&. You can also accomplish this from a system shell, as shown here:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm \-e "SHOW"\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fB\-n\fR
is used to specify the node ID of the data node on which the backups were taken\&.
.PP
The first time you run the
\fBndb_restore\fR
restoration program, you also need to restore the metadata\&. In other words, you must re\-create the database tables \(em this can be done by running it with the
\fB\-m\fR
option\&. Note that the cluster should have an empty database when starting to restore a backup\&. (In other words, you should start
\fBndbd\fR
with
\fB\-\-initial\fR
prior to performing the restore\&.)
.PP
The
\fB\-b\fR
option is used to specify the ID or sequence number of the backup, and is the same number shown by the management client in the
Backup \fIbackup_id\fR completed
message displayed upon completion of a backup\&. (See
Section\ \&17.5.3.2, \(lqUsing The MySQL Cluster Management Client to Create a Backup\(rq\&.)

When restoring cluster backups, you must be sure to restore all data nodes from backups having the same backup ID\&. Using files from different backups will at best result in restoring the cluster to an inconsistent state, and may fail altogether\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The path to the backup directory is required; this is supplied to
\fBndb_restore\fR
using the
\fB\-\-backup_path\fR
option, and must include the subdirectory corresponding to the ID backup of the backup to be restored\&. For example, if the data node\'s
DataDir
is
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster, then the backup directory is
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster/BACKUP, and the backup files for the backup with the ID 3 can be found in
/var/lib/mysql\-cluster/BACKUP/BACKUP\-3\&. The path may be absolute or relative to the directory in which the
\fBndb_restore\fR
executable is located, and may be optionally prefixed with
\fBbackup_path=\fR\&.

Previous to MySQL 5\&.0\&.38, the path to the backup directory was specified as shown here, with
\fBbackup_path=\fR
being optional:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[backup_path=]\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Beginning with MySQL 5\&.0\&.38, this syntax changed to
\fB\-\-backup_path=\fR\fB\fI/path/to/backup/files\fR\fR, to conform more closely with options used by other MySQL programs;
\fB\-\-backup_id\fR
is required, and there is no short form for this option\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
It is possible to restore a backup to a database with a different configuration than it was created from\&. For example, suppose that a backup with backup ID
12, created in a cluster with two database nodes having the node IDs
2
and
3, is to be restored to a cluster with four nodes\&. Then
\fBndb_restore\fR
must be run twice \(em once for each database node in the cluster where the backup was taken\&. However,
\fBndb_restore\fR
cannot always restore backups made from a cluster running one version of MySQL to a cluster running a different MySQL version\&. See
Section\ \&17.2.6.2, \(lqMySQL Cluster 5.0 Upgrade and Downgrade Compatibility\(rq, for more information\&.

.PP
It is not possible to restore a backup made from a newer version of MySQL Cluster using an older version of
\fBndb_restore\fR\&. You can restore a backup made from a newer version of MySQL to an older cluster, but you must use a copy of
\fBndb_restore\fR
from the newer MySQL Cluster version to do so\&.
.PP
For example, to restore a cluster backup taken from a cluster running MySQL 5\&.0\&.45 to a cluster running MySQL Cluster 5\&.0\&.41, you must use a copy of
\fBndb_restore\fR
from the 5\&.0\&.45 distribution\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
For more rapid restoration, the data may be restored in parallel, provided that there is a sufficient number of cluster connections available\&. That is, when restoring to multiple nodes in parallel, you must have an
[api]
or
[mysqld]
section in the cluster
config\&.ini
file available for each concurrent
\fBndb_restore\fR
process\&. However, the data files must always be applied before the logs\&.
