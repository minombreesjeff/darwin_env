This is the MySQL reference manual; it documents MySQL
Version 3.23.51.  As MySQL is work in progress,
the manual gets updated frequently.  There is a very good chance that
this version is out of date, unless you are looking at it online.  The
most recent version of this manual is available at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/</a> in many different formats.  If you
have a hard time finding information in the manual, you can try the
searchable PHP version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php</a>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>MySQL is a database management system.
<DD>
A database is a structured collection of data.  It may be anything from a
simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of
information in a corporate network.  To add, access, and process data
stored in a computer database, you need a database management system
such as MySQL.  Since computers are very good at handling large
amounts of data, database management plays a central role in computing,
as stand-alone utilities, or as parts of other applications.

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>

<DT>MySQL is a relational database management system.
<DD>
A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting
all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and flexibility.  The
tables are linked by defined relations making it possible to combine
data from several tables on request.  The SQL part of MySQL
stands for "Structured Query Language" - the most common standardized
language used to access databases.

<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<DT>MySQL is Open Source Software.
<DD>
Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify.
Anybody can download MySQL from the Internet and use it
without paying anything.  Anybody so inclined can study the source code
and change it to fit their needs.  MySQL uses the GPL (GNU
General Public License) <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>, to define what you
may and may not do with the software in different situations.  If you
feel uncomfortable with the GPL or need to embed MySQL into a
commercial application you can buy a commercially licensed version from
us.

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

<DT>Why use MySQL?
<DD>
MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.  If that is what
you are looking for, you should give it a try.  MySQL also has a
very practical set of features developed in very close cooperation with
our users.  You can find a performance comparison of MySQL
to some other database managers on our benchmark page.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

MySQL was originally developed to handle very large databases
much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in
highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though
under constant development, MySQL today offers a rich and very
useful set of functions.  The connectivity, speed, and security make
MySQL highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

<DT>The technical features of MySQL
<DD>
For advanced technical information, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Reference">6  MySQL Language Reference</A>.  MySQL is
a client/server system that consists of a multi-threaded SQL server
that supports different backends, several different client programs and
libraries, administrative tools, and several programming interfaces.

We also provide MySQL as a multi-threaded library which you can
link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier to manage
product.

<DT>MySQL has a lot of contributed software available.
<DD>
It is very likely that you will find that your favorite application or
language already supports MySQL.

MY-SEQUEL). But we try to avoid correcting people who say MY-SEQUEL.

<A NAME="IDX24"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>constant</CODE>
<DD>
Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL statements;
database, table and column names; C and Perl code; and environment variables.
Example: ``To see how <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> works, invoke it with the
<CODE>--help</CODE> option.''

<DT><TT>`filename'</TT>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and
pathnames.  Example: ``The distribution is installed under the
<TT>`/usr/local/'</TT> directory.''

<DT><SAMP>`c'</SAMP>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate
character sequences.  Example: ``To specify a wild card, use the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
character.''

<DT><EM>italic</EM>
<DD>
Italic font is used for emphasis, <EM>like this</EM>.

<DT><STRONG>boldface</STRONG>
<DD>
Boldface font is used for access privilege names (for example, ``do not grant
the <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege lightly'') and occasionally to convey
<STRONG>especially strong emphasis</STRONG>.
</DL>

<P>
When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular
program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.  For
example, <CODE>shell&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from your login
shell, and <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client program:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; type a shell command here
mysql&#62; type a mysql command here
</PRE>

<P>
Shell commands are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you are using a
<CODE>csh</CODE>-style shell, you may need to issue commands slightly differently.
For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command
looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; VARNAME=value some_command
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>csh</CODE>, you would execute the sequence like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; setenv VARNAME value
shell&#62; some_command
</PRE>

<P>
Often, database, table, and column names must be substituted into commands.  To
indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual uses
<CODE>db_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> and <CODE>col_name</CODE>.  For example, you might
see a statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would supply
your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;
</PRE>

<P>
SQL statements may be written in uppercase or lowercase.  When this manual
shows a SQL statement, uppercase is used for particular keywords if those
keywords are under discussion (to emphasize them) and lowercase is used for
the rest of the statement.  For example, you might see the following in a
discussion of the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT count(*) FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
On the other hand, in a discussion of the <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> function, the
same statement would be written like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select COUNT(*) from tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If no particular emphasis is intended, all keywords are written uniformly
in uppercase.

</P>
<P>
In syntax descriptions, square brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>) are used
to indicate optional words or clauses:

</P>

<PRE>
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the alternatives
are separated by vertical bars (<SAMP>`|'</SAMP>).  When one member from a set of
choices <STRONG>may</STRONG> be chosen, the alternatives are listed within square
brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)
</PRE>

<P>
When one member from a set of choices <STRONG>must</STRONG> be chosen, the
alternatives are listed within braces (<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
{DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name {col_name | wild}

We once started out with the intention of using <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to connect to our
tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some
testing we came to the conclusion that <CODE>mSQL</CODE> was not fast enough nor
flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to our
database but with almost the same API interface as <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.  This API was
chosen to ease porting of third-party code.

</P>
<P>
The derivation of the name MySQL is not perfectly clear.  Our base
directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix
``my'' for well over 10 years.  However, Monty's daughter (some years younger)
is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to MySQL is
still a mystery, even for us.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following list describes some of the important characteristics
of MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can easily
use multiple CPUs if available.

<LI>

C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Tcl APIs.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Clients">8  MySQL APIs</A>.

<LI>

Works on many different platforms.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.

<LI>

Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes
long, <CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>,
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>YEAR</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, and <CODE>ENUM</CODE> types. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>.

<LI>

Very fast joins using an optimized one-sweep multi-join.

<LI>

Full operator and function support in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
parts of queries.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name) FROM tbl_name
           WHERE income/dependents &#62; 10000 AND age &#62; 30;
</PRE>

<LI>

SQL functions are implemented through a highly optimized class library and
should be as fast as possible!  Usually there isn't any memory allocation 
at all after query initialization.

<LI>

Full support for SQL <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses.  Support 
for group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>, 
<CODE>AVG()</CODE>, <CODE>STD()</CODE>, <CODE>SUM()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and <CODE>MIN()</CODE>).

<LI>

Support for <CODE>LEFT OUTER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</CODE> with ANSI
SQL and ODBC syntax.

<LI>

You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as of
Version 3.22).

<LI>

A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure, and
allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because all
password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.

<LI>

ODBC (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) support for Win32 (with source).  All
ODBC 2.5 functions and many others.  For example, you can use MS Access to
connect to your MySQL server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC">8.3  MySQL ODBC Support</A>.

<LI>

Very fast B-tree disk tables with index compression.

<LI>

Up to 32 indexes per table are allowed.  Each index may consist of 1 to 16
columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index length is 500 bytes (this
may be changed when compiling MySQL).  An index may use a prefix
of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> field.

<LI>

Fixed-length and variable-length records.

<LI>

In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.

<LI>

Handles large databases.  We are using MySQL with some
databases that contain 50,000,000 records and we know of users that
uses MySQL with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows

<LI>

All columns have default values.  You can use <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to insert a
subset of a table's columns; those columns that are not explicitly given
values are set to their default values.

<LI>

Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.

<LI>

Written in C and C++.  Tested with a broad range of different compilers.

<LI>

A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.

<LI>

No memory leaks.  MySQL has been tested with Purify, a commercial
memory leakage detector.

<LI>

Includes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, a very fast utility for table checking,
optimization, and repair.  All of the functionality of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is also available through the SQL interface as well.  
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  MySQL Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

Full support for several different character sets, including
ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), big5, ujis, and more.  For example, the
Scandinavian characters `@ringaccent{a}', `@"a' and `@"o' are allowed
in table and column names.

<LI>

All data are saved in the chosen character set.  All comparisons for normal
string columns are case insensitive.

<LI>

Sorting is done according to the chosen character set (the Swedish
way by default).  It is possible to change this when the MySQL server
is started up.  To see an example of very advanced sorting, look at the
Czech sorting code.  MySQL supports many different character sets
that can be specified at compile and run time.

<LI>

Aliases on tables and columns are allowed as in the SQL92 standard.

<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> return
the number of rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return
the number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the
server.

<LI>

Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For example, 
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is a valid column name.  The only restriction is that for a 
function call, no spaces are allowed between the function name and the 
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> that follows it.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reserved_words">6.1.6  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?</A>.

<LI>

All MySQL programs can be invoked with the <CODE>--help</CODE> or <CODE>-?</CODE>
options to obtain online assistance.

<LI>

The server can provide error messages to clients in many languages. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.

<LI>

Clients may connect to the MySQL server using TCP/IP Sockets,
Unix Sockets (Unix), or Named Pipes (NT).

<LI>

The MySQL-specific <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command can be used to retrieve
information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
can be used to determine how the optimizer resolves a query.

mid-1996.  When MySQL was released to a wider public, we noticed that
there were some pieces of ``untested code'' that were quickly found by the
new users who made queries in a manner different than our own.  Each new
release has had fewer portability problems than the previous one (even though
each has had many new features).

</P>
<P>
Each release of MySQL has been usable, and there have been problems
only when users start to use code from the ``gray zones.''  Naturally, outside
users don't know what the gray zones are; this section attempts to indicate
those that are currently known.  The descriptions deal with Version 3.23
of MySQL.  All known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest 
version, with the exception of the bugs listed in the bugs section, which 
are things that are design-related.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.4.7  Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL is written in multiple layers and different independent
modules.  These modules are listed below with an indication of how
well-tested each of them is:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>The ISAM table handler -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
This manages storage and retrieval of all data in MySQL Version 3.22
and earlier.  In all MySQL releases there hasn't been a single 
(reported) bug in this code. The only known way to get a corrupted table 
is to kill the server in the middle of an update.  Even that is unlikely 
to destroy any data beyond rescue, because all data are flushed to disk 
between each query.  There hasn't been a single bug report about lost data 
because of bugs in MySQL.

<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>

<DT><STRONG>The MyISAM table handler -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
This is new in MySQL Version 3.23.  It's largely based on the ISAM
table code but has a lot of new and very useful features.

<DT><STRONG>The parser and lexical analyser -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
There hasn't been a single reported bug in this system for a long time.

<DT><STRONG>The C client code -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
No known problems.  In early Version 3.20 releases, there were some limitations
in the send/receive buffer size.  As of Version 3.21, the buffer size is now
dynamic up to a default of 16M.

<DT><STRONG>Standard client programs -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
These include <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Basic SQL -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
The basic SQL function system and string classes and dynamic memory
handling.  Not a single reported bug in this system.

<DT><STRONG>Query optimizer -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Range optimizer -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Join optimizer -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Locking -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
This is very system-dependent.  On some systems there are big problems
using standard OS locking (<CODE>fcntl()</CODE>).  In these cases, you should run the
MySQL daemon with the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> flag.  Problems are known
to occur on some Linux systems, and on SunOS when using NFS-mounted file
systems.

<DT><STRONG>Linux threads -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
The major problem found has been with the <CODE>fcntl()</CODE> call, which is
fixed by using the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  Some people have reported lockup problems with Version 0.5.
LinuxThreads will need to be recompiled if you plan to use
1000+ concurrent connections.  Although it is possible to run that many
connections with the default LinuxThreads (however, you will never go
above 1021), the default stack spacing of 2 MB makes the application
unstable, and we have been able to reproduce a coredump after creating
1021 idle connections.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Linux">2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A>.

<DT><STRONG>Solaris 2.5+ pthreads -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
We use this for all our production work.

<DT><STRONG>MIT-pthreads (Other systems) -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
There have been no reported bugs since Version 3.20.15 and no known bugs since
Version 3.20.16.  On some systems, there is a ``misfeature'' where some
operations are quite slow (a 1/20 second sleep is done between each query).
Of course, MIT-pthreads may slow down everything a bit, but index-based
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are usually done in one time frame so there shouldn't
be a mutex locking/thread juggling.

<DT><STRONG>Other thread implementions -- Beta - Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
The ports to other systems are still very new and may have bugs, possibly
in MySQL, but most often in the thread implementation itself.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>LOAD DATA ...</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
Some people thought they had found bugs here, but these usually have
turned out to be misunderstandings.  Please check the manual before reporting
problems!

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
Small changes in Version 3.22.12.

<DT><STRONG>DBD -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
Now maintained by Jochen Wiedmann 
(<a HREF="mailto:wiedmann@neckar-alb.de">wiedmann@neckar-alb.de</a>).  Thanks!

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
Written and maintained by Yves Carlier 
(<a HREF="mailto:Yves.Carlier@rug.ac.be">Yves.Carlier@rug.ac.be</a>). Thanks!

<DT><STRONG><CODE>GRANT</CODE> -- Stable</STRONG>
<DD>
Big changes made in MySQL Version 3.22.12.

<DT><STRONG><STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> (uses ODBC SDK 2.5) -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
It seems to work well with some programs.

<DT><STRONG>Replication -- Beta / Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
We are still working on replication, so don't expect this to be rock
solid yet.  On the other hand, some MySQL users are already
using this with good results.

<DT><STRONG>BDB Tables -- Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
The Berkeley DB code is very stable, but we are still improving the interface
between MySQL and BDB tables, so it will take some time before this
is as tested as the other table types.

<DT><STRONG>InnoDB Tables -- Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
This is a recent addition to <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. They appear to work good and
can be used after some initial testing.

<DT><STRONG>Automatic recovery of MyISAM tables - Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
This only affects the new code that checks if the table was closed properly
on open and executes an automatic check/repair of the table if it wasn't.

<DT><STRONG>MERGE tables -- Beta / Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
The usage of keys on <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables is still not that tested.  The
other part of the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> code is quite well tested.

<DT><STRONG>FULLTEXT -- Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
Text search seems to work, but is still not widely used.

</DL>

<P>
MySQL AB provides e-mail support for paying customers, but the 
MySQL mailing list usually provides answers to common questions.
Bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch; for serious bugs, there is
almost always a new release.

MySQL Version 3.22 has a 4G limit on table size. With the new
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> in MySQL Version 3.23 the maximum table size is
pushed up to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes).

</P>
<P>
Note, however, that operating systems have their own file size
limits. Here are some examples:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Operating System</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>File Size Limit</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Intel 32 bit </TD><TD> 2G, 4G or more, depends on Linux version
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Alpha </TD><TD> 8T (?)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.5.1 </TD><TD> 2G (possible 4G with patch)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.7 ULTRA-SPARC </TD><TD> 8T (?)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
On Linux 2.2 you can get bigger tables than 2G by using the LFS patch for
the ext2 file system.  On Linux 2.4 there exists also patches for ReiserFS
to get support for big files.

</P>
<P>
This means that the table size for MySQL is normally limited by
the operating system.

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL tables have a maximum size of about 4G.  You can
check the maximum table size for a table with the <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE>
command or with the <CODE>myisamchk -dv table_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.5  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you need bigger tables than 4G (and your operating system supports
this), you should set the <CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> and <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE>
parameter when you create your table.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
also set these later with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your big table is going to be read-only, you could use
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to merge and compress many tables to one.
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> usually compresses a table by at least 50%, so you can
have, in effect, much bigger tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can go around the operating system file limit for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> data
files by using the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another solution can be the included MERGE library, which allows you to
handle a collection of identical tables as one. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  MERGE Tables</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Year_2000_compliance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.1.9  Year 2000 Compliance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL uses Unix time functions and has no problems with dates
until <CODE>2069</CODE>; all 2-digit years are regarded to be in the range
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE>, which means that if you store <CODE>01</CODE> in a
<CODE>year</CODE> column, MySQL treats it as <CODE>2001</CODE>.

<LI>

All MySQL date functions are stored in one file <TT>`sql/time.cc'</TT>
and coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22 and later, the new <CODE>YEAR</CODE> column type
can store years <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE> in 1 byte and display
them using 2 or 4 digits.
</UL>

<P>
You may run into problems with applications that use MySQL in a
way that is not Y2K-safe.  For example, many old applications store
or manipulate years using 2-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than
4-digit values.  This problem may be compounded by applications that use
values such as <CODE>00</CODE> or <CODE>99</CODE> as ``missing'' value indicators.

</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix, because different
applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may
use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.

</P>
<P>
Here is a simple demonstration illustrating that MySQL doesn't have
any problems with dates until the year 2030:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS y2k;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE y2k (date date, date_time datetime, time_stamp timestamp);

This shows that the <CODE>DATE</CODE> and <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> types will not
give any problems with future dates (they handle dates until the year
9999).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> type, which is used to store the current time, has a
range up to only <CODE>2030-01-01</CODE>.  <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> has a range of
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>2030</CODE> on 32-bit machines (signed value).  On 64-bit
machines it handles times up to <CODE>2106</CODE> (unsigned value).

Even though MySQL is Y2K-compliant, it is your responsibility to
provide unambiguous input.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Y2K_issues">6.2.2.1  Y2K Issues and Date Types</A> for MySQL's rules
for dealing with ambiguous date input data (data containing 2-digit year

Foreword by Michael ``Monty'' Widenius, MySQL Moderator.
<BR>

</P>
<P>
In <EM>MySQL</EM>, Paul DuBois provides you with a comprehensive guide to
one of the most popular relational database systems.  Paul has
contributed to the online documentation for MySQL and is an
active member of the MySQL community.  The principal MySQL
developer, Monty Widenius, and a network of his fellow developers
reviewed the manuscript, and provided Paul with the kind of insight
no one else could supply.
<BR>

</P>
<P>
Instead of merely giving you a general overview of MySQL, Paul
teaches you how to make the most of its capabilities.  Through two
sample database applications that run throughout the book, he
gives you solutions to problems you're sure to face.  He helps you
integrate MySQL efficiently with third-party tools, such as PHP
and Perl, enabling you to generate dynamic Web pages through
database queries.  He teaches you to write programs that access
MySQL databases, and also provides a comprehensive set of
references to column types, operators, functions, SQL syntax,
MySQL programming, C API, Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>, and PHP API.
<EM>MySQL</EM> simply gives you the kind of information you won't find
anywhere else.
<BR>

</P>
<P>
If you use MySQL, this book provides you with:

<UL>
<LI>

An introduction to MySQL and SQL.
<LI>

Coverage of MySQL's data types and how to use them.
<LI>

Thorough treatment of how to write client programs in C.
<LI>

A guide to using the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE> and PHP APIs for developing
command-line and Web-based applications.
<LI>

Tips on administrative issues such as user accounts, backup,
crash recovery, and security.
<LI>

Help in choosing an ISP for MySQL access.
<LI>

A comprehensive reference for MySQL's data types, operators,
functions, and SQL statements and utilities.
<LI>

Complete reference guides for MySQL's C API, the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE> API,

This book teaches you how to use MySQL and <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, two popular
and robust database products that support key subsets of SQL on both Linux
and Unix systems.  Anyone who knows basic C, Java, Perl, or Python can
write a program to interact with a database, either as a stand-alone
application or through a Web page.  This book takes you through the
whole process, from installation and configuration to programming
interfaces and basic administration.  Includes plenty of tutorial
material.

In this follow-up to the best-selling <EM>Beginning Linux Programming</EM>,
you will learn from the authors' real-world knowledge and experience of
developing software for Linux; you'll be taken through the development
of a sample 'DVD Store' application, with 'theme' chapters addressing
different aspects of its implementation.  Meanwhile, individual
``take-a-break'' chapters cover important topics that go beyond the
bounds of the central theme.  All focus on the practical aspects of
programming, showing how crucial it is to choose the right tools for
the job, use them as they should be used, and get things right first
time.

<EM>PHP and MySQL Web Development</EM> introduces you to the advantages
of implementing both MySQL and PHP.  These advantages are detailed
through the provision of both statistics and several case studies.  A
practical web application is developed throughout the book, providing
you with the tools necessary to implement a functional online
database.  Each function is developed separately, allowing you the
choice to incorporate only those parts that you would like to
implement.  Programming concepts of the PHP language are highlighted,
including functions which tie MySQL support into a PHP script and
advanced topics regarding table manipulation.

<EM>C++ For Real Programmers</EM> bridges the gap between C++ as described
in beginner and intermediate-level books and C++ as it is practiced by
experts.  Numerous valuable techniques are described, organized into
three simple themes: indirection, class hierarchies, and memory
management.  It also provides in-depth coverage of template creation,
exception handling, pointers and optimization techniques.  The focus of
the book is on ANSI C++ and, as such, is compiler independent.

Before posting a bug report or question, please do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start by searching the MySQL online manual at:
<BR>
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php</a>
<BR>
We try to keep the manual up to date by updating it frequently with 
solutions to newly found problems!

<LI>

Search the MySQL mailing list archives:
<BR>
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/</a>
<BR>
<LI>

You can also use <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/search.html">http://www.mysql.com/search.html</a> to search all the
Web pages (including the manual) that are located at 
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>.
</UL>

<P>
If you can't find an answer in the manual or the archives, check with your
local MySQL expert.  If you still can't find an answer to your
question, go ahead and read the next section about how to send mail to
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.

Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first
time saves time for us and for you.  A good bug report containing a full
test case for the bug will make it very likely that we will fix it in
the next release.  This section will help you write your report correctly
so that you don't waste your time doing things that may not help us much
or at all.

</P>
<P>
We encourage everyone to use the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script to generate a bug
report (or a report about any problem), if possible.  <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> can be
found in the <TT>`scripts'</TT> directory in the source distribution, or, for a
binary distribution, in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under your MySQL
installation directory.  If you are unable to use <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>, you should
still include all the necessary information listed in this section.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script helps you generate a report by determining much
of the following information automatically, but if something important is
missing, please include it with your message!  Please read this section
carefully and make sure that all the information described here is included
in your report.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
The normal place to report bugs and problems is
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.  If you can make a test case that clearly
demonstrates the bug, you should post it to the <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>
list.  Note that on this list you should only post a full, repeatable bug
report using the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script.  If you are running on Windows,
you should include a description of the operating system and the
MySQL version.  Preferably, you should test the problem using
the latest stable or development version of MySQL before
posting!  Anyone should be able to repeat the bug by just using
``<CODE>mysql test &#60; script</CODE>'' on the included test case or run the
shell or perl script that is included in the bug report.  All bugs
posted on the <CODE>bugs</CODE> list will be corrected or documented in the next
MySQL release!  If there are only small code changes involved
to correct this problem, we will also post a patch that fixes the
problem.

</P>
<P>
Remember that it is possible to respond to a message containing too much
information, but not to one containing too little.  Often people omit facts
because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume that some
details don't matter.  A good principle is: if you are in doubt about stating
something, state it!  It is a thousand times faster and less troublesome to
write a couple of lines more in your report than to be forced to ask again
and wait for the answer because you didn't include enough information the
first time.

</P>
<P>
The most common errors are that people don't indicate the version number of
the MySQL distribution they are using, or don't indicate what
platform they have MySQL installed on (including the platform
version number).  This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of
100 the bug report is useless without it!  Very often we get questions like,
``Why doesn't this work for me?'' then we find that the feature
requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug
described in a report has been fixed already in newer MySQL
versions.  Sometimes the error is platform dependent; in such cases, it is
next to impossible to fix anything without knowing the operating system and
the version number of the platform.

</P>
<P>
Remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is related to
the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all the time and
become better version by version.  To determine whether or not your
problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler is used.
Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug report and
reported accordingly.

</P>
<P>
It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included in the
bug report.  That is, a good example of all the things you did that led to
the problem and the problem itself exactly described.  The best reports are
those that include a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or
problem.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">G.1.6  Making a test case when you experience table corruption</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include the
message in your report!  If we try to search for something from the archives
using programs, it is better that the error message reported exactly matches
the one that the program produces.  (Even the case should be observed!) 
You should never try to remember what the error message was; instead, copy 
and paste the entire message into your report!

</P>
<P>
If you have a problem with MyODBC, you should try to generate a MyODBC
trace file.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyODBC_bug_report">8.3.7  Reporting Problems with MyODBC</A>.

</P>
<P>
Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will
do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples
using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line tool, you should therefore use
the <CODE>--vertical</CODE> option (or the <CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator)
for output that would exceed the available width for such a display
(for example, with the <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> statement; see the
example below).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Please include the following information in your report:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
example, MySQL Version 3.22.22). You can find out which version you
are running by executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can be
found in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

The manufacturer and model of the machine you are working on.

<LI>

The operating system name and version.  For most operating systems, you can
get this information by executing the Unix command <CODE>uname -a</CODE>.

<LI>

Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If in doubt, 
include these values.

<LI>

If you are using a source distribution of MySQL, the name and
version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a binary 
distribution, the distribution name is needed.

<LI>

If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error
message(s) and also a few lines of context around the offending code in the
file where the error occurred.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should also report the query that crashed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  You can usually find this out by running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
logging enabled.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_log_files">G.1.5  Using log files to find cause of errors in mysqld</A>.

<LI>

If any database table is related to the problem, include the output from
<CODE>mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ...</CODE>.  This is very easy
to do and is a powerful way to get information about any table in a database
that will help us create a situation matching the one you have.

<LI>

For speed-related bugs or problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, you should
always include the output of <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE>, and at least the
number of rows that the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement produces.  The more
information you give about your situation, the more likely it is that someone
can help you!  For example, the following is an example of a very good bug
report (it should of course be posted with the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script):

Example run using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line tool (note the use of the
<CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator for statements whose output width would
otherwise exceed that of an 80-column display device):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW VARIABLES;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
       &#60;output from SHOW COLUMNS&#62;
mysql&#62; EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
       &#60;output from EXPLAIN&#62;
mysql&#62; FLUSH STATUS;
mysql&#62; SELECT ...;
       &#60;A short version of the output from SELECT,
       including the time taken to run the query&#62;
mysql&#62; SHOW STATUS;
       &#60;output from SHOW STATUS&#62;
</PRE>

<LI>

If a bug or problem occurs while running <STRONG>mysqld</STRONG>, try to provide an
input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script should include any
necessary source files.  The more closely the script can reproduce your
situation, the better.  If you can make a repeatable test case, you should
post this to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> for a high priority treatment!

If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the output
from <CODE>mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist</CODE> in your mail to
provide some information of how your system is performing!

<LI>

If you can't produce a test case in a few rows, or if the test table
is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10 rows), you should
dump your tables using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and create a <TT>`README'</TT> file
that describes your problem.

Create a compressed archive of your files using
<CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>gzip</CODE> or <CODE>zip</CODE>, and use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer the 
archive to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  Then send a 
short description of the problem to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>.

<LI>

If you think that MySQL produces a strange result from a query,
include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the result
should be, and an account describing the basis for your opinion.

<LI>

When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the variable names,
table names, etc., that exist in your actual situation than to come up with
new names.  The problem could be related to the name of a variable or table!
These cases are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
After all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your 
actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case you have data
you don't want to show to others, you can use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer it to 
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  If the data are really top
secret and you don't want to show them even to us, then go ahead and provide 
an example using other names, but please regard this as the last choice.

<LI>

Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if possible.  For
example, indicate the options that you use when you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
daemon and that you use to run any MySQL client programs.  The
options to programs like <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>mysql</CODE>, and to the
<CODE>configure</CODE> script, are often keys to answers and are very relevant!
It is never a bad idea to include them anyway!  If you use any modules, such
as Perl or PHP, please include the version number(s) of those as well.

<LI>

If your question is related to the privilege system, please include the
output of <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>, the output of <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>, and all
the error messages you get when trying to connect!  When you test your
privileges, you should first run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.  After this, execute
<CODE>mysqladmin reload version</CODE> and try to connect with the program that
gives you trouble.  <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`bin'</TT>
directory under your MySQL installation directory.

<LI>

If you have a patch for a bug, that is good, but don't assume the patch is
all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide some necessary
information, such as test cases showing the bug that your patch fixes.  We
might find problems with your patch or we might not understand it at all; if
so, we can't use it.

If we can't verify exactly what the patch is meant for, we won't use it.
Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will handle all the
situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline case (even a rare one)
where the patch won't work, it may be useless.

<LI>

Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends on,
are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things
without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a bug.

<LI>

Indicate in your mail message that you have checked the reference manual
and mail archive so others know that you have tried to solve the
problem yourself.

<LI>

If you get a <CODE>parse error</CODE>, please check your syntax closely!  If
you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that your
current version of MySQL doesn't support the query you are
using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php</a> doesn't cover the
syntax you are using, MySQL doesn't support your query.  In this
case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or e-mail
<a HREF="mailto:mysql-licensing@mysql.com">mysql-licensing@mysql.com</a> and ask for an offer to implement it!

If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an older version
of MySQL, you should check the MySQL change history to see
when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have the option of 
upgrading to a newer version of MySQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">F  MySQL change history</A>.

<LI>

If you have a problem such that your data appears corrupt or you get
errors when you access some particular table, you should first check and then
try repairing your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  MySQL Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

If you often get corrupted tables you should try to find out when and why this
happens!  In this case, the <TT>`mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'</TT> file 
may contain some information about what happened.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.  Please
include any relevant information from this file in your bug report!  Normally 
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> should <STRONG>NEVER</STRONG> crash a table if nothing killed it in the
middle of an update!  If you can find the cause of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dying,
it's much easier for us to provide you with a fix for the problem!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A>.

<LI>

If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL
and check whether or not it solves your problem.  All versions of 
MySQL are thoroughly tested and should work without problems!  We 
believe in making everything as backward compatible as possible, and you 
should be able to switch MySQL versions in minutes!

Basically, our licensing policy and interpretation of the GPL is as follows:

Note that older versions of MySQL are still using a more
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/support/arrangements/mypl.html"> strict license</a>. 
See the documentation for that version for more information. If you need a 
commercial MySQL license, because the GPL license doesn't suit your
application, you can buy one at <a HREF="https://order.mysql.com/">https://order.mysql.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
For normal internal use, MySQL costs nothing.  You do not have
to pay us if you do not want to.

</P>
<P>
A license is required if:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You link a program, that is not free software, with code from the
MySQL server or clients that has the GPL copyright. This
happens for example when you use MySQL as an embedded server
in your applications or when you add not free extensions to the
MySQL server.  In this case your application/code would also
become GPL through the GPL license that acts as a virus.  By licensing
MySQL server from MySQL AB under a commercial
license you will avoid this problem.
See <a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html</a>.
<LI>

You have a commercial application that ONLY works with MySQL
and ships the application with the MySQL server.  This is
because we view this as linking even if it is done over the network.

<LI>

You have a distribution of MySQL and you don't provide the
source code for your copy of the MySQL server, as defined in
the GPL license.
</UL>

<P>
A license is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> required if:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

You do not need a license to include the client code in commercial
programs.  The client part of MySQL licensed with the
LGPL <CODE>GNU Library General Public License</CODE>.  The <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line
client includes code from the <CODE>readline</CODE> library that is under
the <CODE>GPL</CODE>.

<LI>

If your use of MySQL does not require a license, but you
like MySQL and want to encourage further development, you are
certainly welcome to purchase a license or MySQL support anyway.

<LI>

If you use MySQL in a commercial context such that you profit by 
its use, we ask that you further the development of MySQL by 
purchasing some level of support.  We feel that if MySQL helps 
your business, it is reasonable to ask that you help MySQL.  
(Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only using for 
free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're asking us to 
provide free support, too.)
</UL>

<P>
For circumstances under which a MySQL license is required, you
need a license per machine that runs the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  However,
a multiple-CPU machine counts as a single machine, and there is no
restriction on the number of MySQL servers that run on one
machine, or on the number of clients concurrently connected to a server
running on that machine!

</P>
<P>
If you have any questions as to whether or not a license is required for
your particular use of MySQL, please read this again and then
contact us.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Contact_information">1.3.4.2  Contact Information</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you require a MySQL license, the easiest way to pay for it
is to use the license form on MySQL's secure server at
<a HREF="https://order.mysql.com/">https://order.mysql.com/</a>.  Other forms of payment are
discussed in section <A HREF="manual.html#Payment_information">1.3.4.1  Payment information</A>.

user for his own or company usage.

</P>
<P>
However, if you use MySQL for something important to you, you may
want to help secure its development by purchasing licenses or a support
contract.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Copyright_changes" HREF="manual_toc.html#Copyright_changes">1.3.2.1  Copyright Changes</A></H4>

<P>
Version 3.22 of MySQL is still using a more strict license.  
See the documentation for that version for more information.

</P>
<P>
This section describes some situations illustrating whether or not you
must license the MySQL server.  Generally these examples
involve providing MySQL as an integral part of a product.

</P>
<P>
Note that a single MySQL license covers any number of CPUs and
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on a machine!  There is no artificial limit on the
number of clients that connect to the server in any way.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Products_that_use_MySQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#Products_that_use_MySQL">1.3.3.1  Selling Products that use MySQL</A></H4>

<P>
To determine whether or not you need a MySQL license when
selling your application, you should ask whether the proper functioning
of your application is dependent on the use of MySQL and
whether you include the MySQL server with your product.  There
are several cases to consider:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Does your application require MySQL to function properly?

<LI>

If your product requires MySQL, you need a license for any
machine that runs the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  For example, if you've
designed your application around MySQL, then you've really made
a commercial product that requires the engine, so you need a license.

<LI>

If your application does not require MySQL, you do not need to obtain
a license.  For example, if using MySQL just adds some new optional
features to your product (such as adding logging to a database if
MySQL is used rather than logging to a text file), it should
fall within normal use, and a license would not be required.

<LI>

In other words, you need a license if you sell a product designed
specifically for use with MySQL or that requires the
MySQL server to function at all.  This is true whether or not
you provide MySQL for your client as part of your product
distribution.

<LI>

It also depends on what you're doing for the client.  Do you plan to
provide your client with detailed instructions on installing
MySQL with your software?  Then your product may be contingent
on the use of MySQL; if so, you need to buy a license.  If you
are simply tying into a database that you expect already to have been
installed by the time your software is purchased, then you probably
don't need a license.

</UL>

</P>
<P>
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often host MySQL servers for
their customers.  With the GPL license this does not require a license.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, we do encourage people to use ISPs that have
MySQL support, as this will give them the confidence that if
they have some problem with their MySQL installation, their ISP
will be able to solve the problem for them (in some cases with the help
from the MySQL development team).

</P>
<P>
All ISPs that want to keep themselves up-to-date should subscribe
to our <CODE>announce</CODE> mailing list so that they can be aware of fatal issues
that may be relevant for their MySQL installations.

</P>
<P>
Note that if the ISP doesn't have a license for MySQL,
it should give its customers at least read access to the source of
the MySQL installation so that its customer can verify that
it is patched correctly.

<P>
If you use MySQL in conjunction with a Web server on Unix, you
don't have to pay for a license.

</P>
<P>
This is true even if you run a commercial Web server that uses

version yourself.  However, in this case we would like you to purchase
MySQL support, because MySQL is helping your enterprise.

For high volume (OEM) purchases, please contact
<a HREF="mailto:sales@mysql.com">sales@mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
For OEM purchases, you must act as the middle-man for eventual problems
or extension requests from your users.  We also require that OEM
customers have at least an extended e-mail support contract.  Note that
OEM licenses only apply for products where the user doesn't have direct
access to the MySQL server (embedded system).  In other words,
the MySQL server should only be used with the application
that was supplied you.

</P>
<P>
If you have a low-margin, high-volume product, you can always talk to us
about other terms (for example, a percent of the sale price).  If you do,
please be informative about your product, pricing, market, and any other
information that may be relevant.

</P>
<P>
A full-price license is not a support agreement and includes very minimal
support.  This means that we try to answer any relevant questions.  If the
answer is in the documentation, we will direct you to the appropriate
section.  If you have not purchased a license or support, we probably will
not answer at all.

</P>
<P>
If you discover what we consider a real bug, we are likely to fix it in
any case.  But if you pay for support we will notify you about the fix
status instead of just fixing it in a later release.

</P>
<P>
More comprehensive support is sold separately.  Descriptions of what each
level of support includes are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.3.5  Types of Commercial Support</A>.  Costs for the various

The following is true of all support options:

<UL>
<LI>

The support is per year.
<LI>

We will fix, or provide a reasonable workaround for any repeatable bug.
<LI>

We will give a reasonable effort to find and fix any other MySQL related bug.

The following is true for all support contracts except Basic email support:

For non-bug related things, like helping you optimize your queries or
your system, extending MySQL with new functionality, etc., we charge 200
EURO/hour, which is deducted from your support contract.  In other words,
if you have login support (2000 EURO), you can expect us to work up to
10 hours to help you with things like this.

<H4><A NAME="Basic_email_support" HREF="manual_toc.html#Basic_email_support">1.3.5.1  Basic E-mail Support</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>

</P>
<P>
Basic e-mail support is a very inexpensive support option and should be
thought of more as a way to support our development of MySQL
than as a real support option.  We at MySQL do give a lot of free
support in all the different MySQL lists, and the money we get from
basic e-mail support is largely used to make this possible.

</P>
<P>
At this support level, the MySQL mailing lists are the preferred
means of communication.  Questions normally should be mailed to the primary
mailing list (<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>) or one of the other regular
lists (for example, <a HREF="mailto:win32@lists.mysql.com">win32@lists.mysql.com</a> for Windows-related
MySQL questions), as someone else already may have experienced and
solved the problem you have.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Asking_questions">1.2.22.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs</A>.

</P>
<P>
However, by purchasing basic e-mail support, you also have access to the
support address <a HREF="mailto:mysql-support@mysql.com">mysql-support@mysql.com</a>, which is not available
as part of the minimal support that you get by purchasing a MySQL
license.  This means that for especially critical questions, you can 
cross-post your message to <a HREF="mailto:mysql-support@mysql.com">mysql-support@mysql.com</a>.  (If the 
message contains sensitive data, you should post only to 
<a HREF="mailto:mysql-support@mysql.com">mysql-support@mysql.com</a>.)

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>REMEMBER!</STRONG> to ALWAYS include your registration number and expiration 
date when you send a message to <a HREF="mailto:mysql-support@mysql.com">mysql-support@mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you have encountered a critical, repeatable bug, and follow
the rules outlined in the manual section of how to report bugs and send
it to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>, we promise to try to fix this as
soon as possible, regardless of your support level!  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

Basic e-mail support includes the following types of service:

<UL>
<LI>

If your question is already answered in the manual, we will inform you of the
correct section in which you can find the answer.  If the answer is not in
the manual, we will point you in the right direction to solve your problem.

<LI>

We guarantee a timely answer for your e-mail messages.  We can't guarantee
that we can solve any problem, but at least you will receive an answer if we
can contact you by e-mail.

<LI>

We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL from a
binary distribution on supported platforms.  This level of support does not
cover installing MySQL from a source distribution.  Supported
platforms are those for which MySQL is known to work.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.

<LI>

We will help you with bugs and missing features.  Any bugs that are found are
fixed for the next MySQL release.  If the bug is critical for
you, we will mail you a patch for it as soon the bug is fixed.  Critical
bugs always have the highest priority for us, and we ensure that they are
fixed as soon as possible.

<LI>

Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will be
taken into consideration.  By taking email support you have already
helped the further development of MySQL.  If you want to have
more input, upgrade to a higher level of support.

Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will
receive strong consideration.  Simple extensions that suit the basic
goals of MySQL are implemented in a matter of days.  By taking
extended e-mail support you have already helped the further development
of MySQL.

<LI>

Typical situations that are covered by extended e-mail support are:


<UL>
<LI>

We will answer and (within reason) solve questions that relate to possible
bugs in MySQL.  As soon as the bug is found and corrected, we
will mail a patch for it.

We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL from a
source or binary distribution on supported platforms.

<LI>

We will answer questions about missing features and offer hints how to work
around them.

<LI>

You are allowed to influence the priority of items on the MySQL

<UL>
<LI>

Your e-mail will be dealt with even before e-mail from extended e-mail

<LI>

Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will
be taken into very high consideration.  Realistic extensions that can be
implemented in a couple of hours and that suit the basic goals of
MySQL will be implemented as soon as possible.

<LI>

If you have a very specific problem, we can try to log in on your system
to solve the problem ``in place.''

<LI>

Like any database vendor, we can't guarantee that we can rescue any data from
crashed tables, but if the worst happens, we will help you rescue as much as
possible.  MySQL has proven itself very reliable, but anything is
possible due to circumstances beyond our control (for example, if your system
crashes or someone kills the server by executing a <CODE>kill -9</CODE> command).

<LI>

We will provide hints on optimizing your system and your queries.

<LI>

You are allowed to call a MySQL developer (in moderation) and
discuss your MySQL-related problems.  This option is however
only to be used as a last result during an emergency after we have
failed to grasp the total problem with email.  To make efficient
use of our time we need to first get all facts about the problem,
before talking on phone, to be able to work as efficiently as possible on
solving the problem.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Your e-mail has the highest possible priority.

<LI>

We will actively examine your system and help you optimize it and your
queries.  We may also optimize and/or extend MySQL to better
suit your needs.

<LI>

You may also request special extensions just for you.  For example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select MY_FUNC(col1,col2) from table;
</PRE>

<LI>

We will provide a binary distribution of all important MySQL
releases for your system, as long as we can get an account on a
similar system.  In the worst case, we may require access to your system
to be able to create a binary distribution.

<LI>

If you can provide accommodations and pay for traveler fares, you can
even get a MySQL developer to visit you and offer you help with
your troubles.  Extended login support entitles you to one personal
encounter per year, but we are always very flexible towards our
customers!  If the visit takes 16 hours or more, the first 8 hours is
without charge.  For the hours above 8 hours, you will be charged with a
rate that is at least 20 % less than our standard rates.

This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI SQL standards.
MySQL has many extensions to the ANSI SQL standards, and here you
will find out what they are, and how to use them.  You will also find 
information about functionality missing from MySQL, and how to work 
around some differences.  

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Extensions_to_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.4.1  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL includes some extensions that you probably will not find in
other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments
of the form <CODE>/*! ... */</CODE>.  In this case, MySQL will parse and
execute the code within the comment as it would any other MySQL
statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you add a version number after the <CODE>'!'</CODE>, the syntax will only be
executed if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the used
version number:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE (a int);
</PRE>

<P>
The above means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, then MySQL
will use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword.

</P>
<P>
MySQL extensions are listed below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The field types <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, and the
different <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types.

<LI>

The field attributes <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, and <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>.

<LI>

All string comparisons are case insensitive by default, with sort
ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by
default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with
the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute or use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast, which causes
comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the
MySQL server host.

<LI>

MySQL maps each database to a directory under the MySQL
data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database
directory.

This has a few implications:

<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>


<UL>

<LI>

Database names and table names are case sensitive in MySQL on
operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix
systems). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI>

Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit
(but may not consist solely of digits).

<LI>

You can use standard system commands to backup, rename, move, delete, and copy

To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
MySQL supports aliases for many functions. For example, all
string functions support both ANSI SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

<LI>

MySQL understands the <CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> operators to mean
logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL,
<CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> are synonyms, as are <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> and <CODE>AND</CODE>.
Because of this nice syntax, MySQL doesn't support
the ANSI SQL <CODE>||</CODE> operator for string concatenation; use
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> instead. Because <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> takes any number
of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the <CODE>||</CODE> operator to
MySQL.

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_DATABASE">6.5.1  <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
<LI>

The <CODE>%</CODE> operator is a synonym for <CODE>MOD()</CODE>.  That is,
<CODE>N % M</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>MOD(N,M)</CODE>.  <CODE>%</CODE> is supported
for C programmers and for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

<LI>

The <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE> ,<CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>,<CODE>&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>AND</CODE>, <CODE>OR</CODE>, or <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
operators may be used in column comparisons to the left of the
<CODE>FROM</CODE> in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col1=1 AND col2=2 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> extended regular expression
operators.

<LI>

<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> or <CODE>CHAR()</CODE> with one argument or more than two
arguments.  (In MySQL, these functions can take any number of

Use of <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> instead of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> + <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPLACE">6.4.7  <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>FLUSH</CODE>, <CODE>RESET</CODE> and <CODE>DO</CODE> statements.

In some cases, <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns are silently changed to <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
columns. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

The following functionality is missing in the current version of

<H4><A NAME="Missing_Sub-selects" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Sub-selects">1.4.4.1  Sub-selects</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL currently only supports sub selects of the form <CODE>INSERT
... SELECT ...</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE ... SELECT ...</CODE>. You can however use
the function <CODE>IN()</CODE> in other contexts.

</P>
<P>
In many cases you can rewrite the query without a sub-select:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
</PRE>

<P>
This can be re-written as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
The queries:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2 where table1.id=table2.id);
</PRE>

<P>
Can be rewritten as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id where table2.id IS NULL
</PRE>

<P>
For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in sub-selects).  For this situation there are two options
available until subqueries are supported by MySQL.

</P>
<P>
The first option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query to obtain the primary keys
for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (<CODE>DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1,
key2, ...)</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
The second option is to use interactive SQL to contruct a set of
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements automatically, using the MySQL
extension <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> (in lieu of the standard <CODE>||</CODE> operator).
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', tab1.pkid, ';')
  FROM tab1, tab2
 WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;
</PRE>

<P>
You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a
second instance of the interpreter:

</P>

<PRE>
prompt&#62; mysql --skip-column-names mydb &#60; myscript.sql | mysql mydb
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL 4.0 supports multi-table deletes that can be used to efficiently
delete rows based on information from one table or even from many tables
at the same time.

<A NAME="IDX142"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't yet support the Oracle SQL extension:
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...</CODE>.  MySQL supports instead the
ANSI SQL syntax <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>, which is basically
the same thing. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_SELECT">6.4.2.1  <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<PRE>
INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID FROM tblTemp1 WHERE

Alternatively, you can use <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE...</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE

<H4><A NAME="Missing_Transactions" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Transactions">1.4.4.3  Transactions</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>

</P>
<P>
As MySQL does nowadays support transactions, the following
discussion is only valid if you are only using the non-transaction-safe
table types. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The question is often asked, by the curious and the critical, ``Why is
MySQL not a transactional database?'' or ``Why does MySQL
not support transactions?''

</P>
<P>
MySQL has made a conscious decision to support another paradigm
for data integrity, ``atomic operations.'' It is our thinking and
experience that atomic operations offer equal or even better integrity
with much better performance. We, nonetheless, appreciate and understand
the transactional database paradigm and plan, within the next few releases,
to introduce transaction-safe tables on a per table basis. We will be
giving our users the possibility to decide if they need the speed of
atomic operations or if they need to use transactional features in their
applications.

</P>
<P>
How does one use the features of MySQL to maintain rigorous integrity
and how do these features compare with the transactional paradigm?

</P>
<P>
First, in the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written
in a way that is dependent on the calling of ``rollback'' instead of
``commit'' in critical situations, then transactions are more
convenient. Moreover, transactions ensure that unfinished updates or
corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is
given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is
saved.

</P>
<P>
MySQL, in almost all cases, allows you to solve for potential
problems by including simple checks before updates and by running simple
scripts that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically
repair or warn if such occurs. Note that just by using the
MySQL log or even adding one extra log, one can normally fix
tables perfectly with no data integrity loss.

</P>
<P>
Moreover, fatal transactional updates can be rewritten to be
atomic. In fact,we will go so far as to say that all integrity problems
that transactions solve can be done with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or atomic updates,
ensuring that you never will get an automatic abort from the database,
which is a common problem with transactional databases.

</P>
<P>
Not even transactions can prevent all loss if the server goes down.  In
such cases even a transactional system can lose data.  The difference
between different systems lies in just how small the time-lap is where
they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only ``secure
enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of transactional
databases, is reported to sometimes lose data in such situations.

</P>
<P>
To be safe with MySQL, you only need to have backups and have
the update logging turned on.  With this you can recover from any
situation that you could with any transactional database.  It is, of
course, always good to have backups, independent of which database you
use.

</P>
<P>
The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they can
code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary, and they
may have to do a little more work with MySQL to either think
differently or write more. If you are new to the atomic operations
paradigm, or more familiar or more comfortable with transactions, do not
jump to the conclusion that MySQL has not addressed these
issues. Reliability and integrity are foremost in our minds.  Recent
estimates indicate that there are more than 1,000,000 <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers
currently running, many of which are in production environments.  We
hear very, very seldom from our users that they have lost any data, and
in almost all of those cases user error is involved. This is, in our
opinion, the best proof of MySQL's stability and reliability.

</P>
<P>
Lastly, in situations where integrity is of highest importance,
MySQL's current features allow for transaction-level or better
reliability and integrity. If you lock tables with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, all
updates will stall until any integrity checks are made.  If you only obtain
a read lock (as opposed to a write lock), then reads and inserts are
still allowed to happen.  The new inserted records will not be seen by
any of the clients that have a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock until they release their read
locks.  With <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> you can queue inserts into a local queue,
until the locks are released, without having the client wait for the insert
to complete. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only means
that you can be sure that while each specific update is running, no other
user can interfere with it, and there will never be an automatic
rollback (which can happen on transaction based systems if you are not
very careful).  MySQL also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.  You can find some example of how to write atomic updates
in the commit-rollback section. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Commit-rollback">1.4.6  How to Cope Without <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>/<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
We have thought quite a bit about integrity and performance, and we
believe that our atomic operations paradigm allows for both high
reliability and extremely high performance, on the order of three to
five times the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned of
transactional databases. We didn't leave out transactions because they
are hard to do. The main reason we went with atomic operations as
opposed to transactions is that by doing this we could apply many speed
optimizations that would not otherwise have been possible.

</P>
<P>
Many of our users who have speed foremost in their minds are not at all
concerned about transactions. For them transactions are not an
issue. For those of our users who are concerned with or have wondered
about transactions vis-a-vis MySQL, there is a ``MySQL
way'' as we have outlined above.  For those where safety is more
important than speed, we recommend them to use the <CODE>BDB</CODE>,
or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables for all their critical data. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
One final note: We are currently working on a safe replication schema
that we believe to be better than any commercial replication system we
know of. This system will work most reliably under the atomic
operations, non-transactional, paradigm. Stay tuned.

<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>

</P>
<P>
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored
in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing
the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure. This provides better
performance because the query has to be parsed only once, and less information
needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also raise the
conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server.

</P>
<P>
A trigger is a stored procedure that is invoked when a particular event
occurs.  For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered
each time a record is deleted from a transaction table and that automatically
deletes the corresponding customer from a customer table when all his
transactions are deleted.

</P>
<P>
The planned update language will be able to
handle stored procedures, but without triggers. Triggers usually slow
down everything, even queries for which they are not needed.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>

</P>
<P>
Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used
mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If
you want to get results from multiple tables from a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, you do this by joining tables:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * from table1,table2 where table1.id = table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#example-Foreign_keys">3.5.6  Using Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax in MySQL exists only for compatibility
with other SQL vendors' <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> commands; it doesn't do
anything.  The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax without <CODE>ON DELETE ...</CODE> is
mostly used for documentation purposes. Some ODBC applications may use this
to produce automatic <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses, but this is usually easy to
override. <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> is sometimes used as a constraint check, but
this check is unnecessary in practice if rows are inserted into the tables in
the right order. MySQL only supports these clauses because some
applications require them to exist (regardless of whether or not they
work).

</P>
<P>
In MySQL, you can work around the problem of <CODE>ON DELETE
...</CODE> not being implemented by adding the appropriate <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement to
an application when you delete records from a table that has a foreign key.
In practice this is as quick (in some cases quicker) and much more portable
than using foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
In the near future we will extend the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> implementation so
that at least the information will be saved in the table specification file
and may be retrieved by <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and ODBC. At a later stage we will
implement the foreign key constraints for application that can't easily be
coded to avoid them.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are so many problems with foreign key constraints that we don't
know where to start:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Foreign key constraints make life very complicated, because the foreign
key definitions must be stored in a database and implementing them would
destroy the whole ``nice approach'' of using files that can be moved,
copied, and removed.

<LI>

The speed impact is terrible for <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements, and in this case almost all <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraint
checks are useless because you usually insert records in the right
tables in the right order, anyway.

<LI>

There is also a need to hold locks on many more tables when updating one
table, because the side effects can cascade through the entire database. It's
MUCH faster to delete records from one table first and subsequently delete
them from the other tables.

<LI>

You can no longer restore a table by doing a full delete from the table
and then restoring all records (from a new source or from a backup).

<LI>

If you use foreign key constraints you can't dump and restore tables
unless you do so in a very specific order.

<LI>

It's very easy to do ``allowed'' circular definitions that make the
tables impossible to re-create each table with a single create statement,
even if the definition works and is usable.

<LI>

It's very easy to overlook <CODE>FOREIGN KEY ... ON DELETE</CODE> rules when
one codes an application. It's not unusual that one loses a lot of
important information just because a wrong or misused <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE> rule.
</UL>

<P>
The only nice aspect of <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> is that it gives ODBC and some
other client programs the ability to see how a table is connected and to use
this to show connection diagrams and to help in building applications.

</P>
<P>
MySQL will soon store <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> definitions so that a
client can ask for and receive an answer about how the original
connection was made. The current <TT>`.frm'</TT> file format does not have
any place for it.  At a later stage we will implement the foreign key
constraints for application that can't easily be coded to avoid them.

<H4><A NAME="Missing_Views" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_Views">1.4.4.7  Views</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't yet support views, but we plan to implement these
to about 4.1.

</P>
<P>
Views are mostly useful for letting users access a set of relations as one
table (in read-only mode).  Many SQL databases don't allow one to update
any rows in a view, but you have to do the updates in the separate tables.

</P>
<P>
As MySQL is mostly used in applications and on web system where
the application writer has full control on the database usage, most of
our users haven't regarded views to be very important. (At least no one
has been interested enough in this to be prepared to finance the
implementation of views).

</P>
<P>
One doesn't need views in MySQL to restrict access to columns
as MySQL has a very sophisticated privilege
system. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

<H4><A NAME="Missing_comments" HREF="manual_toc.html#Missing_comments">1.4.4.8  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some other SQL databases use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> to start comments. MySQL
has <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the start comment character, even if the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
command-line tool removes all lines that start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.
You can also use the C comment style <CODE>/* this is a comment */</CODE> with
MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Comments">6.1.5  Comment Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Version 3.23.3 and above supports the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comment style
only if the comment is followed by a space.  This is because this
degenerate comment style has caused many problems with automatically
generated SQL queries that have used something like the following code,
where we automatically insert the value of the payment for
<CODE>!payment!</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!
</PRE>

<P>
What do you think will happen when the value of <CODE>payment</CODE> is negative?

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>1--1</CODE> is legal in SQL, we think it is terrible that
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP> means start comment.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23 you can, however, use:
<CODE>1-- This is a comment</CODE>

</P>
<P>
The following discussion only concerns you if you are running a MySQL
version earlier than Version 3.23:

</P>
<P>
If you have a SQL program in a text file that contains <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comments
you should use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
         | mysql database
</PRE>

<P>
instead of the usual:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments to <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> comments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
</PRE>

<P>
Change them back with this command:

</P>

The following mostly applies only for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, and
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables. If you only use transaction-safe tables (<CODE>BDB</CODE>,
or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables) in an an update, you can do
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> also with MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The problem with handling <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>-<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> efficiently with
the above table types would require a completely different table layout
than MySQL uses today.  The table type would also need extra
threads that do automatic cleanups on the tables, and the disk usage
would be much higher. This would make these table types about 2-4 times
slower than they are today.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, we prefer implementing the SQL server language (something
like stored procedures). With this you would very seldom really need
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE>-<CODE>ROLLBACK.</CODE> This would also give much better performance.

</P>
<P>
Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, and you don't need cursors when you can update records
on the fly.

</P>
<P>
We at TcX had a greater need for a real fast database than a 100%
general database. Whenever we find a way to implement these features without
any speed loss, we will probably do it. For the moment, there are many more
important things to do. Check the TODO for how we prioritize things at
the moment. (Customers with higher levels of support can alter this, so
things may be reprioritized.)

</P>
<P>
The current problem is actually <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>. Without
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can do any kind of <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> action with
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>. To support <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> with the above table
types, MySQL would have to be changed to store all old records
that were updated and revert everything back to the starting point if
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> was issued. For simple cases, this isn't that hard to do
(the current <CODE>isamlog</CODE> could be used for this purpose), but it
would be much more difficult to implement <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> for
<CODE>ALTER/DROP/CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To avoid using <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can use the following strategy:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOCK TABLES ...</CODE> to lock all the tables you want to access.
<LI>

Test conditions.
<LI>

Update if everything is okay.
<LI>

Use <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> to release your locks.
</OL>

<P>
This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with possible
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>s, although not always. The only situation this solution
doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the middle of an
update. In this case, all locks will be released but some of the updates may
not have been executed.

</P>
<P>
You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following techniques:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Modify fields relative to their current value.

<LI>Update only those fields that actually have changed.

</UL>

<P>
For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of
the changed data, or data that depend on the changed data, has changed
compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: "Some of the data you have changed
have been changed by another user". Then we show the old row versus the new
row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record
he should use.

</P>
<P>
This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually
even better, because we only update some of the columns, using values that
are relative to their current values.  This means that typical <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements look something like these:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+'relative change';

UPDATE customer
  SET
    customer_date='current_date',
    address='new address',
    phone='new phone',
    money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us+'new_money'
  WHERE
    customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';
</PRE>

<P>
As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client has
changed the values in the <CODE>pay_back</CODE> or <CODE>money_he_owes_us</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
In many cases, users have wanted <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> and/or <CODE>LOCK
TABLES</CODE> for the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables. This
can be handled much more efficiently by using an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column
and either the SQL function <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> or the C API function
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
At MySQL AB, we have never had any need for row-level locking
because we have always been able to code around it. Some cases really need
row locking, but they are very few. If you want row-level locking, you
can use a flag column in the table and do something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was
found and <CODE>row_flag</CODE> wasn't already 1 in the original row.

</P>
<P>
You can think of it as MySQL changed the above query to:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID and row_flag &#60;&#62; 1;
</PRE>

The following problems are known and have a very high priority to get
fixed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> on a BDB table may in some case make the table
unusable until one has restarted <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  When this happens you will
see errors like the following in the MySQL error file:


<PRE>
001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log
</PRE>

<LI>

Don't execute <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table on which you are
running not completed multi-statement transactions. (The transaction
will probably be ignored).

<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> may
cause problems on tables for which you are using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.

<LI>

Doing a <CODE>LOCK TABLE ..</CODE> and <CODE>FLUSH TABLES ..</CODE> doesn't
guarantee that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the
table.

<LI>

BDB tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many BDB tables in a
database, it will take a long time to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client on the
database if you are not using the <CODE>-A</CODE> option or if you are using
<CODE>rehash</CODE>. This is especially notable when you have a big table
cache.

<LI>

Th current replication protocol cannot deal with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>
and line terminator characters of more than 1 character.
</UL>

<P>
The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For the moment <CODE>MATCH</CODE> only works with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.

<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE>, one can't use translated
characters in database, table and column names.

<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables

<LI>

You cannot build in another directory when using
MIT-pthreads. Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not
likely to fix this.

<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> values can't ``reliably'' be used in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>. Only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE>
bytes (default 1024) are used when comparing <CODE>BLOB</CODE>bs in these cases.
This can be changed with the <CODE>-O max_sort_length</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. A workaround for most cases is to use a substring:
<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<LI>

Calculation is done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> (both are
normally 64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one
gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>
precision, <CODE>IF</CODE>, and <CODE>ELT()</CODE> with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
precision and the rest with <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> precision.  One should try to
avoid using bigger unsigned long long values than 63 bits
(9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit fields!

<LI>

All string columns, except <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, automatically
have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> types this
is okay, and may be regarded as a feature according to ANSI SQL92. The bug is
that in MySQL, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are treated the same way.

<LI>

You can only have up to 255 <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns in one table.

<LI>

<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> re-directs all messages from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> log.  One problem with this is that if you execute
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> to close and reopen the log,
<CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE> are still redirected to the old log.
If you use <CODE>--log</CODE> extensively, you should edit <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to
log to <TT>`'hostname'.err'</TT> instead of <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT> so you can
easily reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and
executing <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

<LI>

In the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, columns are updated from left to right.  If 
you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value instead of the
original value. For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;
</PRE>

This will update <CODE>KEY</CODE> with <CODE>2</CODE> instead of with <CODE>1</CODE>.

<LI>

You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
For example, the following doesn't work.


<PRE>
select * from temporary_table, temporary_table as t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>RENAME</CODE> doesn't work with <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> tables.

<LI>

The optimizer may handle <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> differently if you are using
'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are
counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in
normal queries hidden columns doesn't participate in the <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never compare
the hidden columns when executing <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>

An example of this is:


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id
DESC;
</PRE>

and


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id, FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9 AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;
</PRE>

In the second case you may in MySQL 3.23.x get two identical rows
in the result set (because the hidden 'id' column may differ).

Note that the this only happens for queries where you don't have the
ORDER BY columns in the result, something that is you are not allowed
to do in ANSI SQL.

<LI>

Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that doesn't
support transactions (and thus can't <CODE>rollback</CODE> data) some things
behaves a little different in MySQL than in other SQL servers:

Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that don't
support transactions, and thus can't <CODE>rollback</CODE> data, some things
behave a little differently in MySQL than in other SQL servers.
This is just to ensure that MySQL never need to do a rollback
for a SQL command.  This may be a little awkward at times as column
values must be checked in the application, but this will actually give
you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL to do some
optimizations that otherwise would be very hard to do.

If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL will, instead of
doing a rollback, store the <CODE>best possible value</CODE> in the column:


<UL>
<LI>

If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical column,
MySQL will instead store the smallest or biggest possible value in
the column.

<LI>

If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number into a
numerical column, MySQL will store 0 into it.

<LI>

If you try to store <CODE>NULL</CODE> into a column that doesn't take
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, MySQL will store 0 or <CODE>''</CODE> (empty
string) in it instead. (This behavior can, however, be changed with the
-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compile option).

<LI>

MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into
<CODE>DATE</CODE> and <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns. (Like 2000-02-31 or 2000-02-00).
If the date is totally wrong, MySQL will store the special
0000-00-00 date value in the column.

<LI>

If you set an <CODE>enum</CODE> to an unsupported value, it will be set to
the error value 'empty string', with numeric value 0.
</UL>

<LI>

If you execute a <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> on a query that returns an empty set,
in some cases the <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> will not transform the columns.

<LI>

Creation of a table of type <CODE>MERGE</CODE> doesn't check if the underlying
tables are of compatible types.

<LI>

MySQL can't yet handle <CODE>NaN</CODE>, <CODE>-Inf</CODE> and <CODE>Inf</CODE>
values in double. Using these will cause problems when trying to export
and import data. We should as an intermediate solution change <CODE>NaN</CODE> to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (if possible) and <CODE>-Inf</CODE> and <CODE>Inf</CODE> to the
Minimum respective maximum possible <CODE>double</CODE> value.

<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> on negative numbers are treated as big positive numbers.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to first add an <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index to a
table used in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and then use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
add a normal index on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old not-unique key in the
table. This is because <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> puts <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys before
normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
</UL>

<P>
The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can get a hung thread if you do a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is
one among many tables that is locked with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

In the following case you can get a core dump:


<UL>
<LI>

Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.

<LI>

<CODE>LOCK table</CODE> with <CODE>WRITE</CODE>

<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>
</UL>

<LI>

Before MySQL Version 3.23.2 an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that updated a key with
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> on the same key may have failed because the key was used to
search for records and the same row may have been found multiple times:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY &#62; 100;
</PRE>

A workaround is to use:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 &#62; 100;
</PRE>

This will work because MySQL will not use index on expressions in
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Before MySQL Version 3.23, all numeric types where treated as fixed-point
fields. That means you had to specify how many decimals a floating-point
field shall have. All results were returned with the correct number of
decimals.

<H3><A NAME="Compare_mSQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compare_mSQL">1.5.1  How MySQL Compares to <CODE>mSQL</CODE></A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Performance</STRONG>
<DD>
For a true comparison of speed, consult the growing MySQL benchmark
suite. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

Because there is no thread creation overhead, a small parser, few features, and
simple security, <CODE>mSQL</CODE> should be quicker at:


<UL>
<LI>

Tests that perform repeated connects and disconnects, running a very simple
query during each connection.

<LI>

<CODE>INSERT</CODE> operations into very simple tables with few columns and keys.

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> on something that isn't an index. (A table scan is very
easy.)
</UL>

Because these operations are so simple, it is hard to be better at them when
you have a higher startup overhead. After the connection is established,
MySQL should perform much better.

On the other hand, MySQL is much faster than <CODE>mSQL</CODE> (and
most other SQL implementations) on the following:


<UL>
<LI>

Complex <CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations.

<LI>

Retrieving large results (MySQL has a better, faster, and safer
protocol).

<LI>

Tables with variable-length strings, because MySQL has more efficient
handling and can have indexes on <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.

<LI>

Handling tables with many columns.

<LI>

Handling tables with large record lengths.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> with many expressions.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> on large tables.

<LI>

Handling many connections at the same time. MySQL is fully
multi-threaded. Each connection has its own thread, which means that
no thread has to wait for another (unless a thread is modifying
a table another thread wants to access). In <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, once one connection
is established, all others must wait until the first has finished, regardless
of whether the connection is running a query that is short or long. When the
first connection terminates, the next can be served, while all the others wait
again, etc.

<LI>

Joins.
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> can become pathologically slow if you change the order of tables
in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>. In the benchmark suite, a time more than 15000 times
slower than MySQL was seen.  This is due to <CODE>mSQL</CODE>'s lack of a
join optimizer to order tables in the optimal order. However, if you put the
tables in exactly the right order in <CODE>mSQL</CODE>2 and the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is
simple and uses index columns, the join will be relatively fast!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>.

<LI>

Using <CODE>TEXT</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns.
</UL>

<DT><STRONG>SQL Features</STRONG>
<DD>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> and <CODE>HAVING</CODE>.

<CODE>mSQL</CODE> does not support <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> at all.
MySQL supports a full <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with both <CODE>HAVING</CODE> and
the following functions: <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>AVG()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>,
<CODE>MAX()</CODE>, <CODE>SUM()</CODE>, and <CODE>STD()</CODE>.  <CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is optimized to
return very quickly if the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves from one table, no other
columns are retrieved, and there is no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX()</CODE> may take string arguments.

<LI><CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> with calculations.

MySQL can do calculations in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE SET x=x*10+y WHERE x&#60;20;
</PRE>

<LI>Aliasing.

MySQL has column aliasing.

<LI>Qualifying column names.

In MySQL, if a column name is unique among the tables used in a
query, you do not have to use the full qualifier.

<LI><CODE>SELECT</CODE> with functions.

MySQL has many functions (too many to list here; see section <A HREF="manual.html#Functions">6.3  Functions for Use in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>).

</UL>

<DT><STRONG>Disk Space Efficiency</STRONG>
<DD>
That is, how small can you make your tables?

MySQL has very precise types, so you can create tables that take
very little space. An example of a useful MySQL datatype is the
<CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE> that is 3 bytes long. If you have 100,000,000 records,
saving even one byte per record is very important.

<CODE>mSQL2</CODE> has a more limited set of column types, so it is
more difficult to get small tables.

<DT><STRONG>Stability</STRONG>
<DD>
This is harder to judge objectively. For a discussion of MySQL
stability, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Stability">1.1.7  How Stable Is MySQL?</A>.

We have no experience with <CODE>mSQL</CODE> stability, so we cannot say
anything about that.

<DT><STRONG>Price</STRONG>
<DD>
Another important issue is the license. MySQL has a
more flexible license than <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, and is also less expensive than
<CODE>mSQL</CODE>.  Whichever product you choose to use, remember to at least
consider paying for a license or e-mail support.  (You are required to get
a license if you include MySQL with a product that you sell,
of course.)

<DT><STRONG>Perl Interfaces</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL has basically the same interfaces to Perl as <CODE>mSQL</CODE> with
some added features.

<DT><STRONG>JDBC (Java)</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL currently has a lot of different JDBC drivers:


<UL>
<LI>

The mm driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Mark Matthews
<a HREF="mailto:mmatthew@ecn.purdue.edu">mmatthew@ecn.purdue.edu</a>.  This is released under the LGPL.

<LI>

The Resin driver. This is a commercial JDBC driver released under open
source.  <a HREF="http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp">http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp</a>

<LI>

The gwe driver: A Java interface by GWE technologies (not supported anymore).

<LI>

The jms driver: An improved gwe driver by Xiaokun Kelvin ZHU
<a HREF="mailto:X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk">X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk</a> (not supported anymore).

<LI>

The twz driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Terrence W. Zellers
<a HREF="mailto:zellert@voicenet.com">zellert@voicenet.com</a>.  This is commercial but is free for private
and educational use (not supported anymore).
</UL>

The recommended driver is the mm driver. The Resin driver may also be
good (at least the benchmarks looks good), but we haven't received that much
information about this yet.

We know that <CODE>mSQL</CODE> has a JDBC driver, but we have too little experience
with it to compare.

<DT><STRONG>Rate of Development</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL has a very small team of developers, but we are quite
used to coding C and C++ very rapidly. Because threads, functions,
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, and so on are still not implemented in <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, it
has a lot of catching up to do. To get some perspective on this, you
can view the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> <TT>`HISTORY'</TT> file for the last year and
compare it with the News section of the MySQL Reference Manual
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#News">F  MySQL change history</A>). It should be pretty obvious which one has developed
most rapidly.

<DT><STRONG>Utility Programs</STRONG>
<DD>
Both <CODE>mSQL</CODE> and MySQL have many interesting third-party
tools. Because it is very easy to port upward (from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
MySQL), almost all the interesting applications that are available for
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> are also available for MySQL.

MySQL comes with a simple <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE> program that fixes
differences in spelling between <CODE>mSQL</CODE> and MySQL for the
most-used C API functions.
For example, it changes instances of <CODE>msqlConnect()</CODE> to
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>. Converting a client program from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
MySQL usually takes a couple of minutes.
</DL>



<H4><A NAME="Using_mSQL_tools" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_mSQL_tools">1.5.1.1  How to Convert <CODE>mSQL</CODE> Tools for MySQL</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>

</P>
<P>
According to our experience, it would just take a few hours to convert tools
such as <CODE>msql-tcl</CODE> and <CODE>msqljava</CODE> that use the
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> C API so that they work with the MySQL C API.

</P>
<P>
The conversion procedure is:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Run the shell script <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE> on the source. This requires the
<CODE>replace</CODE> program, which is distributed with MySQL.

<LI>

Compile.

<LI>

Fix all compiler errors.
</OL>

<P>
Differences between the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> C API and the MySQL C API are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL uses a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a connection type (<CODE>mSQL</CODE>
uses an <CODE>int</CODE>).

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> takes a pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a
parameter.  It is easy to define one globally or to use <CODE>malloc()</CODE> to get
one.  <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> also takes two parameters for specifying the 
user and password.  You may set these to <CODE>NULL, NULL</CODE> for default use.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> takes the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a parameter. Just add
the parameter to your old <CODE>msql_error()</CODE> code if you are porting old code.

<LI>

MySQL returns an error number and a text error message for all
errors. <CODE>mSQL</CODE> returns only a text error message.

<LI>

Some incompatibilities exist as a result of MySQL supporting
multiple connections to the server from the same process.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Protocol_differences" HREF="manual_toc.html#Protocol_differences">1.5.1.2  How <CODE>mSQL</CODE> and MySQL Client/Server Communications Protocols Differ</A></H4>

<A NAME="IDX173"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are enough differences that it is impossible (or at least not easy)
to support both.

</P>
<P>
The most significant ways in which the MySQL protocol differs
from the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> protocol are listed below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A message buffer may contain many result rows.

<LI>

The message buffers are dynamically enlarged if the query or the
result is bigger than the current buffer, up to a configurable server and
client limit.

<LI>

All packets are numbered to catch duplicated or missing packets.

<LI>

All column values are sent in ASCII. The lengths of columns and rows are sent
in packed binary coding (1, 2, or 3 bytes).

<LI>

MySQL can read in the result unbuffered (without having to store the
full set in the client).

<LI>

If a single read/write takes more than 30 seconds, the server closes
the connection.

<LI>

If a connection is idle for 8 hours, the server closes the connection.

<H3><A NAME="Compare_PostgreSQL" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compare_PostgreSQL">1.5.2  How MySQL Compares to PostgreSQL</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>

</P>
<P>
When reading the following, please note that both products are continually
evolving.  We at MySQL AB and the PostgreSQL developers are both working
on making our respective database as good as possible, so we are both a 
serious choice to any commercial database.

</P>
<P>
The following comparison is made by us at MySQL AB.  We have tried to be
as accurate and fair as possible, but because we don't have a full
knowledge of all PostgreSQL features while we know MySQL througly, we
may have got some things wrong.  We will however correct these when they
come to our attention.

</P>
<P>
We would first like to note that PostgreSQL and MySQL are both widely used
products, but with different design goals, even if we are both striving to
be ANSI SQL compatible.  This means that for some applications MySQL is 
more suited, while for others PostgreSQL is more suited.  When choosing 
which database to use, you should first check if the database's feature set
satisfies your application.  If you need raw speed, MySQL is probably your
best choice.  If you need some of the extra features that only PostgreSQL
can offer, you should use <CODE>PostgreSQL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>

</P>



<H4><A NAME="MySQL-PostgreSQL_goals" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL-PostgreSQL_goals">1.5.2.1  MySQL and PostgreSQL development strategies</A></H4>

<P>
When adding things to MySQL we take pride to do an optimal, definite
solution.  The code should be so good that we shouldn't have any need to
change it in the foreseeable future.  We also do not like to sacrifice
speed for features but instead will do our utmost to find a solution
that will give maximal throughput.  This means that development will take
a little longer, but the end result will be well worth this.  This kind
of development is only possible because all server code are checked by
one of a few (currently two) persons before it's included in the
MySQL server.

</P>
<P>
We at MySQL AB believe in frequent releases to be able to push out new
features quickly to our users.  Because of this we do a new small release
about every three weeks, and a major branch every year.  All releases are
throughly tested with our testing tools on a lot of different platforms.

</P>
<P>
PostgreSQL is based on a kernel with lots of contributors. In this setup
it makes sense to prioritize adding a lot of new features, instead of
implementing them optimally, because one can always optimize things
later if there arises a need for this.

</P>
<P>
Another big difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL is that
nearly all of the code in the MySQL server are coded by developers that
are employed by MySQL AB and are still working on the server code. The
exceptions are the transaction engines, and the regexp library.

</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast to the PostgreSQL code where the majority of
the code is coded by a big group of people with different backgrounds.
It was only recently that the PostgreSQL developers announced that their
current developer group had finally had time to take a look at all
the code in the current PostgreSQL release.

</P>
<P>
Both of the above development methods has it's own merits and drawbacks.
We here at MySQL AB think of course that our model is better because our
model gives better code consistency, more optimal and reusable code, and
in our opinion, fewer bugs.  Because we are the authors of the MySQL server
code, we are better able to coordinate new features and releases.

one can detect automatically with a program.  Note however that a lot of

<P>
MySQL offers the following advantages over PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>MySQL</CODE> is generally much faster than PostgreSQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL-PostgreSQL_benchmarks">1.5.2.3  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL</A>.

<LI>

MySQL has a much larger user base than PostgreSQL, therefor the
code is more tested and has historically been more stable than
PostgreSQL.  MySQL is the much more used in production
environments than PostgreSQL, mostly thanks to that MySQL AB,
formerly TCX DataKonsult AB, has provided top quality commercial support
for MySQL from the day it was released, whereas until recently
PostgreSQL was unsupported.

<LI>

MySQL works better on Windows than PostgreSQL does.  MySQL runs as a
native Windows application (a service on NT/Win2000/WinXP), while
PostgreSQL is run under the cygwin emulation.  We have heard that
PostgreSQL is not yet that stable on Windows but we haven't been able to
verify this ourselves.

<LI>

MySQL has more APIs to other languages and is supported by more
existing programs than PostgreSQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Contrib">D  Contributed Programs</A>.

<LI>

MySQL works on 24/7 heavy duty systems.  In most circumstances
you never have to run any cleanups on MySQL.  PostgreSQL doesn't
yet support 24/7 systems because you have to run <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE>
once in a while to reclaim space from <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
commands and to perform statistics analyzes that are critical to get
good performance with PostgreSQL.  <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> is also needed after
adding a lot of new rows to a table.  On a busy system with lots of changes,
<CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> must be run very frequently, in the worst cases even 
many times a day.  During the <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> run, which may take hours 
if the database is big, the database is from a production standpoint,
practically dead.  The PostgreSQL team has fixing this on their TODO,
but we assume that this is not an easy thing to fix permanently.

<LI>

A working, tested replication feature used by sites like:

<UL>
<LI>Yahoo Finance (<a HREF="http://finance.yahoo.com">http://finance.yahoo.com</a>)

<LI>Mobile.de (<a HREF="http://www.mobile.de/">http://www.mobile.de/</a>)

<LI>Slashdot (<a HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</a>)

</UL>

<LI>

Included in the MySQL distribution are two different testing suites, 
<TT>`mysql-test-run'</TT> and 
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php">crash-me</a>, as well
as a benchmark suite.  The test system is actively updated with code to
test each new feature and almost all repeatable bugs that have come to
our attention.  We test MySQL with these on a lot of platforms before
every release.  These tests are more sophisticated than anything we have 
seen from PostgreSQL, and they ensures that the MySQL is kept to a high
standard.

<LI>

There are far more books in print about MySQL than about PostgreSQL.
O'Reilly, Sams, Que, and New Riders are all major publishers with books
about MySQL.  All MySQL features are also documented in the MySQL on-line
manual, because when a new feature is implemented, the MySQL developers 
are required to document it before it's included in the source.

<LI>

MySQL supports more of the standard ODBC functions than <CODE>PostgreSQL</CODE>.

<LI>

MySQL has a much more sophisticated <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

MySQL has support for tables without transactions for applications that 
need all speed they can get. The tables may be memory based, <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
tables or disk based <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

MySQL has support for two different table handlers that support
transactions, <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.  Because every 
transaction engine performs differently under different conditions, this 
gives the application writer more options to find an optimal solution for
his or her setup.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables gives you a unique way to instantly make a view over
a set of identical tables and use these as one.  This is perfect for
systems where you have log files that you order for example by month.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  MERGE Tables</A>.

<LI>

The option to compress read-only tables, but still have direct access to
the rows in the table, gives you better performance by minimizing disk
reads.  This is very useful when you are archiving things.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

<LI>

MySQL has internal support for fulltext search. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.

<LI>

You can access many databases from the same connection (depending of course
on your privileges).

<LI>

MySQL is coded from the start to be multi-threaded while PostgreSQL uses
processes.  Context switching and access to common storage areas is much 
faster between threads than between separate processes, this gives MySQL
a big speed advantage in multi-user applications and also makes it easier
for MySQL to take full advantage of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems.

<LI>

MySQL has a much more sophisticated privilege system than PostgreSQL.  
While PostgreSQL only supports <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, and
<CODE>UPDATE/DELETE</CODE> grants per user on a database or a table, MySQL allows
you to define a full set of different privileges on database, table and 
column level.  MySQL also allows you to specify the privilege on host and 
user combinations.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

MySQL supports a compressed client/server protocol which improves 
performance over slow links.

<LI>

MySQL employs a ``table handler'' concept, and is the only relational 
database we know of built around this concept.  This allows different 
low-level table types to be swapped into the SQL engine, and each table 
type can be optimized for different performance characteristics.

<LI>

All MySQL table types (except <STRONG>InnoDB</STRONG>) are implemented as files
(one table per file), which makes it really easy to backup, move, delete
and even symlink databases and tables, even when the server is down.

<LI>

Tools to repair and optimize <STRONG>MyISAM</STRONG> tables (the most common
MySQL table type).  A repair tool is only needed when a physical corruption
of a data file happens, usually from a hardware failure.  It allows a 
majority of the data to be recovered.

<LI>

Upgrading MySQL is painless.  When you are upgrading MySQL, you don't need
to dump/restore your data, as you have to do with most PostgreSQL upgrades.
</UL>

<P>
Drawbacks with MySQL compared to PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The transaction support in MySQL is not yet as well tested as PostgreSQL's
system.

<LI>

Because MySQL uses threads, which are not yet flawless on many OSes, one
must either use binaries from <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads">http://www.mysql.com/downloads</a>, or
carefully follow our instructions on
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/I/n/Installing_source.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/I/n/Installing_source.html</a> to get an
optimal binary that works in all cases.

<LI>

Table locking, as used by the non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, is
in many cases faster than page locks, row locks or versioning.  The
drawback however is that if one doesn't take into account how table
locks work, a single long-running query can block a table for updates
for a long time. This can usable be avoided when designing the
application.  If not, one can always switch the trouble table to use one
of the transactional table types. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A>.

<LI>

With UDF (user defined functions) one can extend MySQL with both normal 
SQL functions and aggregates, but this is not yet as easy or as flexible
as in PostgreSQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_functions">9.1  Adding New Functions to MySQL</A>.

<LI>

Updates and deletes that run over multiple tables is harder to do in
MySQL. This will, hoever, be fixed in MySQL 4.0 with multi-table
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> and multi-table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and in MySQL 4.1
with subselects.

Other reasons to use PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Standard usage in PostgreSQL is closer to ANSI SQL in some cases.

<LI>

One can speed up PostgreSQL by coding things as stored procedures.

<LI>

PostgreSQL has a bigger team of developers that contribute to the server.
</UL>

<P>
Drawbacks with PostgreSQL compared to MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> makes PostgreSQL hard to use in a 24/7 environment.

<LI>

Only transactional tables.

<LI>

Much slower <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="MySQL-PostgreSQL_benchmarks" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL-PostgreSQL_benchmarks">1.5.2.3  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>

</P>
<P>
The only open source benchmark that we know of that can be used to
benchmark MySQL and PostgreSQL (and other databases) is our own. It can
be found at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
We have many times asked the PostgreSQL developers and some PostgreSQL
users to help us extend this benchmark to make it the definitive benchmark
for databases, but unfortunately we haven't gotten any feedback for this.

</P>
<P>
We the MySQL developers have, because of this, spent a lot of hours to get
maximum performance from PostgreSQL for the benchmarks, but because we 
don't know PostgreSQL intimately, we are sure that there are things that 
we have missed.  We have on the benchmark page documented exactly how we 
did run the benchmark so that it should be easy for anyone to repeat and
verify our results.

</P>
<P>
The benchmarks are usually run with and without the <CODE>--fast</CODE> option.
When run with <CODE>--fast</CODE> we are trying to use every trick the server can
do to get the code to execute as fast as possible.  The idea is that the
normal run should show how the server would work in a default setup and 
the <CODE>--fast</CODE> run shows how the server would do if the application 
developer would use extensions in the server to make his application run
faster.

</P>
<P>
When running with PostgreSQL and <CODE>--fast</CODE> we do a <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE>
after every major table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> to make the
database in perfect shape for the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s.  The time for
<CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> is measured separately.

</P>
<P>
When running with PostgreSQL 7.1.1 we could, however, not run with
<CODE>--fast</CODE> because during the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> test, the postmaster (the
PostgreSQL deamon) died and the database was so corrupted that it was
impossible to restart postmaster.   After this happened twice, we decided
to postpone the <CODE>--fast</CODE> test until next PostgreSQL release.  The 
details about the machine we run the benchmark can be found on the 
benchmark page.

</P>
<P>
Before going to the other benchmarks we know of, we would like to give
some background on benchmarks:

</P>
<P>
It's very easy to write a test that shows ANY database to be best
database in the world, by just restricting the test to something the
database is very good at and not test anything that the database is not
good at.  If one after this publishes the result with a single figure,
things are even easier.

</P>
<P>
This would be like us measuring the speed of MySQL compared to PostgreSQL
by looking at the summary time of the MySQL benchmarks on our web page.
Based on this MySQL would be more than 40 times faster than PostgreSQL, 
something that is of course not true.  We could make things even worse 
by just taking the test where PostgreSQL performs worst and claim that 
MySQL is more than 2000 times faster than PostgreSQL.

</P>
<P>
The case is that MySQL does a lot of optimizations that PostgreSQL
doesn't do. This is of course also true the other way around.  An SQL
optimizer is a very complex thing, and a company could spend years on
just making the optimizer faster and faster.

</P>
<P>
When looking at the benchmark results you should look for things that
you do in your application and just use these results to decide which
database would be best suited for your application.  The benchmark
results also shows things a particular database is not good at and should
give you a notion about things to avoid and what you may have to do in
other ways.

</P>
<P>
We know of two benchmark tests that claims that PostgreSQL performs better 
than MySQL.  These both where multi-user tests, a test that we here at 
MySQL AB haven't had time to write and include in the benchmark suite, 
mainly because it's a big task to do this in a manner that is fair against
all databases.

</P>
<P>
One is the benchmark paid for by Great Bridge, which you can read about at:
<a HREF="http://www.greatbridge.com/about/press.php?content_id=4">http://www.greatbridge.com/about/press.php?content_id=4</a>.

</P>
<P>
This is the probably worst benchmark we have ever seen anyone conduct.  This
was not only tuned to only test what PostgreSQL is absolutely best at, it 
was also totally unfair against every other database involved in the test.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  We know that not even some of the main PostgreSQL
developers did like the way Great Bridge conducted the benchmark, so we
don't blame them for the way the benchmark was made.

</P>
<P>
This benchmark has been condemned in a lot of postings and newsgroups so
we will here just shortly repeat some things that where wrong with it.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The tests were run with an expensive commercial tool, that makes it
impossible for an open source company like us to verify the benchmarks,
or even check how the benchmarks were really done.  The tool is not even
a true benchmark tool, but an application/setup testing tool.  To refer
this as a ``standard'' benchmark tool is to stretch the truth a long way.

<LI>

Great Bridge admitted that they had optimized the PostgreSQL database
(with <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> before the test) and tuned the startup for the tests,
something they hadn't done for any of the other databases involved.  To
say ``This process optimizes indexes and frees up disk space a bit.  The
optimized indexes boost performance by some margin.''  Our benchmarks
clearly indicate that the difference in running a lot of selects on a
database with and without <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE> can easily differ by a factor
of ten.

<LI>

The test results were also strange.  The AS3AP test documentation
mentions that the test does ``selections, simple joins, projections, 
aggregates, one-tuple updates, and bulk updates''.

PostgreSQL is good at doing <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s and <CODE>JOIN</CODE>s (especially 
after a <CODE>VACUUM()</CODE>), but doesn't perform as well on <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s or
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>s.  The benchmarks seem to indicate that only <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s 
were done (or very few updates).  This could easily explain they good results
for PostgreSQL in this test.  The bad results for MySQL will be obvious a 
bit down in this document.

<LI>

They did run the so-called benchmark from a Windows machine against a
Linux machine over ODBC, a setup that no normal database user would ever
do when running a heavy multi-user application.  This tested more the
ODBC driver and the Windows protocol used between the clients than the
database itself.

<LI>

When running the database against Oracle and MS-SQL (Great Bridge has
indirectly indicated that the databases they used in the test), they 
didn't use the native protocol but instead ODBC.  Anyone that has ever 
used Oracle knows that all real application uses the native interface 
instead of ODBC.  Doing a test through ODBC and claiming that the results
had anything to do with using the database in a real-world situation can't
be regarded as fair.  They should have done two tests with and without ODBC
to provide the right facts (after having got experts to tune all involved
databases of course).

<LI>

They refer to the TPC-C tests, but they don't mention anywhere that the
test they did was not a true TPC-C test and they were not even allowed to
call it a TPC-C test.  A TPC-C test can only be conducted by the rules
approved by the TPC Council (<a HREF="http://www.tpc.org">http://www.tpc.org</a>). Great Bridge 
didn't do that.  By doing this they have both violated the TPC trademark
and miscredited their own benchmarks.  The rules set by the TPC Council 
are very strict to ensure that no one can produce false results or make
unprovable statements.  Apparently Great Bridge wasn't interested in 
doing this.

<LI>

After the first test, we contacted Great Bridge and mentioned to them
some of the obvious mistakes they had done with MySQL: 


<UL>
<LI>

Running with a debug version of our ODBC driver

<LI>

Running on a Linux system that wasn't optimized for threads

<LI>

Using an old MySQL version when there was a recommended newer one available

<LI>

Not starting MySQL with the right options for heavy multi-user use (the 
default installation of MySQL is tuned for minimal resource use). 
</UL>

Great Bridge did run a new test, with our optimized ODBC driver and with 
better startup options for MySQL, but refused to either use our updated 
glibc library or our standard binary (used by 80% of our users), which was
statically linked with a fixed glibc library.

According to what we know, Great Bridge did nothing to ensure that the
other databases were set up correctly to run well in their test
environment.  We are sure however that they didn't contact Oracle or
Microsoft to ask for their advice in this matter ;)

<LI>

The benchmark was paid for by Great Bridge, and they decided to publish
only partial, chosen results (instead of publishing it all).
</UL>

<P>
Tim Perdue, a long time PostgreSQL fan and a reluctant MySQL user
published a comparison on
<a HREF="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20001112.php3">phpbuider</a>.

</P>
<P>
When we became aware of the comparison, we phoned Tim Perdue about this
because there were a lot of strange things in his results.  For example,
he claimed that MySQL had a problem with five users in his tests, when we
know that there are users with similar machines as his that are using
MySQL with 2000 simultaneous connections doing 400 queries per second.
(In this case the limit was the web bandwidth, not the database.)

</P>
<P>
It sounded like he was using a Linux kernel that either had some
problems with many threads, such as kernels before 2.4, which had a problem 
with many threads on multi-CPU machines. We have documented in this manual
how to fix this and Tim should be aware of this problem.

</P>
<P>
The other possible problem could have been an old glibc library and
that Tim didn't use a MySQL binary from our site, which is linked with
a corrected glibc library, but had compiled a version of his own with.
In any of the above cases, the symptom would have been exactly what Tim
had measured.

</P>
<P>
We asked Tim if we could get access to his data so that we could repeat
the benchmark and if he could check the MySQL version on the machine to
find out what was wrong and he promised to come back to us about this.
He has not done that yet.

</P>
<P>
Because of this we can't put any trust in this benchmark either :(

</P>
<P>
Over time things also changes and the above benchmarks are not that
relevant anymore.  MySQL now have a couple of different table handlers
with different speed/concurrency tradeoffs.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>. It
would be interesting to see how the above tests would run with the
different transactional table types in MySQL.  PostgreSQL has of course
also got new features since the test was made.  As the above test are
not publicly available there is no way for us to know how the
database would preform in the same tests today.

</P>

<P>
Conclusion:

</P>
<P>
The only benchmarks that exist today that anyone can download and run
against MySQL and PostgreSQL is the MySQL benchmarks.  We here at MySQL 
believe that open source databases should be tested with open source tools!
This is the only way to ensure that no one does tests that nobody can 
reproduce and use this to claim that a database is better than another.
Without knowing all the facts it's impossible to answer the claims of the
tester.

</P>
<P>
The thing we find strange is that every test we have seen about
PostgreSQL, that is impossible to reproduce, claims that PostgreSQL is
better in most cases while our tests, which anyone can reproduce,
clearly shows otherwise.  With this we don't want to say that PostgreSQL
isn't good at many things (it is!) or that it isn't faster than MySQL
under certain conditions.  We would just like to see a fair test where
they are very good so that we could get some friendly competition going!

</P>

<P>
We are working on an even better benchmark suite, including multi user
tests, and a better documentation of what the individual tests really
do and how to add more tests to the suite.

<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_4.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_4.0">1.6.1  Things that should be in 4.0</A></H3>

<P>
We plan to make MySQL Version 4.0 a ``quick'' release where we only
add some new stuff to enable others to help us with developing new features
into Version 4.1.  The MySQL 4.0 version should only take us about
a month to make after which we want to stabilize it and start working on
Version 4.1.  Version 4.0 should have the following new features:

</P>
<P>
The news section for 4.0 includes a list of the features we have already
implemented in the 4.0 tree. See section <A HREF="manual.html#News-4.0.x">F.1  Changes in release 4.0.x (Development; Alpha)</A>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

New table definition file format (<CODE>.frm</CODE> files) This will enable us
to not run out of bits when adding more table options.  One will still
be able to use the old <CODE>.frm</CODE> file format with 4.0.  All newly created
tables will, however, use the new format.

The new file format will enable us to add new column types, more options
for keys and <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> support.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a library.  This will have the same interface as the
standard MySQL client (with an extra function to just set up
startup parameters) but will be faster (no TCP/IP or socket overhead),
smaller and much easier to use for embedded products.

One will be able to define at link time if one wants to use the
client/server model or a stand-alone application just by defining which
library to link with.

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will support all standard MySQL features and
one can use it in a threaded client to run different queries in each
thread.
<LI>

Replication should work with <CODE>RAND()</CODE> and user variables <CODE>@var</CODE>.
<LI>

Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will
make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the
master.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> will return the number of deleted rows. For
fast execution one should use <CODE>TRUNCATE table_name</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>DELETE</CODE> on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables to use the record cache.
To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
the <CODE>.MYD</CODE> file.
<LI>

Better replication.
<LI>

More functions for full-text search.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Features_to_Appear_in_MySQL_4.0">6.8.3  New Features of Full-text Search to Appear in MySQL 4.0</A>.
<LI>

Character set casts and syntax for handling multiple character sets.
<LI>

Allow users to change startup options without taking down the server.
<LI>

Help for all commands from the client.
<LI>

Secure connections (with SSL).
<LI>

Extend the optimizer to be able to optimize some <CODE>ORDER BY key_name DESC</CODE>
queries.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name</CODE> (used by <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to allow
expansions of column names) should not open the table, but only the
definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.
<LI>

New key cache
<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> we should translate the whole query
at once and not only strings. This will enable users to use the translated
characters in database, table and column names.
<LI>

Add a portable interface over <CODE>gethostbyaddr_r()</CODE> so that we can change
<CODE>ip_to_hostname()</CODE> to not block other threads while doing DNS lookups.
<LI>

Add <CODE>record_in_range()</CODE> method to <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables to be
able to choose the right index when there is many to choose from. We should
also extend the info interface to get the key distribution for each index,
of <CODE>analyze</CODE> is run on all sub tables.
<LI>

<CODE>SET SQL_DEFAULT_TABLE_TYPE=[MyISAM | INNODB | BDB | HEAP]</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_future" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_future">1.6.2  Things that must be done in the real near future</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fail safe replication.
<LI>

Subqueries.
<CODE>select id from t where grp in (select grp from g where u &#62; 100)</CODE>
<LI>

Derived tables.

<PRE>
select a.col1, b.col2 from (select max(col1) as col1 from root_table ) a,
other_table b where a.col1=b.col1
</PRE>

This could be done by automatically creating temporary tables for the
derived tables for the duration of the query.
<LI>

Add <CODE>PREPARE</CODE> of statements and sending of parameters to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Extend the server/client protocol to support warnings.
<LI>

Add options to the server/protocol protocol to get progress notes
for long running commands.
<LI>

Add database and real table name (in case of alias) to the MYSQL_FIELD
structure.
<LI>

Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run MyISAM recover
at the same time.
<LI>

Change <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> to optionally use concurrent inserts.
<LI>

Implement <CODE>RENAME DATABASE</CODE>. To make this safe for all table handlers,
it should work as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

Create the new database.
<LI>

For every table do a rename of the table to another database, as
we do with the <CODE>RENAME</CODE> command.
<LI>

Drop the old database.
</UL>

<LI>

Return the original field types() when doing <CODE>SELECT MIN(column)
... GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Multiple result sets.
<LI>

Change the protocol to allow binary transfer of values. To do this
efficiently, we need to add an API to allow binding of variables.
<LI>

Make it possible to specify <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> with a granularity
in microseconds.
<LI>

Add a configurable prompt to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line client, with
options like database in use, time and date...
<LI>

Add range checking to <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Link the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> code into the server.
<LI>

Port of MySQL to BeOS.
<LI>

Port of the MySQL clients to LynxOS.
<LI>

Add a temporary key buffer cache during <CODE>INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE</CODE> so that we
can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.
<LI>

If you perform an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a table that is symlinked to another
disk, create temporary tables on this disk.
<LI>

Implement a <CODE>DATE/DATETIME</CODE> type that handles time zone information
properly, so that dealing with dates in different time zones is easier.
<LI>

FreeBSD and MIT-pthreads;  Do sleeping threads take CPU?
<LI>

Check if locked threads take any CPU.
<LI>

Fix configure so that one can compile all libraries (like <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>)
without threads.
<LI>

Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed keys
if they haven't been used in a while.
<LI>

Allow join on key parts (optimization issue).
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld --concurrent-insert</CODE> to do
a concurrent insert at the end of the file if the file is read-locked.
<LI>

Remember <CODE>FOREIGN</CODE> key definitions in the <TT>`.frm'</TT> file.
<LI>

Cascading <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
<LI>

Server side cursors.
<LI>

Check if <CODE>lockd</CODE> works with modern Linux kernels; If not, we have
to fix <CODE>lockd</CODE>!  To test this, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--enable-locking</CODE> and run the different fork* test suits. They shouldn't
give any errors if <CODE>lockd</CODE> works.
<LI>

Allow SQL variables in <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, like in <CODE>LIMIT @a,@b</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow update of variables in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements. For example:
<CODE>UPDATE TABLE foo SET @a=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c</CODE>
<LI>

Change when user variables are updated so that one can use them with
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, as in the following example:
<CODE>SELECT id, @a:=count(*), sum(sum_col)/@a FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>.
<LI>

Don't add automatic <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values to columns.  Give an error when using
an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> that doesn't contain a column that doesn't have a
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.
<LI>

Caching of queries and results. This should be done as a separated
module that examines each query and if this is query is in the cache
the cached result should be returned.  When one updates a table one
should remove as few queries as possible from the cache.
This should give a big speed bost on machines with much RAM where
queries are often repeated (like WWW applications).
One idea would be to only cache queries of type:
<CODE>SELECT CACHED ...</CODE>
<LI>

Fix <TT>`libmysql.c'</TT> to allow two <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> commands in a row
without reading results or give a nice error message when one does this.
<LI>

Optimize <CODE>BIT</CODE> type to take 1 bit (now <CODE>BIT</CODE> takes 1 char).
<LI>

Check why MIT-pthreads <CODE>ctime()</CODE> doesn't work on some FreeBSD systems.
<LI>

Add an <CODE>IMAGE</CODE> option to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to not update
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> and <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> fields.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LOAD DATE INFILE.. UPDATE</CODE> syntax.

<UL>
<LI>

For tables with primary keys, if the data contains the primary key,
entries matching that primary key are updated from the remainder of the
columns. However, columns MISSING from the incoming data feed are not
touched.
<LI>

For tables tables with primary keys that are missing some part of the key
in the incoming data stream, or that have no primary key, the feed is
treated as a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO</CODE> is now.
</UL>

<LI>

Make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> understand syntax like:

<PRE>
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3)
SET table_field1=concatenate(text_field1, text_field2), table_field3=23
IGNORE text_field3

This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file, or update columns
based on expressions of the read data...
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' INTO TABLE 'table_name' ERRORS TO err_table_name</CODE>
This would cause any errors and warnings to be logged into the err_table_name
table. That table would have a structure like:


<PRE>
line_number    - line number in data file
error_message  - the error/warning message
and maybe
data_line      - the line from the data file
</PRE>

<LI>

Add true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> support (There is already support for this in MyISAM).
<LI>

Automatic output from <CODE>mysql</CODE> to netscape.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK DATABASES</CODE>. (with various options)
<LI>

Change sort to allocate memory in ``hunks'' to get better memory utilization.
<LI>

<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> types can't read exponential numbers;
<CODE>Field_decimal::store(const char *from,uint len)</CODE> must be recoded
to fix this.
<LI>

Functions:
ADD_TO_SET(value,set) and REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set)
<LI>

Add use of <CODE>t1 JOIN t2 ON ...</CODE> and <CODE>t1 JOIN t2 USING ...</CODE>
Currently, you can only use this syntax with <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.
<LI>

Add full support for <CODE>unsigned long long</CODE> type.
<LI>

Many more variables for <CODE>show status</CODE>.  Counts for:
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>/<CODE>DELETE</CODE>/<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements. Records reads and
updated.  Selects on 1 table and selects with joins.  Mean number of
tables in select. Number of <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries.
<LI>

If you abort <CODE>mysql</CODE> in the middle of a query, you should open
another connection and kill the old running query.
Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.
<LI>

Add a handler interface for table information so you can use it as a system
table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables,
but very flexible.  <CODE>SHOW INFO FROM tbl_name</CODE> for basic table information
should be implemented.
<LI>

Add support for UNICODE.
<LI>

<CODE>NATURAL JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>UNION JOIN</CODE>
<LI>

Allow <CODE>select a from crash_me left join crash_me2 using (a)</CODE>; In this
case a is assumed to come from the crash_me table.
<LI>

Fix that <CODE>ON</CODE> and <CODE>USING</CODE> works with the <CODE>JOIN</CODE>
join type.
<LI>

Oracle like <CODE>CONNECT BY PRIOR ...</CODE> to search hierarchy structures.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin copy database new-database</CODE>. -- Requires COPY command to be
added to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<LI>

Processlist should show number of queries/thread.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW HOSTS</CODE> for printing information about the hostname cache.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> options to the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
(this will delete rows when one gets a duplicate key error while updating).
<LI>

Change the format of <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> to store fractions of seconds.
<LI>

Add all missing ANSI92 and ODBC 3.0 types.
<LI>

Change table names from empty strings to <CODE>NULL</CODE> for calculated columns.
<LI>

Don't use 'Item_copy_string' on numerical values to avoid
number-&#62;string-&#62;number conversion in case of:
<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>
<LI>

Make it possible to use the new GNU regexp library instead of the current
one (The GNU library should be much faster than the old one).
<LI>

Change that <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> doesn't abort clients that executes
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix that when columns referenced in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> clause contains the old
values before the update started.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> should be able
to handle cases where the data and/or index files are symbolic links.
<LI>

Add simulation of <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE> on Windows to enable
concurrent inserts.
<LI>

A logfile analyzer that could parsed out information about which tables
are hit most often, how often multi-table joins are executed, etc.  It
should help users identify areas or table design that could be optimized
to execute much more efficient queries.
<LI>

Add <CODE>SUM(DISTINCT)</CODE>
<LI>

Add <CODE>ANY()</CODE>,<CODE>EVERY()</CODE> and <CODE>SOME()</CODE> group functions. In
ANSI SQL these only works on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
work on any columns/expressions by applying: value == 0 -&#62; FALSE and
value &#60;&#62; 0 -&#62; TRUE.
<LI>

Fix that the type for <CODE>MAX(column)</CODE> is the same as the column type.

<PRE>
create table t1 (a DATE);
insert into t1 values (now());
create table t2 select max(a) from t1;
show columns from t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

Come up with a nice syntax for a statement that will <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> the row
if it exists and <CODE>INSERT</CODE> a new row if the row didn't exist.
(Like <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> works with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> / <CODE>DELETE</CODE>)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_sometime" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_sometime">1.6.3  Things that have to be done sometime</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Implement function: <CODE>get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)</CODE>
<LI>

Atomic multi-table updates, eg <CODE>update items,month set
items.price=month.price where items.id=month.id;</CODE>;
<LI>

Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only
compressed tables use memmap.
<LI>

Add a new privilege <STRONG>'Show_priv'</STRONG> for <CODE>SHOW</CODE> commands.
<LI>

Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update
log with <CODE>SET TIMESTAMP=#;</CODE>
<LI>

Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.
<LI>

Full foreign key support. One probably wants to implement a procedural
language first.
<LI>

Simple views (first on one table, later on any expression).
<LI>

Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table or temporary files
gets error 23 (not enough open files).
<LI>

When one finds a field=#, change all occurrences of field to #.  Now this
is only done for some simple cases.
<LI>

Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.
<LI>

Optimize key = expression. At the moment only key = field or key =
constant are optimized.
<LI>

Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.
<LI>

Change <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
better error messages (5 days).
<LI>

Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments
in function.
<LI>

Use of full calculation names in the order part. (For ACCESS97)
<LI>

<CODE>UNION</CODE>, <CODE>MINUS</CODE>, <CODE>INTERSECT</CODE> and <CODE>FULL OUTER JOIN</CODE>.
(Currently only <CODE>LEFT OUTER JOIN</CODE> is supported)
<LI>

Allow <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> on fields that can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#</CODE> to put a time limit on a query.
<LI>

Make the update log to a database.
<LI>

Negative <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to retrieve data from the end.
<LI>

Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.
<LI>

Please note the changes to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>: according to FSSTND (which
Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into <TT>`/var/run/&#60;progname&#62;.pid'</TT>
and log files into <TT>`/var/log'</TT>. It would be nice if you could put the
"DATADIR" in the first declaration of "pidfile" and "log", so the
placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.
<LI>

Allow a client to request logging.
<LI>

Add use of <CODE>zlib()</CODE> for <CODE>gzip</CODE>-ed files to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix sorting and grouping of <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns (partly solved now).
<LI>

Stored procedures.  This is currently not regarded to be very
important as stored procedures are not very standardized yet.
Another problem is that true stored procedures make it much harder for
the optimizer and in many cases the result is slower than before
We will, on the other hand, add a simple (atomic) update language that
can be used to write loops and such in the MySQL server.
<LI>

Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement
a semaphore library to MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Don't assign a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value when one sets a column to 0.
Use <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Add full support for <CODE>JOIN</CODE> with parentheses.
<LI>

As an alternative for one thread / connection manage a pool of threads
to handle the queries.
<LI>

Allow one to get more than one lock with <CODE>GET_LOCK</CODE>.  When doing this,
one must also handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.

This chapter describes how to obtain and install MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For a list of sites from which you can obtain MySQL, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

<LI>

To see which platforms are supported, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>. Please note that
not all supported system are equally good for running MySQL on them.
On some it is much more robust and efficient than others - see  section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>
for details.

<LI>

Several versions of MySQL are available in both binary and
source distributions.  We also provide public access to our current
source tree for those who want to see our most recent developments and
help us test new code.  To determine which version and type of
distribution you should use, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_version">2.2.3  Which MySQL Version to Use</A>. When in doubt,
use the binary distribution.

<LI>

Installation instructions for binary and source distributions are described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">M.1  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.  Each set of
instructions includes a section on system-specific problems you may run
into.

<LI>

For post-installation procedures, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>.  These
procedures apply whether you install MySQL using a binary or
source distribution.

<H3><A NAME="Linux-RPM" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-RPM">2.1.1  Installing MySQL on Linux</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>

</P>
<P>
The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using an RPM
file. The MySQL RPMs are currently being built on a RedHat Version
6.2 system but should work on other versions of Linux that support <CODE>rpm</CODE>
and use <CODE>glibc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with an RPM file, for example, if you receive the error
``<CODE>Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up</CODE>'', see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_notes-Linux">2.6.1.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions</A>.

</P>
<P>
The RPM files you may want to use are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
connect to a MySQL server running on another machine.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
install this package.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and msql-mysql-modules RPMs.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

Libraries and include files needed if you want to compile other
MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm</CODE>

This contains the source code for all of the above packages. It can also
be used to try to build RPMs for other architectures (for example, Alpha
or SPARC).
</UL>

<P>
To see all files in an RPM package, run:

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -qpl MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To install just the client package, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
The RPM places data in <TT>`/var/lib/mysql'</TT>. The RPM also creates the
appropriate entries in <TT>`/etc/rc.d/'</TT> to start the server automatically
at boot time.  (This means that if you have performed a previous
installation, you may want to make a copy of your previously installed
MySQL startup file if you made any changes to it, so you don't lose
your changes.)

</P>
<P>
After installing the RPM file(s), the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon should be running
and you should now be able to start using MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary
installation chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">M.1  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Windows_installation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows_installation">2.1.2  Installing MySQL on Windows</A></H3>

<P>
The following instructions apply to precompiled binary distributions.
If you download a source distribution, you will have to compile and install
it yourself.

</P>
<P>
If you don't have a copy of the MySQL distribution, you should 
first download one from <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you plan to connect to MySQL from some other program, you will
probably also need the <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> driver. You can find this at the
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> download page
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>).

</P>
<P>
To install either distribution, unzip it in some empty directory and run the
<CODE>Setup.exe</CODE> program.

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL-Windows is configured to be installed in
<TT>`C:\mysql'</TT>.  If you want to install MySQL elsewhere,
install it in <TT>`C:\mysql'</TT> first, then move the installation to
where you want it.  If you do move MySQL, you must indicate
where everything is located by supplying a <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option when
you start the server.  For example, if you have moved the MySQL
distribution to <TT>`D:\programs\mysql'</TT>, you must start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; D:\programs\mysql\bin\mysqld --basedir D:\programs\mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Use <CODE>mysqld --help</CODE> to display all the options that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
understands!

</P>
<P>
With all newer MySQL versions, you can also create a
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file that holds any default options for the
MySQL server.  Copy the file <TT>`\mysql\my-xxxxx.cnf'</TT> to
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> and edit it to suit your setup.  Note that you should
specify all paths with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>. If you use
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, you need to specify it twice, because <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is the escape
character in MySQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL 3.23.38, the Windows distribution includes
both the normal and the <STRONG>MySQL-Max</STRONG> binaries.  The main benefit
of using the normal <CODE>mysqld.exe</CODE> binary is that it's a little
faster and uses less resources.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of the different MySQL servers you can use:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqld</CODE> </TD><TD>
Compiled with full debugging and automatic memory allocation checking,
symbolic links, BDB and InnoDB tables.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqld-opt</CODE> </TD><TD>
Optimized binary with no support for transactional tables.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> </TD><TD>
Optimized binary for NT with support for named pipes. You can run this
version on Win98, but in this case no named pipes are created and you must
have TCP/IP installed.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> </TD><TD>
Optimized binary with support for symbolic links, BDB and InnoDB tables.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> </TD><TD>
Like <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, but compiled with support for named pipes.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is started with
<CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All of the above binaries are optimized for the Pentium Pro processor but
should work on any Intel processor &#62;= i386.

</P>
<P>
NOTE: If you want to use InnoDB tables, there are certain startup
options that must be specified in your <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file! See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.6.2  InnoDB startup options</A>.

We use GNU Autoconf, so it is possible to port MySQL to all modern
systems with working Posix threads and a C++ compiler.  (To compile only the
client code, a C++ compiler is required but not threads.)  We use and develop
the software ourselves primarily on Sun Solaris (Versions 2.5 - 2.7) and
SuSE Linux Version 7.x.

<P>
Note that not all platforms are suited equally well for running
MySQL. How well a certain platform is suited for a high-load
mission critical MySQL server is determined by the following
factors:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

General stability of the thread library. A platform may have excellent
reputation otherwise, but if the thread library is unstable in the code
that is called by MySQL, even if everything else is perfect, MySQL will
be only as stable as the thread library.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage of
<STRONG>SMP</STRONG> on multi-processor systems. In other words, when a process
creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to run on a different
CPU than the original process.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many threads which
acquire/release a mutex over a short critical region frequently without
excessive context switches. In other words, if the implementation of
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> is too anxious to yield CPU, this will hurt
MySQL tremendously. If this issue is not taken care of, adding extra CPUs
will actually make MySQL slower.

<LI>

General file system stability/performance.

<LI>

Ability of the file system to deal with large files at all and deal with them
efficiently, if your tables are big.

<LI>

Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we know
a platform well, we introduce platform-specific optimizations/fixes enabled at
compile time. We can also provide advice on configuring your system optimally
for MySQL.

<LI>

The amount of testing of similar configurations we have done internally.

<LI>

The number of users that have successfully run MySQL on that
platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the chances of
hitting some platform-specific surprise are much smaller.
</UL>

<P>
Based on the above criteria, the best platforms for running
MySQL at this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 7.1, 2.4 kernel and
ReiserFS (or any similar Linux distribution) and Sparc with Solaris 2.7
or 2.8. FreeBSD comes third, but we really hope it will join the top
club once the thread library is improved. We also hope that at some
point we will be able to include all other platforms on which
MySQL compiles, runs ok, but not quite with the same level of
stability and performance, into the top category. This will require some
effort on our part in cooperation with the developers of the OS/library
components MySQL depends upon. If you are interested in making
one of those components better, are in a position to influence their
development, and need more detailed instructions on what MySQL
needs to run better, send an e-mail to
<a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
Please note that the comparison above is not to say that one OS is better or
worse than the other in general. We are talking about choosing a particular OS
for a dedicated purpose - running MySQL, and compare platforms in that
regard only. With this in mind, the result of this comparison
would be different if we included more issues into it. And in some cases,
the reason one OS is better than the other could simply be that we have put
forth more effort into testing on and optimizing for that particular platform.
We are just stating our observations to help you make a
decision on which platform to use MySQL on in your setup.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Which_version" HREF="manual_toc.html#Which_version">2.2.3  Which MySQL Version to Use</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>

</P>
<P>
The first decision to make is whether you want to use the latest development
release or the last stable release:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time
or trying to port it to some system for which there is no binary
distribution, we recommend going with the stable release (currently
Version 3.23.51.  Note that all MySQL releases are
checked with the MySQL benchmarks and an extensive test suite
before each release.

<LI>

Otherwise, if you are running an old system and want to upgrade, but
don't want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you should
upgrade to the latest in the same branch you are using (where only the
last version number is newer than yours).  We have tried to fix only
fatal bugs and make small, relatively safe changes to that version.
</UL>

<P>
The second decision to make is whether you want to use a source
distribution or a binary distribution.  In most cases you should probably
use a binary distribution, if one exists for your platform, as this
generally will be easier to install than a source distribution.

</P>
<P>
In the following cases you probably will be better off with a source
installation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  (The standard
binary distributions are ``ready to run'' at any place, but you may want
to get even more flexibility).

<LI>

To be able to satisfy different user requirements, we are providing two
different binary versions; One compiled with the non-transactional table
handlers, (a small, fast binary), and one configured with the most
important extended options like transaction-safe tables.  Both versions
are compiled from the same source distribution.  All native <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
clients can connect to both MySQL versions.

The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the
<CODE>-max</CODE> suffix and is configured with the same options as
<CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  mysqld-max, An extended mysqld server</A>.

If you want to use the <CODE>MySQL-Max</CODE> RPM, you must first
install the standard <CODE>MySQL</CODE> RPM.

<LI>

If you want to configure <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with some extra features that are 
NOT in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the most 
common extra options that you may want to use:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>--with-berkeley-db</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-innodb</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-raid</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-libwrap</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-named-z-lib  (This is done for some of the binaries)</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-debug[=full]</CODE>

</UL>

<LI>

The default binary distribution is normally compiled with support
for all characters sets and should work on a variety of processors from
the same processor family.

If you want a faster MySQL server you may want to recompile it
with support for only the character sets you need, use a better compiler
(like <CODE>pgcc</CODE>) or use compiler options that are better optimized for your
processor.

<LI>

If you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL
development team you will probably receive a patch that you need to apply to
the source distribution to get the bug fixed.

<LI>

If you want to read (and/or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up
MySQL, you should get a source distribution.  The source code is
always the ultimate manual.  Source distributions also contain more
tests and examples than binary distributions.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL naming scheme uses release numbers that consist of three
numbers and a suffix.  For example, a release name like
<CODE>mysql-3.21.17-beta</CODE> is interpreted like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first number (<CODE>3</CODE>) describes the file format.  All Version 3 
releases have the same file format.

<LI>

The second number (<CODE>21</CODE>) is the release level.  Normally there are two to
choose from. One is the release/stable branch (currently <CODE>23</CODE>) and the
other is the development branch (currently <CODE>4.0</CODE>).  Normally both are
stable, but the development version may have quirks, missing documentation on
new features, or may fail to compile on some systems.

<LI>

The third number (<CODE>17</CODE>) is the version number within the
release level.  This is incremented for each new distribution.  Usually you
want the latest version for the release level you have chosen.

<LI>

The suffix (<CODE>beta</CODE>) indicates the stability level of the release.
The possible suffixes are:


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>alpha</CODE> indicates that the release contains some large section of
new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs (usually there are none)
should be documented in the News section.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">F  MySQL change history</A>.  There are also new
commands and extensions in most alpha releases.  Active development that
may involve major code changes can occur on an alpha release, but everything
will be tested before doing a release.  There should be no known bugs in any
MySQL release.

<LI>

<CODE>beta</CODE> means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
features that could cause corruption on old code are added.  There should
be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha to beta when there
haven't been any reported fatal bugs within an alpha version for at least
a month and we don't plan to add any features that could make any old command
more unreliable.

<LI>

<CODE>gamma</CODE> is a beta that has been around a while and seems to work fine.
Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many other companies call a release.

<LI>

If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run for a
while at many different sites with no reports of bugs other than
platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes are applied to the
release. This is what we call a stable release.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
All versions of MySQL are run through our standard tests and
benchmarks to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the
standard tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>An internal test suite
<DD>
This is part of a production system for a customer.  It has many tables with
hundreds of megabytes of data.

<DT>The MySQL benchmark suite
<DD>
This runs a range of common queries.  It is also a test to see whether the
latest batch of optimizations actually made the code faster.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<DT>The <CODE>crash-me</CODE> test

This tries to determine what features the database supports and what its
capabilities and limitations are.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

Another test is that we use the newest MySQL version in our internal
production environment, on at least one machine.  We have more than 100
gigabytes of data to work with.

installing binary and source distributions.

</P>
<P>
A binary distribution is installed by unpacking it at the installation
location you choose (typically <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>) and creates the
following directories in that location:

<P>
Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation differs
from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is installed in the <TT>`libexec'</TT>
directory rather than in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory.

<LI>

The data directory is <TT>`var'</TT> rather than <TT>`data'</TT>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is installed in the <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT> directory
rather than in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/scripts'</TT>.

<LI>

The header file and library directories are <TT>`include/mysql'</TT> and
<TT>`lib/mysql'</TT> rather than <TT>`include'</TT> and <TT>`lib'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we
want to share this with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release
when we have very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

</P>
<P>
We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended e-mail supported customers
want and try to help them out.

</P>
<P>
No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">F  MySQL change history</A>.

</P>
<P>
We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For each minor update, the last number in the version string is incremented.
When there are major new features or minor incompatibilities with previous
versions, the second number in the version string is incremented.  When the
file format changes, the first number is increased.

<LI>

Stable tested releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a year, but
if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes will be released.

<LI>

Working releases are meant to appear about every 1-8 weeks.

<LI>

Binary distributions for some platforms will be made by us for major releases.
Other people may make binary distributions for other systems but probably
less frequently.

<LI>

We usually make patches available as soon as we have located and fixed
small bugs.

<LI>

For non-critical but annoying bugs, we will make patches available if they
are sent to us.  Otherwise we will combine many of them into a larger
patch.

<LI>

If there is, by any chance, a fatal bug in a release we will make a new
release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies to do this,
too.
</UL>

<P>
The current stable release is Version 3.23; We have already moved active
development to Version 4.0.  Bugs will still be fixed in the stable version.
We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves out bug fixes
and things that ``must be done.''  ``Somewhat frozen'' means that we may
add small things that ``almost surely will not affect anything that's
already working.''

Before you proceed with the source installation, check first to see if our
binary is available for your platform and if it will work for you. We 
put in a lot of effort into making sure that our binaries are built with the
best possible options.

</P>
<P>
You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>gunzip</CODE> to uncompress the distribution.

<LI>

A reasonable <CODE>tar</CODE> to unpack the distribution.  GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> is
known to work.  Sun <CODE>tar</CODE> is known to have problems.

<LI>

A working ANSI C++ compiler.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2, <CODE>egcs</CODE> &#62;= 1.0.2
or <CODE>egcs 2.91.66</CODE>, SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
compilers that are known to work.  <CODE>libg++</CODE> is not needed when
using <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible
to compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as
<TT>`sql/sql_base.cc'</TT>.  If you only have <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x, you must
upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> to be able to compile MySQL. <CODE>gcc</CODE>
2.8.1 is also known to have problems on some platforms so it should be
avoided if there exists a new compiler for the platform..

<CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2 is recommended when compiling MySQL
Version 3.23.x.

<LI>

A good <CODE>make</CODE> program.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is always recommended and is
sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> 3.75 or newer.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using a recent version of <STRONG>gcc</STRONG>, recent enough to understand
<CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> option, it is <STRONG>VERY IMPORTANT</STRONG> that you use
it. Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use <CODE>-felide-contructors</CODE> and <CODE>-fno-rtti</CODE> along
with <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE>. When in doubt, do the following:

</P>

<PRE>

CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

</PRE>

<P>
On most systems this will give you a fast and stable binary.

</P>
<P>
If you run into problems, <STRONG>PLEASE ALWAYS USE <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE></STRONG> when
posting questions to <a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.  Even if the problem
isn't a bug, <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> gathers system information that will help others
solve your problem.  By not using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>, you lessen the likelihood
of getting a solution to your problem!  You will find <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> in the
<TT>`scripts'</TT> directory after you unpack the distribution.

<P>
The basic commands you must execute to install a MySQL source
distribution are:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
shell&#62; cd mysql-VERSION
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
shell&#62; /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you want have support for InnoDB tables, you should edit the
<CODE>/etc/my.cnf</CODE> file and remove the <CODE>#</CODE> character before the
parameters that starts with <CODE>innodb_...</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.6.2  InnoDB startup options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you start from a source RPM, then do the following:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm --rebuild MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
This will make a binary RPM that you can install.

</P>
<P>
You can add new users using the <CODE>bin/mysql_setpermission</CODE> script if
you install the <CODE>DBI</CODE> and <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> Perl modules.

</P>
<P>
A more detailed description follows.

</P>
<P>
To install a source distribution, follow the steps below, then proceed
to section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>, for post-installation initialization and testing:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution, and move
into it.

<LI>

Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

<LI>

If you are interested in using Berkeley DB tables with MySQL, you
will need to obtain a patched version of the Berkeley DB source
code.  Please read the chapter on Berkeley DB tables before
proceeding.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.5  BDB or Berkeley_DB Tables</A>.

MySQL source distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE>
archives and have names like <TT>`mysql-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT>, where
<CODE>VERSION</CODE> is a number like 3.23.51.

<LI>

Add a user and group for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
</PRE>

These commands add the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group, and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user.  The
syntax for <CODE>useradd</CODE> and <CODE>groupadd</CODE> may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called <CODE>adduser</CODE> and <CODE>addgroup</CODE>.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of <CODE>mysql</CODE>.

<LI>

Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; /path/to/mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

This command creates a directory named <TT>`mysql-VERSION'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql-VERSION
</PRE>

Note that currently you must configure and build MySQL from
this top-level directory.  You can not build it in a different
directory.

<LI>

Configure the release and compile everything:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; make
</PRE>

When you run <CODE>configure</CODE>, you might want to specify some options.
Run <CODE>./configure --help</CODE> for a list of options.
section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>, discusses some of the
more useful options.

If <CODE>configure</CODE> fails, and you are going to send mail to
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a> to ask for assistance, please include any
lines from <TT>`config.log'</TT> that you think can help solve the problem.  Also
include the last couple of lines of output from <CODE>configure</CODE> if
<CODE>configure</CODE> aborts.  Post the bug report using the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>
script.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

If the compile fails, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Compilation_problems">2.3.5  Problems Compiling?</A>, for help with
a number of common problems.

<LI>

Install everything:


<PRE>
shell&#62; make install
</PRE>

You might need to run this command as <CODE>root</CODE>.

<LI>

Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
installed MySQL before):


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
MySQL server when you run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  This is no
longer true!

<LI>

Change ownership of binaries to <CODE>root</CODE> and ownership of the data 
directory to the user that you will run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

The first command changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the files to the
<CODE>root</CODE> user, the second one changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the 
data directory to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user, and the third one changes the
<CODE>group</CODE> attribute to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group.

<LI>

If you want to install support for the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_support">M.2  Perl Installation Comments</A>.

<LI>

If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy <CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
<CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> script itself and in 
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.
</OL>

<P>
After everything has been installed, you should initialize and test your
distribution:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If that command fails immediately with <CODE>mysqld daemon ended</CODE> then you can
find some information in the file <TT>`mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'</TT>.
The likely reason is that you already have another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server 
running.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Multiple_servers">4.1.4  Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

MySQL Web site.

</P>
<P>
To apply a patch from the mailing list, save the message in which the patch
appears in a file, change into the top-level directory of your MySQL
source tree, and run these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; patch -p1 &#60; patch-file-name
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; make clean
</PRE>

<P>
Patches from the FTP site are distributed as plain text files or as files
compressed with <CODE>gzip</CODE>.  Apply a plain patch as shown above for
mailing list patches.  To apply a compressed patch, change into the
top-level directory of your MySQL source tree and run these
commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; patch-file-name.gz | patch -p1
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; make clean

After applying a patch, follow the instructions for a normal source install,
beginning with the <CODE>./configure</CODE> step.  After running the <CODE>make
install</CODE> step, restart your MySQL server.

</P>
<P>
You may need to bring down any currently running server before you run
<CODE>make install</CODE>.  (Use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> to do this.)  Some
systems do not allow you to install a new version of a program if it replaces
the version that is currently executing.

The <CODE>configure</CODE> script gives you a great deal of control over how
you configure your MySQL distribution.  Typically you do this
using options on the <CODE>configure</CODE> command line.  You can also affect
<CODE>configure</CODE> using certain environment variables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.  For a list of options supported by <CODE>configure</CODE>, run
this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --help
</PRE>

<P>
Some of the more commonly-used <CODE>configure</CODE> options are described below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
not the server, use the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --without-server
</PRE>

If you don't have a C++ compiler, <CODE>mysql</CODE> will not compile (it is the
one client program that requires C++).  In this case,
you can remove the code in <CODE>configure</CODE> that tests for the C++ compiler
and then run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option. The
compile step will still try to build <CODE>mysql</CODE>, but you can ignore any
warnings about <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT>.  (If <CODE>make</CODE> stops, try <CODE>make -k</CODE>
to tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors occur.)

<LI>

If you don't want your log files and database directories located under
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>, use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command, something like one
of these:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
           --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data
</PRE>

The first command changes the installation prefix so that everything is
installed under <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> rather than the default of
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.  The second command preserves the default installation
prefix, but overrides the default location for database directories
(normally <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>) and changes it to
<CODE>/usr/local/mysql/data</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<LI>

If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located somewhere
other than the default location (normally in the directory <TT>`/tmp'</TT> or
<TT>`/var/run'</TT>) use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock
</PRE>

Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname!
You can also later change the location <TT>`mysql.sock'</TT> by using the MySQL 
option files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or change the MySQL socket file <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<LI>

If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to make a
binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around problems with some
RedHat Linux distributions), run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-client-ldflags=-all-static \
           --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX225"></A>

<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
<LI>

If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and don't have <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
installed, you can tell <CODE>configure</CODE> to use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++
compiler:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure
</PRE>

When you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to link in
<CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.

Here is some common environment variables to set depending on
the compiler you are using:

<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>gcc 2.7.2.1 </TD><TD>
CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors"

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

In most cases you can get a reasonably optimal MySQL binary by
using the options from the above and adding the following options to the
configure line: 


<PRE>
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

The full configure line would in other words be something like the
following for all recent gcc versions:


<PRE>
CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

The binaries we provide on the MySQL Web site at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a> are all compiled with full optimization and
should be perfect for most users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.6  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>.  There are some
things you can tweak to make an even faster binary, but this is only for
advanced users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compile_and_link_options">5.5.3  How Compiling and Linking Affects the Speed of MySQL</A>.

If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or linker not
being able to create the shared library <TT>`libmysqlclient.so.#'</TT> (<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
is a version number), you can work around this problem by giving the
<CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>configure</CODE> will not build a shared <CODE>libmysqlclient.so.#</CODE> library.

<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
<LI>

You can configure MySQL not to use <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> column values for
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>).  This causes <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to generate an error
unless you explicitly specify values for all columns that require a
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  To suppress use of default values, run
<CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS ./configure
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<LI>

By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
change the default set, use the <CODE>--with-charset</CODE> option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
</PRE>

<CODE>CHARSET</CODE> may be one of <CODE>big5</CODE>, <CODE>cp1251</CODE>, <CODE>cp1257</CODE>,
<CODE>czech</CODE>, <CODE>danish</CODE>, <CODE>dec8</CODE>, <CODE>dos</CODE>, <CODE>euc_kr</CODE>,
<CODE>gb2312</CODE>, <CODE>gbk</CODE>, <CODE>german1</CODE>, <CODE>hebrew</CODE>, <CODE>hp8</CODE>,
<CODE>hungarian</CODE>, <CODE>koi8_ru</CODE>, <CODE>koi8_ukr</CODE>, <CODE>latin1</CODE>,
<CODE>latin2</CODE>, <CODE>sjis</CODE>, <CODE>swe7</CODE>, <CODE>tis620</CODE>, <CODE>ujis</CODE>,
<CODE>usa7</CODE>, or <CODE>win1251ukr</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

If you want to convert characters between the server and the client,
you should take a look at the <CODE>SET OPTION CHARACTER SET</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> If you change character sets after having created any
tables, you will have to run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q</CODE> on every table. Your
indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if you
install MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure
MySQL to use a different character set and reinstall it.)

With the option <CODE>--with-extra-charset=LIST</CODE> you can define
which additional character sets should be incompiled in the server.

Here <CODE>LIST</CODE> is either a list of character set separated with space,
<CODE>complex</CODE> to include all characters that can't be dynamically loaded
or <CODE>all</CODE> to include all character sets into the binaries.

<LI>

To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>
option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-debug
</PRE>

This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find some errors
and that provides output about what is happening.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">G.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

If your client programs are using threads, you need to also compile a
thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
<CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> configure options. This will create a
<CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE> library with which you should link your threaded
applications.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.7  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.

<LI>

Options that pertain to particular systems can be found in the
system-specific section of this manual.

<TT>`BUILD/'</TT> subdirectory.  If you are lazy, you can use
<TT>`BUILD/compile-pentium-debug'</TT>. To compile on a different architecture,
modify the script removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

<LI>

When the build is done, run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  Be careful with this
on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live release
installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL, we
recommand that you run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with different values for the
<CODE>prefix</CODE>, <CODE>tcp-port</CODE>, and <CODE>unix-socket-path</CODE> options than
those used for your production server.

<LI>

Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new features
crash.  Start by running <CODE>make test</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">9.3.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.

<LI>

If you have gotten to the <CODE>make</CODE> stage and the distribution does
not compile, please report it to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>.  If you
have installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and they
crash trying to process our configuration files, please report that also.
However, if you execute <CODE>aclocal</CODE> and get a <CODE>command not found</CODE>
error or a similar problem, do not report it.  Instead, make sure all
the necessary tools are installed and that your <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable is
set correctly so your shell can find them.

<LI>

After the initial <CODE>bk clone</CODE> operation to get the source tree, you
should run <CODE>bk pull</CODE> periodically to get the updates.

<LI>

You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs by using

on how to do something, send an email to the same address with a patch.
<CODE>bk diffs</CODE> will produce a patch for you after you have made changes
to the source. If you do not have the time to code your idea, just send
a description.

All MySQL programs compile cleanly for us with no warnings on
Solaris using <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  On other systems, warnings may occur due to
differences in system include files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A> for warnings
that may occur when using MIT-pthreads.  For other problems, check the list
below.

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring.  If you do need to
reconfigure, take note of the following:

If <CODE>configure</CODE> is run after it already has been run, it may use
information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This
information is stored in <TT>`config.cache'</TT>.  When <CODE>configure</CODE> starts
up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on the
assumption that the information is still correct.  That assumption is invalid
when you reconfigure.

<LI>

Each time you run <CODE>configure</CODE>, you must run <CODE>make</CODE> again
to recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
builds first, because they were compiled using different configuration options.
</UL>

<P>
To prevent old configuration information or object files from being used,
run these commands before rerunning <CODE>configure</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; make clean
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you can run <CODE>make distclean</CODE>.

The list below describes some of the problems compiling MySQL
that have been found to occur most often:

If you get errors when compiling <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, such as the ones shown
below, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:


<PRE>
Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
  or
Out of virtual memory
  or
Virtual memory exhausted
</PRE>

The problem is that <CODE>gcc</CODE> requires huge amounts of memory to compile
<TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with inline functions.  Try running <CODE>configure</CODE> with
the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-low-memory
</PRE>

This option causes <CODE>-fno-inline</CODE> to be added to the compile line if you
are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and <CODE>-O0</CODE> if you are using something else.  You
should try the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option even if you have so much
memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have run out.  This
problem has been observed to occur even on systems with generous hardware
configurations, and the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option usually fixes it.

<LI>

By default, <CODE>configure</CODE> picks <CODE>c++</CODE> as the compiler name and
GNU <CODE>c++</CODE> links with <CODE>-lg++</CODE>.  If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
that behavior can cause problems during configuration such as this:

<A NAME="IDX260"></A>

<PRE>
configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C++ compiler cannot create executables.
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX261"></A>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
You might also observe problems during compilation related to
<CODE>g++</CODE>, <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.

One cause of these problems is that you may not have <CODE>g++</CODE>, or you may
have <CODE>g++</CODE> but not <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  Take a look at
the <TT>`config.log'</TT> file.  It should contain the exact reason why your c++
compiler didn't work!  To work around these problems, you can use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment variable <CODE>CXX</CODE> to
<CODE>"gcc -O3"</CODE>.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
<A NAME="IDX264"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure
</PRE>

This works because <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiles C++ sources as well as <CODE>g++</CODE>
does, but does not link in <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> by default.

Another way to fix these problems, of course, is to install <CODE>g++</CODE>,
<CODE>libg++</CODE> and <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.

<LI>

If your compile fails with errors, such as any of the following,
you must upgrade your version of <CODE>make</CODE> to GNU <CODE>make</CODE>:


<PRE>
making all in mit-pthreads
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:

  or

If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers, do so by
adding the flags to the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> environment
variables.  You can also specify the compiler names this way using <CODE>CC</CODE>
and <CODE>CXX</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; CXX=gcc
shell&#62; CXXFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.6  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>, for a list of flag definitions that have been found
to be useful on various systems.

<LI>

If you get an error message like this,
you need to upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler:


<PRE>
client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'
</PRE>

<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 or
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.0.3a instead.

<LI>

If you get errors such as those shown below when compiling <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't correctly detect the type of the last argument to
<CODE>accept()</CODE>, <CODE>getsockname()</CODE>, or <CODE>getpeername()</CODE>:


<PRE>
cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
     type of the pointer value "&#38;length" is "unsigned long", which
     is not compatible with "int".
new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&#38;cAddr, &#38;length);
</PRE>

To fix this, edit the <TT>`config.h'</TT> file (which is generated by
<CODE>configure</CODE>).  Look for these lines:


<PRE>
/* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
#define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX
</PRE>

Change <CODE>XXX</CODE> to <CODE>size_t</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>, depending on your
operating system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
<CODE>configure</CODE>, because <CODE>configure</CODE> regenerates <TT>`config.h'</TT>.)

<LI>

The <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> file is generated from <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>.  Normally
the build process doesn't need to create <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, because
MySQL comes with an already-generated copy.  However, if you do need
to re-create it, you might encounter this error:


<PRE>
"sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
</PRE>

This is a sign that your version of <CODE>yacc</CODE> is deficient.
You probably need to install <CODE>bison</CODE> (the GNU version of <CODE>yacc</CODE>)
and use that instead.

<LI>

If you need to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or a MySQL client, run
<CODE>configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option, then recompile and
link your clients with the new client library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_client">G.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A>.

This section describes some of the issues involved in using MIT-pthreads.

Note that on Linux you should NOT use MIT-pthreads but install LinuxThreads!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Linux">2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your system does not provide native thread support, you will need to
build MySQL using the MIT-pthreads package.  This includes
older FreeBSD systems, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.4 and earlier, and some others.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.

<UL>
<LI>

On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
<CODE>configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--with-mit-threads</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-mit-threads
</PRE>

Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
MIT-pthreads, because we want to minimize our changes to this code.

<LI>

The checks that determine whether or not to use MIT-pthreads occur only
during the part of the configuration process that deals with the server
code.  If you have configured the distribution using <CODE>--without-server</CODE>
to build only the client code, clients will not know whether or not
MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix socket connections by default.
Because Unix sockets do not work under MIT-pthreads, this means you will need
to use <CODE>-h</CODE> or <CODE>--host</CODE> when you run client programs.

<LI>

When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the server to use
system locking with the <CODE>--use-locking</CODE> option.

<LI>

Sometimes the pthread <CODE>bind()</CODE> command fails to bind to a socket without
any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is that all connections
to the server fail.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'
</PRE>

The solution to this is to kill the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and restart it.
This has only happened to us when we have forced the server down and done
a restart immediately.

<LI>

With MIT-pthreads, the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> system call isn't interruptible with
<CODE>SIGINT</CODE> (break).  This is only noticeable when you run 
<CODE>mysqladmin --sleep</CODE>.  You must wait for the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> call to
terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

<LI>

When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at least on
Solaris); they can be ignored:


<PRE>
ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
ld: warning: symbol `__iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
</PRE>

<LI>

Some other warnings also can be ignored:


<PRE>
implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'
</PRE>

<LI>

We haven't gotten <CODE>readline</CODE> to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This isn't
needed, but may be interesting for someone.)

Once you've installed MySQL (from either a binary or source
distribution), you need to initialize the grant tables, start the server,
and make sure that the server works okay.  You may also wish to arrange
for the server to be started and stopped automatically when your system
starts up and shuts down.

</P>
<P>
Normally you install the grant tables and start the server like this
for installation from a source distribution:
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
<A NAME="IDX283"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
For a binary distribution (not RPM or pkg packages), do this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./bin/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
This creates the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database which will hold all database
privileges, the <CODE>test</CODE> database which you can use to test
MySQL and also privilege entries for the user that run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and a <CODE>root</CODE> user (without any passwords).
This also starts the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> will not overwrite any old privilege tables, so
it should be safe to run in any circumstances.  If you don't want to
have the <CODE>test</CODE> database you can remove it with <CODE>mysqladmin -u
root drop test</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Testing is most easily done from the top-level directory of the MySQL
distribution.  For a binary distribution, this is your installation directory
(typically something like <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>).  For a source
distribution, this is the main directory of your MySQL source tree.
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the commands shown below in this section and in the following
subsections, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is the path to the location in which programs
like <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> are installed.  For a
binary distribution, this is the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory within the
distribution.  For a source distribution, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>, unless you specified an installation directory
other than <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> when you ran <CODE>configure</CODE>.
<CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is the location in which the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is
installed.  For a binary distribution, this is the same as
<CODE>BINDIR</CODE>.  For a source distribution, <CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT>.

If necessary, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and set up the initial
MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
users are allowed to connect to the server.  This is normally done with the
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Typically, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> needs to be run only the first time you
install MySQL.  Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
installation, you can skip this step.  (However, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is
quite safe to use and will not update any tables that already exist, so if
you are unsure of what to do, you can always run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.)

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> creates six tables (<CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>, and <CODE>func</CODE>) in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  A description of the initial privileges is given in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.  Briefly, these privileges allow the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or use databases
with a name of <CODE>'test'</CODE> or starting with <CODE>'test_'</CODE>.

If you don't set up the grant tables, the following error will appear in the
log file when you start the server:

<A NAME="IDX286"></A>

<PRE>
mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'
</PRE>

The above may also happen with a binary MySQL distribution if you
don't start MySQL by executing exactly <CODE>./bin/safe_mysqld</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

You might need to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE>.  However,
if you prefer, you can run the MySQL server as an unprivileged
(non-<CODE>root</CODE>) user, provided that user can read and write files in
the database directory.  Instructions for running MySQL as an
unprivileged user are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

If you have problems with <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_install_db">2.4.1  Problems Running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE></A>.

There are some alternatives to running the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:


<UL>
<LI>

You may want to edit <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before running it, to change 
the initial privileges that are installed into the grant tables.  This is 
useful if you want to install MySQL on a lot of machines with the 
same privileges.  In this case you probably should need only to add a few 
extra <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
tables!

<LI>

If you want to change things in the grant tables after installing them, you
can run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, then use <CODE>mysql -u root mysql</CODE> to
connect to the grant tables as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user and issue
SQL statements to modify the grant tables directly.

<LI>

It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after they have
already been created.  You might want to do this if you've already installed
the tables but then want to re-create them after editing
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.
</UL>

For more information about these alternatives, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.

<LI>

Start the MySQL server like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

If you have problems starting the server, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> to verify that the server is running.  The following
commands provide a simple test to check that the server is up and responding
to connections:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin version
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

The output from <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE> varies slightly depending on your
platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that shown
below:

<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or
by invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/safe_mysqld --log &#38;

If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> fails, try running it from the MySQL
installation directory (if you are not already there).  If that doesn't work,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

<LI>

Run some simple tests to verify that the server is working.
The output should be similar to what is shown below:

There is also a benchmark suite in the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory (under the
MySQL installation directory) that you can use to compare how
MySQL performs on different platforms.  The <TT>`sql-bench/Results'</TT>
directory contains the results from many runs against different databases and
platforms.  To run all tests, execute these commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd sql-bench
shell&#62; run-all-tests
</PRE>

If you don't have the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory, you are probably using an
RPM for a binary distribution.  (Source distribution RPMs include the
benchmark directory.)  In this case, you must first install the benchmark
suite before you can use it.  Beginning with MySQL Version 3.22,
there are benchmark RPM files named <TT>`mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm'</TT> that
contain benchmark code and data.

If you have a source distribution, you can also run the tests in the
<TT>`tests'</TT> subdirectory. For example, to run <TT>`auto_increment.tst'</TT>, do
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysql -vvf test &#60; ./tests/auto_increment.tst
</PRE>

The expected results are shown in the <TT>`./tests/auto_increment.res'</TT> file.

It will also not do anything if you already have MySQL privilege
tables installed!

</P>
<P>
If you want to re-create your privilege tables, you should take down
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, if it's running, and then do something like:

</P>

<PRE>
mv mysql-data-directory/mysql mysql-data-directory/mysql-old
mysql_install_db
</PRE>

<P>
This section lists problems you might encounter when you run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> doesn't install the grant tables</STRONG>
<DD>
You may find that <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> fails to install the grant
tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:


<PRE>
starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
mysql daemon ended
</PRE>

In this case, you should examine the log file very carefully!  The log
should be located in the directory <TT>`XXXXXX'</TT> named by the error message,
and should indicate why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> didn't start.  If you don't understand
what happened, include the log when you post a bug report using
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<DT><STRONG>There is already a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon running</STRONG>
<DD>
In this case, you probably don't have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> at
all.  You have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> only once, when you install
MySQL the first time.

<DT><STRONG>Installing a second <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon doesn't work when one daemon is running</STRONG>
<DD>
This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL
installation, but want to put a new installation in a different place (for
example, for testing, or perhaps you simply want to run two installations at
the same time).  Generally the problem that occurs when you try to run the
second server is that it tries to use the same socket and port as the old one.
In this case you will get the error message: <CODE>Can't start server: Bind on
TCP/IP port: Address already in use</CODE> or <CODE>Can't start server : Bind on
unix socket...</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_many_servers">4.1.3  Installing Many Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

<DT><STRONG>You don't have write access to <TT>`/tmp'</TT></STRONG>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX293"></A>
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>

If you don't have write access to create a socket file at the default place
(in <TT>`/tmp'</TT>) or permission to create temporary files in <TT>`/tmp,'</TT>
you will get an error when running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> or when
starting or using <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

You can specify a different socket and temporary directory as follows:

<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
shell&#62; MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysqld.sock
shell&#62; export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or change the MySQL socket file <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

<TT>`some_tmp_dir'</TT> should be the path to some directory for which you
have write permission. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.

After this you should be able to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and start
the server with these commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; BINDIR/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes immediately</STRONG>
<DD>
If you are running RedHat Version 5.0 with a version of <CODE>glibc</CODE> older than
2.0.7-5, you should make sure you have installed all <CODE>glibc</CODE> patches!
There is a lot of information about this in the MySQL mail
archives.  Links to the mail archives are available online at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/</a>.
Also, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Linux">2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A>.

You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> manually using the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
option and add the privilege information yourself using <CODE>mysql</CODE>:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/safe_mysqld --skip-grant-tables &#38;
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysql -u root mysql
</PRE>

From <CODE>mysql</CODE>, manually execute the SQL commands in
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  Make sure you run <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE> afterward to tell the server to
reload the grant tables.

<H3><A NAME="Starting_server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are going to use tables that support transactions (BDB, InnoDB), 
you should first create a my.cnf file and set startup options
for the table types you plan to use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
Generally, you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in one of three ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.  This script is used primarily at
system startup and shutdown, and is described more fully in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, which tries to determine the proper options
for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and then runs it with those options. See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

<LI>

On NT you should install <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service as follows:

<PRE>
bin\mysqld-nt --install               # Install MySQL as a service
</PRE>

You can now start/stop <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as follows:

<PRE>
NET START mysql
NET STOP mysql
</PRE>

Note that in this case you can't use any other options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!

You can remove the service as follows:

<PRE>
bin\mysqld-nt --remove                # remove MySQL as a service
</PRE>

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.
</UL>

<P>
When the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon starts up, it changes directory to the
data directory.  This is where it expects to write log files and the pid
(process ID) file, and where it expects to find databases.

</P>
<P>
The data directory location is hardwired in when the distribution is
compiled.  However, if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> expects to find the data directory
somewhere other than where it really is on your system, it will not work
properly.  If you have problems with incorrect paths, you can find out
what options <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allows and what the default path settings are by
invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.  You can override the
defaults by specifying the correct pathnames as command-line arguments to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  (These options can be used with <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as well.)

</P>
<P>
Normally you should need to tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> only the base directory under
which MySQL is installed.  You can do this with the <CODE>--basedir</CODE>
option.  You can also use <CODE>--help</CODE> to check the effect of changing path
options (note that <CODE>--help</CODE> <EM>must</EM> be the final option of the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> command).  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; EXECDIR/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --help
</PRE>

<P>
Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary distribution,
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source distribution,
<TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> on Windows.)  Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form <TT>`host_name.err'</TT> and
<TT>`host_name.log'</TT> where <CODE>host_name</CODE> is the name of your server
host.  Then check the last few lines of these files:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; tail host_name.err
shell&#62; tail host_name.log
</PRE>

<P>
If you find something like the following in the log file:

<PRE>
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  Recovery function for LSN 1 27595 failed
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  warning: ./test/t1.db: No such file or directory
000729 14:50:10  Can't init databases
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you didn't start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>
and Berkeley DB found something wrong with its log files when it
tried to recover your databases.  To be able to continue, you should
move away the old Berkeley DB log file from the database directory to
some other place, where you can later examine these.  The log files are
named <TT>`log.0000000001'</TT>, where the number will increase over time.

</P>
<P>
If you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with BDB table support and <CODE>mysqld</CODE> core
dumps at start this could be because of some problems with the BDB
recover log.  In this case you can try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>.  If this helps, then you should remove all
<TT>`log.*'</TT> files from the data directory and try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
again.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error, it means that some other program (or another
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) is already using the TCP/IP port or socket
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use:

</P>

<PRE>
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
  or
Can't start server : Bind on unix socket...
</PRE>

<P>
Use <CODE>ps</CODE> to make sure that you don't have another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
running.  If you can't find another server running, you can try to execute
the command <CODE>telnet your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press
<CODE>RETURN</CODE> a couple of times.  If you don't get an error message like
<CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused</CODE>,
something is using the TCP/IP port <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_install_db">2.4.1  Problems Running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE></A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Multiple_servers">4.1.4  Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'your-host-name' variables
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> starts the server but you can't connect to it,
you should make sure you have an entry in <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> that looks like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<P>
This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

</P>
<P>
If you can't get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to start you can try to make a trace file
to find the problem. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using InnoDB tables, refer to the InnoDB-specific startup
options.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.6.2  InnoDB startup options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using BDB (Berkeley DB) tables, you should familiarize
yourself with the different BDB specific startup options.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB_start">7.5.3  BDB startup options</A>.

The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> scripts can be used to start
the server automatically at system startup time. <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can also
be used to stop the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script can be used to start or stop the server
by invoking it with <CODE>start</CODE> or <CODE>stop</CODE> arguments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql.server start
shell&#62; mysql.server stop
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`share/mysql'</TT> directory
under the MySQL installation directory or in the <TT>`support-files'</TT>
directory of the MySQL source tree.

</P>
<P>
Before <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> starts the server, it changes directory to
the MySQL installation directory, then invokes <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
You might need to edit <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> if you have a binary distribution
that you've installed in a non-standard location.  Modify it to <CODE>cd</CODE> 
into the proper directory before it runs <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>. If you want the
server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate <CODE>user</CODE> line
to the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> file, as shown later in this section.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql.server stop</CODE> brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can take down the server manually by executing <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You might want to add these start and stop commands to the appropriate places
in your <TT>`/etc/rc*'</TT> files when you start using MySQL for
production applications.  Note that if you modify <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>, then
upgrade MySQL sometime, your modified version will be overwritten,
so you should make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.

</P>
<P>
If your system uses <TT>`/etc/rc.local'</TT> to start external scripts, you
should append the following to it:

<PRE>
/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql ; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
You can also add options for <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> in a global

You can always move the MySQL form and data files between
different versions on the same architecture as long as you have the same
base version of MySQL. The current base version is
3. If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may
also change the sort order), you must run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q</CODE> on all
tables.  Otherwise your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

</P>
<P>
If you are afraid of new versions, you can always rename your old
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to something like <CODE>mysqld</CODE>-'old-version-number'.  If
your new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> then does something unexpected, you can simply shut it
down and restart with your old <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!

</P>
<P>
When you do an upgrade you should also back up your old databases, of course.

</P>
<P>
If after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client programs,
like <CODE>Commands out of sync</CODE> or unexpected core dumps, you probably have
used an old header or library file when compiling your programs.  In this
case you should check the date for your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file and
<TT>`libmysqlclient.a'</TT> library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs!

</P>
<P>
If you get some problems that the new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, check that you don't
have some old <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file from your old installation!  You can
check this with: <CODE>program-name --print-defaults</CODE>.  If this outputs
anything other than the program name, you have an active <CODE>my.cnf</CODE>
file that will affect things!

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE>
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as all your <CODE>DBI</CODE> scripts
dumping core after you upgrade MySQL.

<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
<A NAME="IDX309"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> type and
the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE> type.  You don't have to convert your old tables to
use these with Version 3.23.  By default, all new tables will be created with
type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> (unless you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the
<CODE>--default-table-type=isam</CODE> option). You can change an <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
table to a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table with <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM</CODE>
or the Perl script <CODE>mysql_convert_table_format</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a Version
3.23 server.

</P>
<P>
The following lists tell what you have to watch out for when upgrading to
Version 3.23:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All tables that uses the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set must be fixed
with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

If you do a <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> on a symbolic linked database, both the
link and the original database is deleted.  (This didn't happen in 3.22
because configure didn't detect the <CODE>readlink</CODE> system call).

<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> now only works for <STRONG>MyISAM</STRONG> tables.
For other table types, you can use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to optimize the table.
During <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> the table is now locked from other threads.

<LI>

The MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> is now by default started with the
option <CODE>--no-named-commands (-g)</CODE>. This option can be disabled with
<CODE>--enable-named-commands (-G)</CODE>. This may cause incompatibility problems in
some cases, for example in SQL scripts that use named commands without a
semicolon!  Long format commands still work from the first line.

<LI>

If you are using the <CODE>german</CODE> character sort order, you must repair
all your tables with <CODE>isamchk -r</CODE>, as we have made some changes in
the sort order!

<LI>

The default return type of <CODE>IF</CODE> will now depend on both arguments
and not only the first argument.

<LI>

<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> will not work with negative numbers. The reason
for this is that negative numbers caused problems when wrapping from -1 to 0.
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> is now for MyISAM tables handled at a lower level and
is much faster than before. For MyISAM tables old numbers are also not reused
anymore, even if you delete some rows from the table.

<LI>

<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>, <CODE>ELSE</CODE>, <CODE>END</CODE>, <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>, 
<CODE>INNER</CODE>, <CODE>RIGHT</CODE>, <CODE>THEN</CODE> and <CODE>WHEN</CODE> are now reserved words.

<LI>

<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a 
fixed number of decimals.

<LI>

When declaring <CODE>DECIMAL(length,dec)</CODE> the length argument no longer 
includes a place for the sign or the decimal point.

<LI>

A <CODE>TIME</CODE> string must now be of one of the following formats:
<CODE>[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]</CODE> or
<CODE>[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]</CODE>

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> now compares strings using the same character comparison rules 
as <CODE>'='</CODE>.  If you require the old behavior, you can compile 
MySQL with the <CODE>CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER</CODE> flag.

<LI>

<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is now case insensitive for normal (not binary) strings.

<LI>

When you check/repair tables you should use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (<CODE>.MYI</CODE>) and
<CODE>isamchk</CODE> for ISAM (<CODE>.ISM</CODE>) tables.

<LI>

If you want your <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> files to be compatible between
MySQL Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the
<CODE>--opt</CODE> or <CODE>--full</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

<LI>

Check all your calls to <CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> to make sure there is a
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before each format character.  (Later MySQL Version 3.22
did allow this syntax.)

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_fetch_fields_direct</CODE> is now a function (it was a macro) and
it returns a pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> can no longer be used on a <CODE>MYSQL*</CODE> object (it's
now a function that takes <CODE>MYSQL_RES*</CODE> as an argument. You should now
use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT ...</CODE> was
almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> to obtain sorted output.

<LI>

<CODE>SUM()</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>, instead of 0, if there is no matching
rows. This is according to ANSI SQL.

<LI>

An <CODE>AND</CODE> or <CODE>OR</CODE> with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values will now return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of 0. This mostly affects queries that use <CODE>NOT</CODE>
on an <CODE>AND/OR</CODE> expression as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> = <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<CODE>LPAD()</CODE> and <CODE>RPAD()</CODE> will shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.21" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.21">2.5.2  Upgrading from Version 3.21 to Version 3.22</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>

</P>
<P>
Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between Version 3.21 and 3.22.
The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with <CODE>DATE</CODE> type
columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't access these new
fields from an old version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.  If you forget
this, you will get <CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you try to use <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>, or <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE>. If your MySQL root
user requires a password, you should give this as an argument to
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The C API interface to <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a <CODE>0</CODE> for
the new <CODE>db</CODE> argument (or recode the client to send the <CODE>db</CODE>
element for faster connections).  You must also call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>
before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>!  This change was done to allow
the new <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> function to save options in the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
handler structure.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variable <CODE>key_buffer</CODE> has changed names to
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>, but you can still use the old name in your
startup files.

If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

</P>
<P>
You can start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Version 3.21 server with <CODE>safe_mysqld
--old-protocol</CODE> to use it with clients from a Version 3.20 distribution.
In this case, the new client function <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> will not
return any server error, only <CODE>CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR</CODE> (but it
works for client errors), and the server uses the old <CODE>password()</CODE>
checking rather than the new one.

</P>
<P>
If you are <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will need to make the following changes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you must get
the new <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> 2.x driver.
<LI>

The script <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> must be run to convert the
<CODE>Password</CODE> field in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table to <CODE>CHAR(16)</CODE>.
<LI>

All passwords must be reassigned in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table (to get 62-bit
rather than 31-bit passwords).
<LI>

The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any tables.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new <CODE>user</CODE> table
format without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier
than Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert the
<CODE>user</CODE> table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least Version
3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
The new client code works with a 3.20.x <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, so
if you experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
old clients will issue the error message:

</P>

<PRE>
ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9
</PRE>

<P>
The new Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface also supports the old
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> interface.  The only change you have to make if you use
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> is to change the arguments to the <CODE>connect()</CODE> function.
The new arguments are: <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>database</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE>,
<CODE>password</CODE> (the <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>password</CODE> arguments have changed
places).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_DBI_Class">8.2.2  The <CODE>DBI</CODE> Interface</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> must now be specified before any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.
<LI>

The parameters to <CODE>LOCATE()</CODE> have been swapped.
<LI>

There are some new reserved words. The most notable are <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-to-arch" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-to-arch">2.5.4  Upgrading to Another Architecture</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23, you can copy the <CODE>.frm</CODE>,
<CODE>.MYI</CODE>, and <CODE>.MYD</CODE> files between different architectures that
support the same floating-point format.  (MySQL takes care of any
byte swapping issues.)

</P>
<P>
The MySQL <CODE>ISAM</CODE> data and index files (<TT>`.ISD'</TT> and
<TT>`*.ISM'</TT>, respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases
OS-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another machine
that has a different architecture or OS than your current machine, you
should not try to move a database by simply copying the files to the
other machine. Use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create a file full of SQL statements.
You can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input
to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.

</P>
<P>
Try <CODE>mysqldump --help</CODE> to see what options are available.
If you are moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use
<CODE>mysqldump --opt</CODE> with the newer version to get a fast, compact dump.

</P>
<P>
The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between two
machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which the
database is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump --opt db_name \
        | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow network,
you can use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
        | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip &#62; db_name.contents.gz
</PRE>

<P>
(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these commands
there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
You can also use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to accomplish
the database transfer.
For big tables, this is much faster than simply using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
In the commands shown below, <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> represents the full pathname
of the directory you use to store the output from <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mkdir DUMPDIR
shell&#62; mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name
</PRE>

<P>
Then transfer the files in the <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL
there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
shell&#62; cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
shell&#62; mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables
</PRE>

<P>
Also, don't forget to copy the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database, because that's where the
grant tables (<CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, <CODE>host</CODE>) are stored.  You may have
to run commands as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user on the new machine
until you have the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database in place.

</P>
<P>
After you import the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database on the new machine, execute
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> so that the server reloads the grant table
information.

</P>

<H3><A NAME="Linux" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux">2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A></H3>

<P>
The notes below regarding <STRONG>glibc</STRONG> apply only to the situation
when you build MySQL
yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine, in most cases it is
much better for you to just use our binary. We link our binaries against
the best patched version of <STRONG>glibc</STRONG> we can come up with and with the
best compiler options, in an attempt to make it suitable for a high-load
server. So if you read the text below, and are in doubt about
what you should do, try our binary first to see if it meets your needs, and
worry about your own build only after you have discovered that our binary is
not good enough. In that case, we would appreciate a note about it, so we
can build a better binary next time. For a typical user, even for setups with
a lot of concurrent connections and/or tables exceeding 2GB limit, our
binary in most cases is the best choice. 

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old
Linux version that doesn't have <CODE>glibc2</CODE>, you must install
LinuxThreads before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get 
LinuxThreads at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux</a>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> We have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and
MySQL on SMP systems; If you have a SMP system, we recommend
you to upgrade to Linux 2.4 ASAP!  Your system will be faster and more
stable by doing this!

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>glibc</CODE> versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have
a fatal bug in <CODE>pthread_mutex_timedwait</CODE> handling, which is used
when you do <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  We recommend you to not use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> before upgrading glibc.

</P>
<P>
If you plan to have 1000+ concurrent connections, you will need to make
some changes to LinuxThreads, recompile it, and relink MySQL against
the new <TT>`libpthread.a'</TT>.  Increase <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE> in
<TT>`sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h'</TT> to 4096 and decrease
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in <TT>`linuxthreads/internals.h'</TT> to 256 KB. The paths are
relative to the root of <CODE>glibc</CODE> Note that MySQL will not be 
stable with around 600-1000 connections if <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> is the default 
of 2 MB.

</P>
<P>
If you have a problem with that MySQL can't open enough files,
or connections, it may be that you haven't configured Linux to handle
enough files.

</P>
<P>
In Linux 2.2 and forwards, you can check the number of allocated
file handlers by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max 
cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
If you have more than 16M of memory, you should add something like the
following in your boot script (<TT>`/etc/rc/boot.local'</TT> on SuSE):

</P>

<PRE>
echo 65536 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo 8192 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
echo 1024 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
You can also run the above from the command line as root, but in this case
your old limits will be used next time your computer reboots.

</P>
<P>
You should also add /etc/my.cnf:

</P>

<PRE>
[safe_mysqld]
open-files-limit=8192
</PRE>

<P>
The above should allow MySQL to create up to 8192 connections + files.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there will
be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but small enough
to keep the stack of some thread from running into the global <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
data.  Unfortunately, the Linux implementation of <CODE>mmap()</CODE>, as we have
experimentally discovered, will successfully unmap an already mapped region
if you ask it to map out an address already in use, zeroing out the data
on the entire page, instead of returning an error.  So, the safety of
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> or any other threaded application depends on the "gentleman" 
behavior of the code that creates threads.  The user must take measures to 
make sure the number of running threads at any time is sufficiently low for 
thread stacks to stay away from the global heap.  With <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you 
should enforce this "gentleman" behavior by setting a reasonable value for 
the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
If you build MySQL yourself and do not want to mess with patching
LinuxThreads, you should set <CODE>max_connections</CODE> to a value no higher 
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large 
heap tables, or some other things that make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allocate a lot 
of memory or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2GB patch. If you are 
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables 
with lots of data.  The more you reduce <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in LinuxThreads 
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend the values between 
128K and 256K.

</P>
<P>
If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a "feature" 
in the 2.2 kernel that penalizes a process for forking or cloning a child
in an attempt to prevent a fork bomb attack.  This will cause MySQL
not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent clients.  On
single CPU systems, we have seen this manifested in a very slow thread
creation, which means it may take a long time to connect to MySQL
(as long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it down.  On
multiple CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in query speed as
the number of clients increases.  In the process of trying to find a
solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of our users, who
claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The patch is available here
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch</a>). We have
now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both development and
production systems.  It has significantly
improved <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performance without causing any problems and we now
recommend it to our users who are still running high-load servers on
2.2 kernels.  This issue has been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not
satisfied with
the current performance of your system, rather than patching your 2.2 kernel,
it might be easier to just upgrade to 2.4, which will also give you a nice
SMP boost in addition to fixing this fairness bug.

</P>
<P>
We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2 CPU machine and
found MySQL scales MUCH better - there was virtually no slowdown
on query throughput all the way up
to 1000 clients, and MySQL scaling factor ( computed as the ratio of
maximum throughput to the throughput with one client) was 180%.
We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system - virtually no
slowdown as the number of
clients was increased up to 1000, and 300% scaling factor. So for a high-load
SMP server we would definitely recommend the 2.4 kernel at this point. We
have discovered that it is essential to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process with the
highest possible priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum performance.
This can be done by adding
<CODE>renice -20 $$</CODE> command to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>. In our testing on a
4-CPU machine, increasing the priority gave 60% increase in throughput with
400 clients.

</P>
<P>
We are currently also trying to collect
more info on how well <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way
systems. If you have access such a system and have done some benchmarks,
please send a mail to <a HREF="mailto:docs@mysql.com">docs@mysql.com</a> with the results - we will
include them in the manual.

</P>
<P>
There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance,
especially on SMP systems.  The implementation of mutex in
LinuxThreads in <STRONG>glibc-2.1</STRONG> is very bad for programs with many
threads that only
hold the mutex for a short time. On an SMP system, ironic as it is, if
you link MySQL against unmodified <STRONG>LinuxThreads</STRONG>,
removing processors from the machine improves MySQL performance
in many cases.  We have made a patch available for <STRONG>glibc 2.1.3</STRONG>,
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch">linuxthreads-2.1-patch</a>
to correct this behavior.

</P>
<P>
With <STRONG>glibc-2.2.2</STRONG>
MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex, which is much
better than even the patched one in <STRONG>glibc-2.1.3</STRONG>. Be warned, however,
that under some conditions, the current mutex code in <STRONG>glibc-2.2.2</STRONG>
overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The chance of this
condition can be reduced by renicing <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process to the highest
priority. We have also been able to correct the overspin behavior with
a patch, available <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch">here</a>. It combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of
threads, and stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
<CODE>linuxthreads</CODE> directory with
<CODE>patch -p0 &#60;/tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch</CODE>.
We hope it will be included in
some form in to the future releases of <CODE>glibc-2.2</CODE>. In any case, if
you link against <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE> you still need to correct
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> and <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE>. We hope that the defaults
will be corrected to some more acceptable values for high-load
MySQL setup in the future, so that your own build can be reduced
to <CODE>./configure; make; make install</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that you use the above patches to build a special static
version of <CODE>libpthread.a</CODE> and use it only for statically linking
against <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. We know that the patches are safe for <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
and significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything
about other applications. If you link other applications against the
patched version of the library, or build a patched shared version and
install it on your system, you are doing it at your own risk with regard
to other applications that depend on <CODE>LinuxThreads</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilties hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using our
binary will resolve them.

</P>
<P>
One known problem with the binary distribution is that with older Linux
systems that use <CODE>libc</CODE> (like RedHat 4.x or Slackware), you will get
some non-fatal problems with hostname resolution.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_notes-Linux">2.6.1.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three processes
running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one thread for the
LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections, and one thread
to handle alarms and signals.

</P>
<P>
Note that the Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default
only have 1024 threads.  This means that you can only have up to 1021
connections to MySQL on an unpatched system.  The page
<a HREF="http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html">http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html</a> contains information how to
go around this limit.

</P>
<P>
If you see a dead <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon process with <CODE>ps</CODE>, this usually
means that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a SIGSEGV
signal, you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.  Note
that you also probably need to raise the <CODE>core file size</CODE> by adding
<CODE>ulimit -c 1000000</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or starting <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
with <CODE>--core-file-sizes=1000000</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are linking your own MySQL client and get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.4: open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
When executing them, the problem can be avoided by one of the following
methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/path-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <CODE>libmysqclient.so</CODE> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <CODE>libmysqlclient.so</CODE> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using the Fujitsu compiler <CODE>(fcc / FCC)</CODE> you will have
some problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very
<CODE>gcc</CODE> oriented.

</P>

MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

</P>
<P>
The binary release is linked with <CODE>-static</CODE>, which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
<CODE>-static</CODE> is slightly bigger than a dynamically linked program but
also slightly faster (3-5%).  One problem, however, is that you can't use
user-definable functions (UDFs) with a statically linked program.  If
you are going to write or use UDF functions (this is something only for
C or C++ programmers), you must compile MySQL yourself, using
dynamic linking.

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>libc</CODE>-based system (instead of a <CODE>glibc2</CODE>
system), you will probably get some problems with hostname resolving and
<CODE>getpwnam()</CODE> with the binary release. (This is because <CODE>glibc</CODE>
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to resolve hostnames
and <CODE>getpwent()</CODE>, even when compiled with <CODE>-static</CODE>). In this
case you probably get the following error message when you run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up
</PRE>

<P>
or the following error when you try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--user</CODE>
option:

</P>

<PRE>
getpwnam: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
You can solve this problem in one of the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the <CODE>tar.gz</CODE>
distribution) and install this instead.
<LI>

Execute <CODE>mysql_install_db --force</CODE>; This will not execute the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  The downside is that
you can't use host names in the grant tables; you must use IP numbers
instead (except for <CODE>localhost</CODE>).  If you are using an old MySQL
release that doesn't support <CODE>--force</CODE>, you have to remove the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install</CODE> with an editor.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>su</CODE> instead of using <CODE>--user</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured
for the highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest
stable compiler available.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support requires Version Perl 5.004_03 or newer.

</P>
<P>
On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error <CODE>Resource
temporarily unavailable</CODE> when you do a lot of new connections to a
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server over TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
The problem is that Linux has a delay between when you close a TCP/IP
socket and until this is actually freed by the system.  As there is only
room for a finite number of TCP/IP slots, you will get the above error if
you try to do too many new TCP/IP connections during a small time, like
when you run the MySQL <TT>`test-connect'</TT> benchmark over
TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
We have mailed about this problem a couple of times to different Linux
mailing lists but have never been able to resolve this properly.

</P>
<P>
The only known 'fix' to this problem is to use persistent connections in
your clients or use sockets, if you are running the database server
and clients on the same machine.  We hope that the <CODE>Linux 2.4</CODE>
kernel will fix this problem in the future.

</P>

MySQL requires <CODE>libc</CODE> Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to
work with <CODE>libc</CODE> 5.4.46.  <CODE>glibc</CODE> Version 2.0.6 and later should
also work. There have been some problems with the <CODE>glibc</CODE> RPMs from
RedHat, so if you have problems, check whether or not there are any updates!
The <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

On some older Linux distributions, <CODE>configure</CODE> may produce an error

<TT>`support-files'</TT> directory of the MySQL source tree.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> always core dumps when it starts up, the problem may be that
you have an old <TT>`/lib/libc.a'</TT>.  Try renaming it, then remove
<TT>`sql/mysqld'</TT> and do a new <CODE>make install</CODE> and try again.  This
problem has been reported on some Slackware installations.

<P>
In some implementations, <CODE>readdir_r()</CODE> is broken.  The symptom is that

<P>
MySQL Version 3.23.12 is the first MySQL version that is
tested on Linux-Alpha.  If you plan to use MySQL on Linux-Alpha, 
you should ensure that you have this version or newer.

</P>
<P>
We have tested MySQL on Alpha with our benchmarks and test suite,
and it appears to work nicely.  The main thing we haven't yet had time to
test is how things works with many concurrent users.

</P>
<P>
When we compiled the standard MySQL binary we are using SuSE 6.4,
kernel 2.2.13-SMP, Compaq C compiler (V6.2-504) and Compaq C++ compiler
(V6.3-005) on a Comaq DS20 machine with an Alpha EV6 processor.

</P>
<P>
You can find the above compilers at 
<a HREF="http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools">http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools</a>).  By using these compilers,
instead of gcc, we get about 9-14 % better performance with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Note that the configure line optimized the binary for the current CPU; This
means you can only use our binary if you have an Alpha EV6 processor. We also
compile statically to avoid library problems.

Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with
<CODE>gdb 4.18</CODE>.  You should download and use gdb 5.0 instead!

<LI>

If you try linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> statically when using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, the
resulting image will core dump at start.  In other words, <STRONG>DON'T</STRONG>
use <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.
</UL>

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-MIPS" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-MIPS">2.6.1.6  Linux MIPS Notes</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to work on Qube2, (Linux Mips), you need the

work).  You must also use the <CODE>egcs</CODE> C++ compiler
(<CODE>egcs-1.0.2-9</CODE>, <CODE>gcc 2.95.2</CODE> or newer).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-IA64" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-IA64">2.6.1.7  Linux IA64 Notes</A></H4>

</PRE>

<P>
On Ia64 the MySQL client binaries are using shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution in some other place than
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> you need to either modify <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT>
or add the path to the directory where you have <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT>

<H4><A NAME="Win95_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#Win95_start">2.6.2.1  Starting MySQL on Windows 95 or Windows 98</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL uses TCP/IP to connect a client to a server. (This will
allow any machine on your network to connect to your MySQL
server.)  Because of this, you must install TCP/IP on your machine before
starting MySQL.  You can find TCP/IP on your Windows CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using an old Win95 release (for example OSR2), it's
likely that you have an old Winsock package!  MySQL requires
Winsock 2!  You can get the newest Winsock from 
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a>.  Win98 has the new Winsock 2 library, so 
the above doesn't apply for Win98.

</P>
<P>
To start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, you should start an MS-DOS window and type:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld
</PRE>

<P>
This will start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the background without a window.

</P>
<P>
You can kill the MySQL server by executing:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
Note that Win95 and Win98 don't support creation of named pipes.
On Win95 and Win98, you can only use named pipes to connect to a
remote MySQL server running on a Windows NT server host.
(The MySQL server must also support named pipes, of
course. For example, using <CODE>mysqld-opt</CODE> under NT will not allow
named pipe connections.  You should use either <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> or
<CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't start, please check the
<TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> file to see if the server wrote any message
there to indicate the cause of the problem.  You can also try to start
the server with <CODE>mysqld --standalone</CODE>;  In this case, you may get
some useful information on the screen that may help solve the problem.

</P>
<P>
The last option is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--standalone
--debug</CODE>.  In this case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a log file
<TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> that should contain the reason why <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
doesn't start. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="NT_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#NT_start">2.6.2.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000</A></H4>

<P>
The Win95/Win98 section also applies to MySQL on NT/Win2000, with
the following differences:

</P>
<P>
To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on NT, you must install
service pack 3 (or newer)!

</P>
<P>
Note that everything in the following that applies for NT also applies
for Win2000!

</P>
<P>
For NT/Win2000, the server name is <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>.  Normally you
should install MySQL as a service on NT/Win2000:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --install
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max-nt --install
</PRE>

<P>
(Under Windows NT, you can actually install any of the server binaries
as a service, but only those having names that end with <CODE>-nt.exe</CODE>
provide support for named pipes.)

</P>
<P>
You can start and stop the MySQL service with these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; NET START mysql
C:\&#62; NET STOP mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in this case you can't use any other options for <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>!

</P>
<P>
You can also run <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> as a stand-alone program on NT if you need
to start <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> with any options!  If you start <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>
without options on NT, <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> tries to start itself as a service
with the default service options.  If you have stopped <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>, you
have to start it with <CODE>NET START mysql</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The service is installed with the name <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. Once installed, it must
be started using the Services Control Manager (SCM) Utility found in the
Control Panel, or by using the <CODE>NET START MySQL</CODE> command.  If any options
are desired, they must be specified as ``Startup parameters'' in the SCM utility
before you start the MySQL service.  Once running, <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>
can be stopped using <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, or from the SCM utility or by using
the command <CODE>NET STOP MySQL</CODE>. If you use SCM to stop <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE>,
there is a strange message from SCM about <CODE>mysqld shutdown normally</CODE>.
When run as a service, <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> has no access to a console and so no
messages can be seen.

</P>
<P>
On NT you can get the following service error messages:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>Permission Denied </TD><TD> Means that it cannot find <CODE>mysqld-nt.exe</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Cannot Register </TD><TD> Means that the path is incorrect.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Failed to install service. </TD><TD> Means that the service is already installed or that the Service Control Manager is in bad state.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
If you have problems installing <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> as a service, try starting
it with the full path:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --install
</PRE>

<P>
If this doesn't work, you can get <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> to start properly by fixing
the path in the registry!

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to start <CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> as a service, you can start it as
follows:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --standalone --debug
</PRE>

MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms and named pipes on NT.
The default is to use named pipes for local connections on NT and TCP/IP for
all other cases if the client has TCP/IP installed.  The host name specifies
which protocol is used:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<STRONG>Host name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Protocol</STRONG>
<TR><TD>NULL (none) </TD><TD> On NT, try named pipes first; if that doesn't work, use TCP/IP. On Win95/Win98, TCP/IP is used.

<TR><TD>. </TD><TD> Named pipes
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>localhost </TD><TD> TCP/IP to current host
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>hostname </TD><TD> TCP/IP
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You can force a MySQL client to use named pipes by specifying the
<CODE>--pipe</CODE> option or by specifying <CODE>.</CODE> as the host name.  Use the 
<CODE>--socket</CODE> option to specify the name of the pipe.

</P>
<P>
Note that starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is
started with with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.  This is because some users
have experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when one uses
named pipes.

</P>
<P>
You can test whether or not MySQL is working by executing the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql test
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is slow to answer to connections on Win95/Win98, there is
probably a problem with your DNS.  In this case, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> and use only <CODE>localhost</CODE> and IP numbers in
the MySQL grant tables.  You can also avoid DNS when connecting to a
<CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> MySQL server running on NT by using the
<CODE>--pipe</CODE> argument to specify use of named pipes.  This works for most
MySQL clients.

</P>
<P>
There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled on native Windows, which offers very limited text editing capabilities.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqlc</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries, which offers <CODE>readline</CODE> editing.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
If you want to use <CODE>mysqlc.exe</CODE>, you must copy
<TT>`C:\mysql\lib\cygwinb19.dll'</TT> to your Windows system directory
(<TT>`\windows\system'</TT> or similar place).

</P>
<P>
The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges
to all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL
more secure, you should set a password for all users and remove the row in
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table that has <CODE>Host='localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User=''</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also add a password for the <CODE>root</CODE> user. The following 
example starts by removing the anonymous user that can be used by anyone
to access the <CODE>test</CODE> database, then sets a <CODE>root</CODE> user password:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql mysql
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
mysql&#62; QUIT
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin reload
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password your_password
</PRE>

<P>
After you've set the password, if you want to take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, you can do so using this command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; mysqladmin --user=root --password=your_password shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using the old shareware version of MySQL Version
3.21 under Windows, the above command will fail with an error:
<CODE>parse error near 'SET OPTION password'</CODE>.  The fix is in to upgrade
to the current MySQL version, which is freely available.

</P>
<P>
With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users
and change privileges with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Here is a note about how to connect to get a secure connection to remote 
MySQL server with SSH (by David Carlson <a HREF="mailto:dcarlson@mplcomm.com">dcarlson@mplcomm.com</a>):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Install an SSH client on your Windows machine.  As a user, the best non-free
one I've found is from <CODE>SecureCRT</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/">http://www.vandyke.com/</a>.
Another option is <CODE>f-secure</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/">http://www.f-secure.com/</a>. You
can also find some free ones on <STRONG>Google</STRONG> at
<a HREF="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/">http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/</a>.

<LI>

Start your Windows SSH client. 
Set <CODE>Host_Name = yourmysqlserver_URL_or_IP</CODE>. 
Set <CODE>userid=your_userid</CODE> to log in to your server (probably not the same
as your MySQL login/password.

<LI>

Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (Set <CODE>local_port: 3306</CODE>, <CODE>remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip</CODE>, <CODE>remote_port: 3306</CODE> )
or a local forward (Set <CODE>port: 3306</CODE>,  <CODE>host: localhost</CODE>, <CODE>remote port: 3306</CODE>).

<LI>

Save everything, otherwise you'll have to redo it the next time.

<LI>

Log in to your server with SSH session you just created.

<LI>

On your Windows machine, start some ODBC application (such as Access).

<LI>

Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC
driver the same way you normally do, EXCEPT type in <CODE>localhost</CODE>
for the MySQL host server -- not <CODE>yourmysqlservername</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
You should now have an ODBC connection to MySQL, encrypted using SSH.

<P>
Beginning with MySQL Version 3.23.16, the <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>
and <CODE>mysql-max-nt</CODE> servers in the MySQL distribution are
compiled with the <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE> option.  This allows you to put a
database on different disk by adding a symbolic link to it
(in a manner similar to the way that symbolic links work on Unix).

</P>
<P>
On Windows, you make a symbolic link to a database by creating a file
that contains the path to the destination directory and saving this in
the <TT>`mysql_data'</TT> directory under the filename <TT>`database.sym'</TT>.
Note that the symbolic link will be used only if the directory
<TT>`mysql_data_dir\database'</TT> doesn't exist.

</P>
<P>
For example, if the MySQL data directory is <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT>
and you want to have database <CODE>foo</CODE> located at <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>, you
should create the file <TT>`C:\mysql\data\foo.sym'</TT> that contains the
text <CODE>D:\data\foo\</CODE>.  After that, all tables created in the database
<CODE>foo</CODE> will be created in <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note that because of the speed penalty you get when opening every table,
we have not enabled this by default even if you have compiled
MySQL with support for this. To enable symlinks you should put
in your <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> or <CODE>my.ini</CODE> file the following entry:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
use-symbolic-links
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL 4.0 we will enable symlinks by default. Then you
should instead use the <CODE>skip-symlink</CODE> option if you want to
disable this.

</P>
<P>
MySQL-Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. This version
of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding Unix version
with the following exceptions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Win95 and threads</STRONG>
<DD>
Win95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread creation.
Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you shouldn't
run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> for an extended time on Win95 if your server handles
many connections!  WinNT and Win98 don't suffer from this bug.

<DT><STRONG>Concurrent reads</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL depends on the <CODE>pread()</CODE> and <CODE>pwrite()</CODE> calls to be
able to mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  Currently we use mutexes
to emulate <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE>.  We will, in the long run,
replace the file level interface with a virtual interface so that we can
use the <CODE>readfile()</CODE>/<CODE>writefile()</CODE> interface on NT to get more speed.
The current implementation limits the number of open files MySQL
can use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to run as many
concurrent threads on NT as on Unix.

<DT><STRONG>Blocking read</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection.
This means that:


<UL>
<LI>

A connection will not be disconnected automatically after 8 hours, as happens
with the Unix version of MySQL.

<LI>

If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without killing
MySQL.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> will not work on a sleeping connection.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> can't abort as long as there are sleeping
connections.
</UL>

We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have figured out a
nice workaround.

<DT><STRONG>UDF functions</STRONG>
<DD>
For the moment, MySQL-Windows does not support user-definable
functions.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

<DT><STRONG>Killing MySQL from the task manager</STRONG>
<DD>
You can't kill MySQL from the task manager or with the shutdown
utility in Win95.  You must take it down with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Case-insensitive names</STRONG>
<DD>
Filenames are case insensitive on Windows, so database and table names
are also case insensitive in MySQL for Windows.  The only
restriction is that database and table names must be specified using the same
case throughout a given statement.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<DT><STRONG>The <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> directory character</STRONG>
<DD>
Pathname components in Win95 are separated by the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character, which is
also the escape character in MySQL.  If you are using <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> or <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, you must double the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>
character:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:\\tmp\\skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

Alternatively, use Unix style filenames with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> characters:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/tmp/skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Can't open named pipe</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you use a MySQL 3.22 version on NT with the newest mysql-clients
you will get the following error:


<PRE>
error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
This is because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT 
by default.  You can avoid this error by using the <CODE>--host=localhost</CODE> 
option to the new MySQL clients or create an option file
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> that contains the following information:


<PRE>
[client]
host = localhost
</PRE>

Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is started
with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Access denied for user</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you get the error <CODE>Access denied for user: 'some-user@unknown'
to database 'mysql'</CODE> when accessing a MySQL server on the same
machine, this means that MySQL can't resolve your host name
properly.

To fix this, you should create a file <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> with the
following information:


<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
While you are executing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement, the table is locked
from usage by other threads.  This has to do with the fact that on Windows,
you can't delete a file that is in use by another threads.  (In the future,
we may find some way to work around this problem.)

<DT><STRONG><CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is in use by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table will not work</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>MERGE</CODE> handler does its table mapping hidden from MySQL.
Because Windows doesn't allow you to drop files that are open, you first
must flush all <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables (with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>) or drop the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table before dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same 
time we introduce <CODE>VIEW</CODE>s.
</DL>

<P>
Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us with the Windows
release:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make a single-user <CODE>MYSQL.DLL</CODE> server.  This should include everything in
a standard MySQL server, except thread creation.  This will make
MySQL much easier to use in applications that don't need a true
client/server and don't need to access the server from other hosts.

<LI>

Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

<LI>

Create a tool to manage registry entries for the MySQL startup
options.  The registry entry reading is already coded into <TT>`mysqld.cc'</TT>,
but it should be recoded to be more parameter oriented.  The tool should
also be able to update the <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> option file if the user prefers
to use that instead of the registry.

<LI>

When registering <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service with <CODE>--install</CODE> (on NT)
it would be nice if you could also add default options on the command line.
For the moment, the workaround is to list the parameters in the
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file instead.

<LI>

It would be real nice to be able to kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from the task manager.
For the moment, you must use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<LI>

Port <CODE>readline</CODE> to Windows for use in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line tool.

<LI>

GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (<CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>) would be nice.

<LI>

It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in <TT>`net.c'</TT> were
interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open threads with 
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> on Windows.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> always starts in the "C" locale and not in the default locale.
We would like to have <CODE>mysqld</CODE> use the current locale for the sort order.

<LI>

Implement UDF functions with <CODE>.DLL</CODE>s.

<LI>

Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement methods
provided by Windows.

</UL>

<P>
Other Windows-specific issues are described in the <TT>`README'</TT> file that
comes with the MySQL-Windows distribution.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX337"></A>
<A NAME="IDX338"></A>

</P>
<P>
On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris <CODE>tar</CODE> can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

</P>

<PRE>
x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
tar: directory checksum error
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, you must use GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> (<CODE>gtar</CODE>) to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/</a>.

</P>
<P>
Sun native threads work only on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version 2.4 and
earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error from configure:

</P>

<PRE>
checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not run test
programs while cross compiling
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you have something wrong with your compiler installation!
In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer version.  You may
also be able to solve this problem by inserting the following row into the
<TT>`config.cache'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=${ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'}
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is
<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.  You can find this at <a HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>.
Note that <CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.1 and <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 don't work reliably on
SPARC!

</P>
<P>
The recommended <CODE>configure</CODE> line when using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
If you have a ultra sparc, you can get 4 % more performance by adding
"-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

</P>
<P>
If you have Sun Workshop (Fortre) 5.3 (or newer) compiler, you can
run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -xO4 -native -xstrconst -mt" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -xO4 -mt" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 6 % speedup on an Ultrasparc when
using Sun Workshop 5.3 compared to using gcc with -mcpu flags.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> or <CODE>sched_yield</CODE>,
you can fix this by adding <CODE>LIBS=-lrt</CODE> to the configure line

</P>
<P>
The following paragraph is only relevant for older compilers than
WorkShop 5.3:

</P>
<P>
You may also have to edit the <CODE>configure</CODE> script to change this line:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1
</PRE>

<P>
to this:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__)
</PRE>

<P>
If you turn on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> with the <CODE>-Xc</CODE> option, the Sun compiler
can't compile with the Solaris <TT>`pthread.h'</TT> header file.  This is a Sun
bug (broken compiler or broken include file).

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> issues the error message shown below when you run it, you have
tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (<CODE>-mt</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-mt</CODE> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> and try again.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
it means that your <CODE>gcc</CODE> is not configured for your version of Solaris:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'
</PRE>

<P>
The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
<CODE>gcc</CODE> and compile it with your current <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler!  At
least for Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of <CODE>gcc</CODE> have
old, unusable include files that will break all programs that use
threads (and possibly other programs)!

</P>
<P>
Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(<CODE>libpthreads</CODE> and <CODE>libdl</CODE>), so you can't compile MySQL
with <CODE>--static</CODE>.  If you try to do so, you will get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found

or

undefined reference to `dlopen'

or

cannot find -lrt
</PRE>

<P>
If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

</P>

<PRE>
Error in accept: Protocol error
</PRE>

<P>
You might try starting the server with the <CODE>--set-variable back_log=50</CODE>
option as a workaround for this. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  mysqld Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are linking your own MySQL client, you might get the
following error when you try to execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#: open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
The problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`libmysqclient.so'</TT> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX339"></A>
<A NAME="IDX340"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
When using the <CODE>--with-libwrap</CODE> configure option, you must also
include the libraries that <TT>`libwrap.a'</TT> needs:

</P>

<PRE>
--with-libwrap="/opt/NUtcpwrapper-7.6/lib/libwrap.a -lnsl -lsocket
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems with configure trying to link with <CODE>-lz</CODE> and
you don't have <CODE>zlib</CODE> installed, you have two options:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to be able to use the compressed communication protocol,
you need to get and install zlib from ftp.gnu.org.

<LI>

Configure with <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using gcc and have problems with loading <CODE>UDF</CODE> functions
into MySQL, try adding <CODE>-lgcc</CODE> to the link line for the
<CODE>UDF</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
<TT>`support-files/mysql.server'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and create a
symbolic link to it named <TT>`/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server'</TT>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_2.7" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_2.7">2.6.3.1  Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to autodetect
new versions of Solaris and enable workarounds for the following problems!

</P>
<P>
Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use <CODE>gcc</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
/usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition
</PRE>

<P>
If this occurs, you can do the following to fix the problem:

</P>
<P>
Copy <CODE>/usr/include/widec.h</CODE> to
<CODE>.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include</CODE> and change line 41 from:

</P>

<PRE>
#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint)

to

#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint) &#38;& !defined(getwc)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you can edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove <TT>`config.cache'</TT> and run
<CODE>configure</CODE> again!

</P>
<P>
If you get errors like this when you run <CODE>make</CODE>, it's because
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect the <TT>`curses.h'</TT> file (probably
because of the error in <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
In file included from mysql.cc:50:
/usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
/usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'
</PRE>

<P>
The solution to this is to do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Configure with <CODE>CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H ./configure</CODE>.

<LI>

Edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> as indicted above and rerun configure.

<LI>

Remove the <CODE>#define HAVE_TERM</CODE> line from <TT>`config.h'</TT> file and
run <CODE>make</CODE> again.
</UL>

<P>
If you get a problem that your linker can't find <CODE>-lz</CODE> when linking
your client program, the problem is probably that your <TT>`libz.so'</TT> file is
installed in <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>.  You can fix this by one of the
following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Add <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> to <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>.

<LI>

Add a link to <TT>`libz.so'</TT> from <TT>`/lib'</TT>.

<LI>

If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional zlib from your
Solaris 8 CD distribution.

<LI>

Configure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_x86" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_x86">2.6.3.2  Solaris x86 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
On Solaris 2.8 on x86, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will core dump if you run
'strip' in.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> on Solaris x86 and you
experience problems with core dumps under load, you should use the
following <CODE>configure</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions.

</P>
<P>
If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run
it with a trace file or under <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">G.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

<H4><A NAME="FreeBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#FreeBSD">2.6.4.1  FreeBSD Notes</A></H4>

<P>
FreeBSD 3.x is recommended for running MySQL since the thread package
is much more integrated.

</P>
<P>
The easiest and therefor the preferred way to install is to use the 
mysql-server and mysql-client ports available on <a HREF="http://www.freebsd.org">http://www.freebsd.org</a>.

</P>
<P>
Using these gives you:

<UL>
<LI>

A working MySQL with all optimizations known to work on your version
of FreeBSD enabled.

<LI>

Automatic configuration and build.

<LI>

Startup scripts installed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d.

<LI>

Ability to see which files that are installed with pkg_info -L. And to
remove them all with pkg_delete if you no longer want MySQL on that
machine.
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x and native threads on
Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with  native threads on some late
2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems shutting down <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s require GNU make (<CODE>gmake</CODE>) to work.  If
you want to compile MySQL you need to install GNU <CODE>make</CODE> first.

</P>
<P>
Be sure to have your name resolver setup correct.  Otherwise you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Make sure that the <CODE>localhost</CODE> entry in the <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file is
correct (otherwise you will have problems connecting to the database).  The
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file should start with a line:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain
</PRE>

<P>
If you notice that <CODE>configure</CODE> will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get an error from <CODE>make install</CODE> that it can't find
<TT>`/usr/include/pthreads'</TT>, <CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads.  This is fixed by executing these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; ./configure --with-mit-threads
</PRE>

<P>
FreeBSD is also known to have a very low default file handle limit.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Not_enough_file_handles">A.2.16  File Not Found</A>.  Uncomment the ulimit -n section in
safe_mysqld or raise the limits for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> user in /etc/login.conf
(and rebuild it with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf).  Also be sure you set the
appropriate class for this user in the password file if you are not
using the default (use: chpass mysqld-user-name).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
<CODE>TZ</CODE> variable will probably help.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a secure and stable system you should only use FreeBSD kernels

<P>
You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
<CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!  This will run
all threads with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

</P>
<P>
If you get the error <CODE>virtual memory exhausted</CODE> while compiling,
you should try using <CODE>ulimit -v 80000</CODE> and run <CODE>make</CODE> again.

On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared libraries.
The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs, for example,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to use
shared libraries with the <CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to configure.

</P>
<P>
Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
binary after a while can't open tables.  This is because some
library/system related bug causes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to change current
directory without asking for this!

</P>
<P>
The fix is to either upgrade to 3.23.34 or after running <CODE>configure</CODE>
remove the line <CODE>#define HAVE_REALPATH</CODE> from <CODE>config.h</CODE>
before running make.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that you can't symbolic link a database directories
to another database directory or symbolic link a table to another database
on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is ok).

<P>
Some of the binary distributions of MySQL for HP-UX is
distributed as an HP depot file and as a tar file.  To use the depot
file you must be running at least HP-UX 10.x to have access to HP's
software depot tools.

</P>
<P>
The HP version of MySQL was compiled on an HP 9000/8xx server
under HP-UX 10.20, and uses MIT-pthreads.  It is known to work well under 
this configuration.  MySQL Version 3.22.26 and newer can also be 
built with HP's native thread package.

</P>
<P>
Other configurations that may work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20+
<LI>

HP 9000/8xx running HP-UX 10.30
</UL>

<P>
The following configurations almost definitely won't work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 10.x where x &#60; 2
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 9.x
</UL>

<P>
To install the distribution, use one of the commands below, where
<CODE>/path/to/depot</CODE> is the full pathname of the depot file:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To install everything, including the server, client and development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.full
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.server
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the client package:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.client
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.developer
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The depot places binaries and libraries in <TT>`/opt/mysql'</TT> and data in
<TT>`/var/opt/mysql'</TT>. The depot also creates the appropriate entries in
<TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and <TT>`/etc/rc2.d'</TT> to start the server automatically
at boot time.  Obviously, this entails being <CODE>root</CODE> to install.

</P>
<P>
To install the HP-UX tar.gz distribution, you must have a copy of GNU
<CODE>tar</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="HP-UX_10.20" HREF="manual_toc.html#HP-UX_10.20">2.6.6.2  HP-UX Version 10.20 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on
HP-UX.  We recommend that you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> instead of the HP-UX native
compiler, because <CODE>gcc</CODE> produces better code!

</P>
<P>
We recommend using gcc 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimization
flags (like -O6) as this may not be safe on HP-UX.

</P>
<P>
Note that MIT-pthreads can't be compiled with the HP-UX compiler
because it can't compile <CODE>.S</CODE> (assembler) files.

</P>
<P>
The following configure line should work:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include" CXXFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" CXX=gcc ./configure --with-pthread --with-named-thread-libs='-ldce' --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
</PRE>

<P>
If you are compiling <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95 yourself, you should NOT link it with
the DCE libraries (<CODE>libdce.a</CODE> or <CODE>libcma.a</CODE>) if you want to compile
MySQL with MIT-pthreads.  If you mix the DCE and MIT-pthreads
packages you will get a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to which you cannot connect.  Remove
the DCE libraries while you compile <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95!

</P>



<H4><A NAME="HP-UX_11.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#HP-UX_11.x">2.6.6.3  HP-UX Version 11.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
For HP-UX Version 11.x we recommend MySQL Version 3.23.15 or later.

</P>
<P>
Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you should
install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on HP-UX 11.0:

</P>

<PRE>
PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative
</PRE>

<P>
This will solve a problem that one gets <CODE>EWOULDBLOCK</CODE> from <CODE>recv()</CODE> 
and <CODE>EBADF</CODE> from <CODE>accept()</CODE> in threaded applications.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system,
you will get the error:

</P>

<P>
The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define <CODE>pthreads_atfork()</CODE> consistently.
It has conflicting prototypes in
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT>:184 and
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/pthread.h'</TT>:440 (details below).

</P>
<P>
One solution is to copy <TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT> into
<TT>`mysql/include'</TT> and edit <TT>`unistd.h'</TT> and change it to match
the definition in <TT>`pthread.h'</TT>.  Here's the diff:

I had to use the compile-time flag <CODE>-D_REENTRANT</CODE> to get the compiler 
to recognize the prototype for <CODE>localtime_r</CODE>. Alternatively I could have
supplied the prototype for <CODE>localtime_r</CODE>. But I wanted to catch other 
bugs without needing to run into them.  I wasn't sure where I needed it, so I
added it to all flags.
<LI>

The optimization flags used by MySQL (-O3) are not recognized by HP's
compilers.  I did not change the flags.

<A NAME="IDX343"></A>

</P>
<P>
Automatic detection of <CODE>xlC</CODE> is missing from Autoconf, so a
<CODE>configure</CODE> command something like this is needed when compiling
MySQL (This example uses the IBM compiler):

</P>

<PRE>
export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
export LDLFAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
		--localstatedir=/var/mysql \
		--sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
		--sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
		--libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
		--enable-thread-safe-client \
		--enable-large-files
</PRE>

<P>
Above are the options used to compile the MySQL distribution that
can be found at <a HREF="http://www-frec.bull.com/">http://www-frec.bull.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the <CODE>-O3</CODE> to <CODE>-O2</CODE> in the above configure line,
you must also remove the <CODE>-qstrict</CODE> option (this is a limitation in
the IBM C compiler).

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> to compile MySQL, you
<STRONG>MUST</STRONG> use the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> flag, as the exception
handling in <CODE>gcc</CODE>/<CODE>egcs</CODE> is not thread safe!  (This is tested with
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.).  There are also some known problems with IBM's assembler,
which may cause it to generate bad code when used with gcc.

</P>
<P>
We recommend the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line with <CODE>egcs</CODE> and
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE> on AIX:

</P>

<PRE>
CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>-Wa,-many</CODE> is necessary for the compile to be successful.  IBM is
aware of this problem but is in to hurry to fix it because of the workaround
available.  We don't know if the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> is required with 
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE>, but as MySQL doesn't use exceptions and the above 
option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always use this 
option with <CODE>egcs / gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with assembler code try changing the -mcpu=xxx to
match your cpu. Typically power2, power, or powerpc may need to be used,
alternatively you might need to use 604 or 604e. I'm not positive but I
would think using "power" would likely be safe most of the time, even on
a power2 machine.

</P>
<P>
If you don't know what your cpu is then do a "uname -m", this will give
you back a string that looks like "000514676700", with a format of
xxyyyyyymmss where xx and ss are always 0's, yyyyyy is a unique system
id and mm is the id of the CPU Planar. A chart of these values can be
found at
<a HREF="http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm">http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm</a>.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of cpu you have.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals.  In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
       CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

</P>
<P>
On some versions of AIX, linking with <CODE>libbind.a</CODE> makes
<CODE>getservbyname</CODE> core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported
to IBM.

</P>
<P>
For AIX 4.2.1 and gcc you have to do the following changes.

</P>
<P>
After configuring, edit <TT>`config.h'</TT> and <TT>`include/my_config.h'</TT>
and change the line that says

</P>

<PRE>
#define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1
</PRE>

<P>
to

</P>

<PRE>
#undef HAVE_SNPRINTF
</PRE>

<P>
And finally, in <TT>`mysqld.cc'</TT> you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

</P>

<PRE>
#ifdef _AIX41
extern "C" int initgroups(const char *,int);
#endif

<H4><A NAME="SunOS" HREF="manual_toc.html#SunOS">2.6.6.5  SunOS 4 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL, which in turn
means you will need GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and <CODE>libtool</CODE>.
You can use the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line to avoid this problem:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --disable-shared --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

<P>
When compiling <CODE>readline</CODE>, you may get warnings about duplicate defines.

If you are using egcs 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to gcc
2.95.2, as egcs on DEC has some serious bugs!

</P>
<P>
When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the <CODE>-pthread</CODE> option for <CODE>cc</CODE> and <CODE>cxx</CODE> and
the libraries <CODE>-lmach -lexc</CODE> (in addition to <CODE>-lpthread</CODE>).  You
should run <CODE>configure</CODE> something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CC="cc -pthread" CXX="cxx -pthread -O" \
./configure --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"

<P>
When compiling <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you may see a couple of warnings like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld.cc: In function void handle_connections()':
mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'
</PRE>

<P>
You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because <CODE>configure</CODE>
can detect only errors, not warnings.

</P>
<P>
If you start the server directly from the command line, you may have problems
with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your outstanding processes
receive a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal.)  If so, try starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; nohup mysqld [options] &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>nohup</CODE> causes the command following it to ignore any <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
signal sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, which invokes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> using <CODE>nohup</CODE> for you.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem when compiling mysys/get_opt.c, just remove the
line #define _NO_PROTO from the start of that file!

</P>

On OSF1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev. 878)"
the compiler had some strange behavior (undefined <CODE>asm</CODE> symbols).
<CODE>/bin/ld</CODE> also appears to be broken (problems with <CODE>_exit

sql_acl.cc:1456: Internal compiler error in `scan_region', at except.c:2566
Please submit a full bug report.
</PRE>

<P>
To fix this you should change to the <CODE>sql</CODE> directory and do a ``cut
and paste'' of the last <CODE>gcc</CODE> line, but change <CODE>-O3</CODE> to
<CODE>-O0</CODE> (or add <CODE>-O0</CODE> immediately after <CODE>gcc</CODE> if you don't
have any <CODE>-O</CODE> option on your compile line.)  After this is done you
can just change back to the top-level directly and run <CODE>make</CODE>
again.

For OpenServer 5.0.X you need to use GDS in Skunkware 95 (95q4c).  This
is necessary because GNU <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.2 in Skunkware 97 does not have
GNU <CODE>as</CODE>.  You can also use <CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.2 or newer
<a HREF="http://www.egcs.com/">http://www.egcs.com/</a>.  If you are using <CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.2 you have

<LI>

You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
system.  They are required on this version of SCO Unix.  You cannot
just use the GCC Dev system.

<LI>

You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.  This can be
found at
<a HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/FSU-threads.tar.gz">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/FSU-threads.tar.gz</a>.
You can also get a precompiled package from
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz</a>.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads can be compiled with SCO Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the SCO
Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or OS
3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of problems
without a good port.  The port for this product requires the SCO Unix
Development system.  Without it, you are missing the libraries and the
linker that is needed.

<LI>

To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Run <CODE>./configure</CODE> in the <TT>`threads/src'</TT> directory and select
the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies <TT>`Makefile.SCO5'</TT> to
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>.

Run <CODE>make</CODE>.

<LI>

To install in the default <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> directory, login as root,
then <CODE>cd</CODE> to the <TT>`thread/src'</TT> directory, and run <CODE>make
install</CODE>.
</OL>

<LI>

Remember to use GNU <CODE>make</CODE> when making MySQL.

<LI>

If you don't start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as root, you probably will get only the
default 110 open files per process.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a note about this
in the log file.

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
You should also use gcc 2.95.2 or newer!

The following <CODE>configure</CODE> command should work:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
</PRE>

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.

SCO development notes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
with <CODE>-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads</CODE>.

<LI>

The SCO development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.  SCO claims
that its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must be reentrant with
FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries to use the SCO scheme to
make re-entrant libraries.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads (at least the version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>) comes 
linked with GNU <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  If you encounter problems with memory usage, 
make sure that <TT>`gmalloc.o'</TT> is included in <TT>`libgthreads.a'</TT> and 
<TT>`libgthreads.so'</TT>.

<LI>

In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware: <CODE>read()</CODE>,
<CODE>write()</CODE>, <CODE>getmsg()</CODE>, <CODE>connect()</CODE>, <CODE>accept()</CODE>,
<CODE>select()</CODE>, and <CODE>wait()</CODE>.

<LI>

The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (ver 2.0.0) breaks FSU threads and
makes mysqld instable.  You have to remove this one if you want to run
mysqld on an OpenServer 5.0.6 machine.

This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing
how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client program to create and use a simple
database.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> (sometimes referred to as the ``terminal monitor'' or
just ``monitor'') is an interactive program that allows you to connect to a
MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> may
also be used in batch mode: you place your queries in a file beforehand, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute the contents of the file.  Both ways of using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> are covered here.

</P>
<P>
To see a list of options provided by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, invoke it with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --help
</PRE>

<P>
This chapter assumes that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is installed on your machine and that
a MySQL server is available to which you can connect.  If this is
not true, contact your MySQL administrator.  (If <EM>you</EM> are the
administrator, you will need to consult other sections of this manual.)

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database.  If you are interested only in accessing an already-existing
database, you may want to skip over the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are necessarily left
out.  Consult the relevant sections of the manual for more

To connect to the server, you'll usually need to provide a MySQL
user name when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE> and, most likely, a password.  If the
server runs on a machine other than the one where you log in, you'll also
need to specify a hostname.  Contact your administrator to find out what
connection parameters you should use to connect (that is, what host, user name,
and password to use).  Once you know the proper parameters, you should be
able to connect like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>********</CODE> represents your password; enter it when <CODE>mysql</CODE>
displays the <CODE>Enter password:</CODE> prompt.

</P>
<P>
If that works, you should see some introductory information followed by a
<CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 459 to server version: 3.22.20a-log

Type 'help' for help.

mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready for you to enter commands.

</P>
<P>
Some MySQL installations allow users to connect as the anonymous
(unnamed) user to the server running on the local host.  If this is the case
on your machine, you should be able to connect to that server by invoking
<CODE>mysql</CODE> without any options:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
After you have connected successfully, you can disconnect any time by typing
<CODE>QUIT</CODE> at the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; QUIT
Bye
</PRE>

<P>
You can also disconnect by pressing Control-D.

</P>
<P>
Most examples in the following sections assume you are connected to the
server.  They indicate this by the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt.

<P>
Make sure you are connected to the server, as discussed in the previous
section.  Doing so will not in itself select any database to work with, but
that's okay.  At this point, it's more important to find out a little about
how to issue queries than to jump right in creating tables, loading data
into them, and retrieving data from them.  This section describes the basic
principles of entering commands, using several queries you can try out to
familiarize yourself with how <CODE>mysql</CODE> works.

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple command that asks the server to tell you its version number
and the current date.  Type it in as shown below following the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
prompt and hit the RETURN key:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------+--------------+
| version()    | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log | 1999-03-19   |
+--------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
This query illustrates several things about <CODE>mysql</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A command normally consists of a SQL statement followed by a semicolon.
(There are some exceptions where a semicolon is not needed.  <CODE>QUIT</CODE>,
mentioned earlier, is one of them.  We'll get to others later.)

<LI>

When you issue a command, <CODE>mysql</CODE> sends it to the server for execution
and displays the results, then prints another <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> to indicate
that it is ready for another command.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> displays query output as a table (rows and columns).  The first
row contains labels for the columns.  The rows following are the query
results.  Normally, column labels are the names of the columns you fetch from
database tables.  If you're retrieving the value of an expression rather than
a table column (as in the example just shown), <CODE>mysql</CODE> labels the column
using the expression itself.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> shows how many rows were returned and how long the query took
to execute, which gives you a rough idea of server performance.  These values
are imprecise because they represent wall clock time (not CPU or machine
time), and because they are affected by factors such as server load and
network latency.  (For brevity, the ``rows in set'' line is not shown in
the remaining examples in this chapter.)
</UL>

<P>
Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.  The following queries are
equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
mysql&#62; select version(), current_date;
mysql&#62; SeLeCt vErSiOn(), current_DATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Here's another query.  It demonstrates that you can use <CODE>mysql</CODE> as a
simple calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SIN(PI()/4), (4+1)*5;
+-------------+---------+
| SIN(PI()/4) | (4+1)*5 |
+-------------+---------+
|    0.707107 |      25 |
+-------------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
The commands shown thus far have been relatively short, single-line
statements.  You can even enter multiple statements on a single line.
Just end each one with a semicolon:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();
+--------------+
| version()    |
+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log |
+--------------+

+---------------------+
| NOW()               |
+---------------------+
| 1999-03-19 00:15:33 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
A command need not be given all on a single line, so lengthy commands that
require several lines are not a problem.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> determines where your
statement ends by looking for the terminating semicolon, not by looking for
the end of the input line.  (In other words, <CODE>mysql</CODE>
accepts free-format input:  it collects input lines but does not execute them
until it sees the semicolon.)

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple multiple-line statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; ,
    -&#62; CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------------+--------------+
| USER()             | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------------+--------------+
| joesmith@localhost | 1999-03-18   |
+--------------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, notice how the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> to
<CODE>-&#62;</CODE> after you enter the first line of a multiple-line query.  This is
how <CODE>mysql</CODE> indicates that it hasn't seen a complete statement and is
waiting for the rest.  The prompt is your friend, because it provides
valuable feedback.  If you use that feedback, you will always be aware of
what <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for.

</P>
<P>
If you decide you don't want to execute a command that you are in the
process of entering, cancel it by typing <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; \c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Here, too, notice the prompt.  It switches back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> after you
type <CODE>\c</CODE>, providing feedback to indicate that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready
for a new command.

</P>
<P>
The following table shows each of the prompts you may see and summarizes what
they mean about the state that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is in:

</P>
<P>
Multiple-line statements commonly occur by accident when you intend to
issue a command on a single line, but forget the terminating semicolon.  In
this case, <CODE>mysql</CODE> waits for more input:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If this happens to you (you think you've entered a statement but the only
response is a <CODE>-&#62;</CODE> prompt), most likely <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for the
semicolon.  If you don't notice what the prompt is telling you, you might sit
there for a while before realizing what you need to do.  Enter a semicolon to
complete the statement, and <CODE>mysql</CODE> will execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62; ;
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| joesmith@localhost |
+--------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts occur during string collection.
In MySQL, you can write strings surrounded by either <SAMP>`''</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> characters (for example, <CODE>'hello'</CODE> or <CODE>"goodbye"</CODE>),
and <CODE>mysql</CODE> lets you enter strings that span multiple lines.  When you
see a <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt, it means that you've entered a line
containing a string that begins with a <SAMP>`''</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> quote character,
but have not yet entered the matching quote that terminates the string.
That's fine if you really are entering a multiple-line string, but how likely
is that?  Not very.  More often, the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts indicate
that you've inadvertantly left out a quote character.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If you enter this <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, then hit RETURN and wait for the
result, nothing will happen.  Instead of wondering why this
query takes so long, notice the clue provided by the <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt.  It
tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> expects to see the rest of an unterminated
string.  (Do you see the error in the statement?  The string <CODE>"Smith</CODE> is
missing the second quote.)

</P>
<P>
At this point, what do you do?  The simplest thing is to cancel the command.
However, you cannot just type <CODE>\c</CODE> in this case, because <CODE>mysql</CODE>
interprets it as part of the string that it is collecting!  Instead, enter
the closing quote character (so <CODE>mysql</CODE> knows you've finished the
string), then type <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62; "\c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt changes back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>, indicating that <CODE>mysql</CODE>
is ready for a new command.

</P>
<P>
It's important to know what the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts signify,
because if you mistakenly enter an unterminated string, any further lines you
type will appear to be ignored by <CODE>mysql</CODE> -- including a line
containing <CODE>QUIT</CODE>!  This can be quite confusing, especially if you
don't know that you need to supply the terminating quote before you can
cancel the current command.

<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
<A NAME="IDX358"></A>

</P>

<P>
Now that you know how to enter commands, it's time to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have several pets in your home (your menagerie) and you'd
like to keep track of various types of information about them.  You can do so
by creating tables to hold your data and loading them with the desired
information.  Then you can answer different sorts of questions about your
animals by retrieving data from the tables.  This section shows you how to:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Create a database
<LI>

Create a table
<LI>

Load data into the table
<LI>

Retrieve data from the table in various ways
<LI>

Use multiple tables
</UL>

<P>
The menagerie database will be simple (deliberately), but it is not difficult
to think of real-world situations in which a similar type of database might
be used.  For example, a database like this could be used by a farmer to keep
track of livestock, or by a veterinarian to keep track of patient records.
A menagerie distribution containing some of the queries and sample data used
in the following sections can be obtained from the MySQL Web site.
It's available in either
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz">compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> format</a>
or
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip">Zip format</a>.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>SHOW</CODE> statement to find out what databases currently exist
on the server:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW DATABASES;
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| mysql    |
| test     |
| tmp      |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
The list of databases is probably different on your machine, but the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> and <CODE>test</CODE> databases are likely to be among them.  The
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database is required because it describes user access
privileges.  The <CODE>test</CODE> database is often provided as a workspace for
users to try things out.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>test</CODE> database exists, try to access it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE test
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>USE</CODE>, like <CODE>QUIT</CODE>, does not require a semicolon.  (You
can terminate such statements with a semicolon if you like; it does no harm.)
The <CODE>USE</CODE> statement is special in another way, too:  it must be given on
a single line.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>test</CODE> database (if you have access to it) for the
examples that follow, but anything you create in that database can be
removed by anyone else with access to it.  For this reason, you should
probably ask your MySQL administrator for permission to use a
database of your own.  Suppose you want to call yours <CODE>menagerie</CODE>.  The
administrator needs to execute a command like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO your_mysql_name;
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>your_mysql_name</CODE> is the MySQL user name assigned to
you.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_database" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_database">3.3.1  Creating and Selecting a Database</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>

</P>
<P>
If the administrator creates your database for you when setting up your
permissions, you can begin using it.  Otherwise, you need to create it
yourself:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
</PRE>

<P>
Under Unix, database names are case sensitive (unlike SQL keywords), so you
must always refer to your database as <CODE>menagerie</CODE>, not as
<CODE>Menagerie</CODE>, <CODE>MENAGERIE</CODE>, or some other variant.  This is also true
for table names.  (Under Windows, this restriction does not apply, although
you must refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase throughout a
given query.)

</P>
<P>
Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly.
To make <CODE>menagerie</CODE> the current database, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE menagerie
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for use
each time you begin a <CODE>mysql</CODE> session.  You can do this by issuing a
<CODE>USE</CODE> statement as shown above.  Alternatively, you can select the
database on the command line when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE>.  Just specify its
name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>menagerie</CODE> is not your password on the command just shown.
If you want to supply your password on the command line after the <CODE>-p</CODE>
option, you must do so with no intervening space (for example, as
<CODE>-pmypassword</CODE>, not as <CODE>-p mypassword</CODE>).  However, putting your
password on the command line is not recommended, because doing so exposes it
to snooping by other users logged in on your machine.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_tables">3.3.2  Creating a Table</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>

</P>
<P>
Creating the database is the easy part, but at this point it's empty, as
<CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> will tell you:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The harder part is deciding what the structure of your database should be:
what tables you will need and what columns will be in each of them.

</P>
<P>
You'll want a table that contains a record for each of your pets.  This can
be called the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, and it should contain, as a bare minimum,
each animal's name.  Because the name by itself is not very interesting, the
table should contain other information.  For example, if more than one person
in your family keeps pets, you might want to list each animal's owner.  You
might also want to record some basic descriptive information such as species
and sex.

</P>
<P>
How about age?  That might be of interest, but it's not a good thing to store
in a database.  Age changes as time passes, which means you'd have to update
your records often.  Instead, it's better to store a fixed value such as
date of birth.  Then, whenever you need age, you can calculate it as the
difference between the current date and the birth date.  MySQL
provides functions for doing date arithmetic, so this is not difficult.
Storing birth date rather than age has other advantages, too:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can use the database for tasks such as generating reminders for upcoming
pet birthdays.  (If you think this type of query is somewhat silly, note that
it is the same question you might ask in the context of a business database
to identify clients to whom you'll soon need to send out birthday greetings,
for that computer-assisted personal touch.)

<LI>

You can calculate age in relation to dates other than the current date.  For
example, if you store death date in the database, you can easily calculate
how old a pet was when it died.
</UL>

<P>
You can probably think of other types of information that would be useful in
the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, but the ones identified so far are sufficient for now:
name, owner, species, sex, birth, and death.

</P>
<P>
Use a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to specify the layout of your table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
    -&#62; species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is a good choice for the <CODE>name</CODE>, <CODE>owner</CODE>, and
<CODE>species</CODE> columns because the column values will vary in length.  The
lengths of those columns need not all be the same, and need not be
<CODE>20</CODE>.  You can pick any length from <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>, whatever
seems most reasonable to you.  (If you make a poor choice and it turns
out later that you need a longer field, MySQL provides an
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Animal sex can be represented in a variety of ways, for example, <CODE>"m"</CODE>
and <CODE>"f"</CODE>, or perhaps <CODE>"male"</CODE> and <CODE>"female"</CODE>.  It's simplest
to use the single characters <CODE>"m"</CODE> and <CODE>"f"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The use of the <CODE>DATE</CODE> data type for the <CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>death</CODE>
columns is a fairly obvious choice.

</P>
<P>
Now that you have created a table, <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> should produce some
output:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
To verify that your table was created the way you expected, use
a <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> any time, for example, if you forget the names of
the columns in your table or what types they are.

</P>

After creating your table, you need to populate it.  The <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements are useful for this.

</P>

Suppose your pet records can be described as shown below.

</TABLE>

<P>
Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate it is to
create a text file containing a row for each of your animals, then load the
contents of the file into the table with a single statement.

</P>
<P>
You could create a text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> containing one record per line,
with values separated by tabs, and given in the order in which the columns
were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  For missing values (such
as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still living), you can
use <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.  To represent these in your text file, use
<CODE>\N</CODE>.  For example, the record for Whistler the bird would look like
this (where the whitespace between values is a single tab character):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>Whistler</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>Gwen</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>bird</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>\N</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1997-12-09</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>\N</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To load the text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> into the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, use this
command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

<P>
You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker explicitly
in the <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement if you wish, but the defaults are tab and
linefeed.  These are sufficient for the statement to read the file
<TT>`pet.txt'</TT> properly.

</P>
<P>
When you want to add new records one at a time, the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
is useful.  In its simplest form, you supply values for each column, in the
order in which the columns were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.
Suppose Diane gets a new hamster named Puffball.  You could add a new record
using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO pet
    -&#62; VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that string and date values are specified as quoted strings here.  Also,
with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, you can insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> directly to represent a
missing value.  You do not use <CODE>\N</CODE> like you do with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
From this example, you should be able to see that there would be a lot more
typing involved to load
your records initially using several <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements rather
than a single <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

The general form of the statement is:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT what_to_select
FROM which_table
WHERE conditions_to_satisfy
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>what_to_select</CODE> indicates what you want to see.  This can be a list of

indicates the table from which you want to retrieve data.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause is optional.  If it's present, <CODE>conditions_to_satisfy</CODE> specifies
conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for retrieval.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_all" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_all">3.3.4.1  Selecting All Data</A></H4>

<P>
The simplest form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves everything from a table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet;
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |

| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1998-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
| Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
| Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
| Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
This form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is useful if you want to review your entire table,
for instance, after you've just loaded it with your initial dataset.  As it
happens, the output just shown reveals an error in your data file:  Bowser
appears to have been born after he died!  Consulting your original pedigree
papers, you find that the correct birth year is 1989, not 1998.

</P>
<P>
There are are least a couple of ways to fix this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Edit the file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> to correct the error, then empty the table
and reload it using <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;  # Used for quick re-create of the table
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM pet;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record for Puffball.

<LI>

Fix only the erroneous record with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE pet SET birth = "1989-08-31" WHERE name = "Bowser";
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
As shown above, it is easy to retrieve an entire table.  But typically you
don't want to do that, particularly when the table becomes large.  Instead,
you're usually more interested in answering a particular question, in which
case you specify some constraints on the information you want.  Let's look at
some selection queries in terms of questions about your pets that they
answer.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_rows" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_rows">3.3.4.2  Selecting Particular Rows</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<A NAME="IDX371"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can select only particular rows from your table.  For example, if you want
to verify the change that you made to Bowser's birth date, select Bowser's
record like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = "Bowser";
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Bowser | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The output confirms that the year is correctly recorded now as 1989, not 1998.

</P>
<P>
String comparisons are normally case insensitive, so you can specify the
name as <CODE>"bowser"</CODE>, <CODE>"BOWSER"</CODE>, etc.  The query result will be
the same.

</P>
<P>
You can specify conditions on any column, not just <CODE>name</CODE>.  For example,
if you want to know which animals were born after 1998, test the <CODE>birth</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth &#62;= "1998-1-1";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Puffball | Diane | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can combine conditions, for example, to locate female dogs:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "dog" AND sex = "f";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The preceding query uses the <CODE>AND</CODE> logical operator.  There is also an
<CODE>OR</CODE> operator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "snake" OR species = "bird";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+

If you don't want to see entire rows from your table, just name the columns
in which you're interested, separated by commas.  For example, if you want to
know when your animals were born, select the <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
columns:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet;

To find out who owns pets, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner FROM pet;
+--------+

+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX374"></A>
However, notice that the query simply retrieves the <CODE>owner</CODE> field from
each record, and some of them appear more than once.  To minimize the output,
retrieve each unique output record just once by adding the keyword
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
+--------+

+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to combine row selection with column
selection.  For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only,
use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat";
+--------+---------+------------+

You may have noticed in the preceding examples that the result rows are
displayed in no particular order.  However, it's often easier to examine
query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way.  To sort a
result, use an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

Here are animal birthdays, sorted by date:

<P>
To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the

<P>
You can sort on multiple columns.  For example, to sort by type of
animal, then by birth date within animal type with youngest animals first,
use the following query:

MySQL provides several functions that you can use to perform
calculations on dates, for example, to calculate ages or extract
parts of dates.

</P>
<P>
To determine how many years old each of your pets is, compute the
difference in the year part of the current date and the birth date, then
subtract one if the current date occurs earlier in the calendar year than
the birth date.  The following query shows, for each pet, the birth date,
the current date, and the age in years.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
    -&#62; (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))

<P>
Here, <CODE>YEAR()</CODE> pulls out the year part of a date and <CODE>RIGHT()</CODE>
pulls off the rightmost five characters that represent the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE>
(calendar year) part of the date.  The part of the expression that
compares the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE> values evaluates to 1 or 0, which adjusts the
year difference down a year if <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE> occurs earlier in
the year than <CODE>birth</CODE>.  The full expression is somewhat ungainly,
so an alias (<CODE>age</CODE>) is used to make the output column label more
meaningful.

</P>
<P>
The query works, but the result could be scanned more easily if the rows
were presented in some order.  This can be done by adding an <CODE>ORDER
BY name</CODE> clause to sort the output by name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
    -&#62; (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))

<P>
To sort the output by <CODE>age</CODE> rather than <CODE>name</CODE>, just use a

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,

<P>
A similar query can be used to determine age at death for animals that have
died.  You determine which animals these are by checking whether or not the
<CODE>death</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  Then, for those with non-<CODE>NULL</CODE>
values, compute the difference between the <CODE>death</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
values:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, death,
    -&#62; (YEAR(death)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(death,5)&#60;RIGHT(birth,5))
    -&#62; AS age
    -&#62; FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| name   | birth      | death      | age  |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| Bowser | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |    5 |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The query uses <CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> rather than <CODE>death != NULL</CODE>
because <CODE>NULL</CODE> is a special value.  This is explained later.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Working_with_NULL">3.3.4.6  Working with <CODE>NULL</CODE> Values</A>.

</P>
<P>
What if you want to know which animals have birthdays next month?  For this
type of calculation, year and day are irrelevant; you simply want to extract
the month part of the <CODE>birth</CODE> column.  MySQL provides several
date-part extraction functions, such as <CODE>YEAR()</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, and
<CODE>DAYOFMONTH()</CODE>.  <CODE>MONTH()</CODE> is the appropriate function here.  To
see how it works, run a simple query that displays the value of both
<CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>MONTH(birth)</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
+----------+------------+--------------+
| name     | birth      | MONTH(birth) |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |            2 |

| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |            8 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |            8 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |            9 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |           12 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |            4 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |            3 |
+----------+------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Finding animals with birthdays in the upcoming month is easy, too.  Suppose
the current month is April.  Then the month value is <CODE>4</CODE> and you look
for animals born in May (month 5) like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
+-------+------------+
| name  | birth      |
+-------+------------+
| Buffy | 1989-05-13 |
+-------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There is a small complication if the current month is December, of course.
You don't just add one to the month number (<CODE>12</CODE>) and look for animals
born in month 13, because there is no such month.  Instead, you look for
animals born in January (month 1).

</P>
<P>
You can even write the query so that it works no matter what the current
month is.  That way you don't have to use a particular month number
in the query.  <CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> allows you to add a time interval to a
given date.  If you add a month to the value of <CODE>NOW()</CODE>, then extract
the month part with <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, the result produces the month in which to
look for birthdays:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
</PRE>

<P>
A different way to accomplish the same task is to add <CODE>1</CODE> to get the
next month after the current one (after using the modulo function (<CODE>MOD</CODE>)
to wrap around the month value to <CODE>0</CODE> if it is currently
<CODE>12</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(NOW()), 12) + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>MONTH</CODE> returns a number between 1 and 12. And
<CODE>MOD(something,12)</CODE> returns a number between 0 and 11. So the
addition has to be after the <CODE>MOD()</CODE>, otherwise we would go from
November (11) to January (1).

</P>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE> value can be surprising until you get used to it.
Conceptually, <CODE>NULL</CODE> means missing value or unknown value and it
is treated somewhat differently than other values.  To test for <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
you cannot use the arithmetic comparison operators such as <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
or <CODE>!=</CODE>.  To demonstrate this for yourself, try the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 != NULL, 1 &#60; NULL, 1 &#62; NULL;
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
| 1 = NULL | 1 != NULL | 1 &#60; NULL | 1 &#62; NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
|     NULL |      NULL |     NULL |     NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Clearly you get no meaningful results from these comparisons.  Use
the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and <CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
+-----------+---------------+
| 1 IS NULL | 1 IS NOT NULL |
+-----------+---------------+
|         0 |             1 |
+-----------+---------------+
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL, 0 or <CODE>NULL</CODE> means false and anything else means true.
The default truth value from a boolean operation is 1.

</P>
<P>
This special treatment of <CODE>NULL</CODE> is why, in the previous section, it
was necessary to determine which animals are no longer alive using
<CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>death != NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
SQL pattern matching allows you to use <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> to match any single
character and <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to match an arbitrary number of characters (including
zero characters).  In MySQL, SQL patterns are case insensitive by
default.  Some examples are shown below.  Note that you do not use <CODE>=</CODE>

character:

+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The other type of pattern matching provided by MySQL uses extended
regular expressions.  When you test for a match for this type of pattern, use
the <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> operators (or <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> and
<CODE>NOT RLIKE</CODE>, which are synonyms).

</P>
<P>
Some characteristics of extended regular expressions are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> matches any single character.

<LI>

A character class <SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP> matches any character within the brackets.
For example, <SAMP>`[abc]'</SAMP> matches <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  To name a
range of characters, use a dash.  <SAMP>`[a-z]'</SAMP> matches any lowercase letter,
whereas <SAMP>`[0-9]'</SAMP> matches any digit.

<LI>

<SAMP>`*'</SAMP> matches zero or more instances of the thing preceding it.  For
example, <SAMP>`x*'</SAMP> matches any number of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> characters,
<SAMP>`[0-9]*'</SAMP> matches any number of digits, and <SAMP>`.*'</SAMP> matches any
number of anything.

<LI>

Regular expressions are case sensitive, but you can use a character class to
match both lettercases if you wish.  For example, <SAMP>`[aA]'</SAMP> matches
lowercase or uppercase <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`[a-zA-Z]'</SAMP> matches any letter in
either case.

<LI>

The pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the value being tested.
(SQL patterns match only if they match the entire value.)

<LI>

To anchor a pattern so that it must match the beginning or end of the value
being tested, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> at the beginning or <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> at the end of the
pattern.
</UL>

<P>
To demonstrate how extended regular expressions work, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> queries
shown above are rewritten below to use <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To find names beginning with <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> to match the beginning of
the name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^b";
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Prior to MySQL Version 3.23.4, <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case sensitive, 
and the previous query will return no rows. To match either lowercase or 
uppercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use this query instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^[bB]";
</PRE>

<P>
From MySQL 3.23.4 on, to force a <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> comparison to
be case sensitive, use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword to make one of the
strings a binary string. This query will match only lowercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>
at the beginning of a name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY "^b";
</PRE>

<P>
To find names ending with <SAMP>`fy'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to match the end of the
name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "fy$";
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
To find names containing a lowercase or uppercase <SAMP>`w'</SAMP>, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "w";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Because a regular expression pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the
value, it is not necessary in the previous query to put a wild card on either
side of the pattern to get it to match the entire value like it would be if
you used a SQL pattern.

</P>
<P>
To find names containing exactly five characters, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>
to match the beginning and end of the name, and five instances of <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
in between:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.....$";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You could also write the previous query using the <SAMP>`{n}'</SAMP>
``repeat-<CODE>n</CODE>-times'' operator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.{5}$";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

<P>
Databases are often used to answer the question, ``How often does a certain
type of data occur in a table?''  For example, you might want to know how
many pets you have, or how many pets each owner has, or you might want to
perform various kinds of censuses on your animals.

</P>
<P>
Counting the total number of animals you have is the same question as ``How
many rows are in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table?'' because there is one record per pet.
The <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> function counts the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> results, so
the query to count your animals looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        9 |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Earlier, you retrieved the names of the people who owned pets.  You can
use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> if you want to find out how many pets each owner has:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+
| Benny  |        2 |
| Diane  |        2 |
| Gwen   |        3 |
| Harold |        2 |
+--------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to group together all records for each
<CODE>owner</CODE>.  Without it, all you get is an error message:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(owner) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140 at line 1: Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>COUNT()</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> are useful for characterizing your
data in various ways.  The following examples show different ways to
perform animal census operations.

</P>
<P>
Number of animals per species:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
+---------+----------+
| species | COUNT(*) |
+---------+----------+
| bird    |        2 |
| cat     |        2 |
| dog     |        3 |
| hamster |        1 |
| snake   |        1 |
+---------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Number of animals per sex:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY sex;
+------+----------+
| sex  | COUNT(*) |
+------+----------+
| NULL |        1 |
| f    |        4 |
| m    |        4 |
+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
(In this output, <CODE>NULL</CODE> indicates sex unknown.)

</P>
<P>
Number of animals per combination of species and sex:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| bird    | NULL |        1 |
| bird    | f    |        1 |
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
| hamster | f    |        1 |
| snake   | m    |        1 |
+---------+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
You need not retrieve an entire table when you use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.  For
example, the previous query, when performed just on dogs and cats, looks like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat"
    -&#62; GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
+---------+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you wanted the number of animals per sex only for known-sex animals:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE sex IS NOT NULL
    -&#62; GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| bird    | f    |        1 |
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
| hamster | f    |        1 |

<P>
<A NAME="IDX391"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>pet</CODE> table keeps track of which pets you have.  If you want to
record other information about them, such as events in their lives like
visits to the vet or when litters are born, you need another table.  What
should this table look like? It needs:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To contain the pet name so you know which animal each event pertains
to.

<LI>

A date so you know when the event occurred.

<LI>

A field to describe the event.

<LI>

An event type field, if you want to be able to categorize events.
</UL>

<P>
Given these considerations, the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement for the
<CODE>event</CODE> table might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE event (name VARCHAR(20), date DATE,
    -&#62; type VARCHAR(15), remark VARCHAR(255));
</PRE>

<P>
As with the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, it's easiest to load the initial records
by creating a tab-delimited text file containing the information:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>Fluffy </TD><TD> 1995-05-15 </TD><TD> litter </TD><TD> 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Whistler </TD><TD> 1998-12-09 </TD><TD> birthday </TD><TD> First birthday
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Load the records like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "event.txt" INTO TABLE event;
</PRE>

<P>
Based on what you've learned from the queries you've run on the <CODE>pet</CODE>
table, you should be able to perform retrievals on the records in the
<CODE>event</CODE> table; the principles are the same.  But when is the
<CODE>event</CODE> table by itself insufficient to answer questions you might ask?

</P>
<P>
Suppose you want to find out the ages of each pet when they had their
litters.  The <CODE>event</CODE> table indicates when this occurred, but to
calculate the age of the mother, you need her birth date.  Because that is
stored in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, you need both tables for the query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT pet.name, (TO_DAYS(date) - TO_DAYS(birth))/365 AS age, remark
    -&#62; FROM pet, event
    -&#62; WHERE pet.name = event.name AND type = "litter";
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| name   | age  | remark                      |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| Fluffy | 2.27 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
| Buffy  | 4.12 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
| Buffy  | 5.10 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There are several things to note about this query:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause lists two tables because the query needs to pull
information from both of them.

<LI>

When combining (joining) information from multiple tables, you need to
specify how records in one table can be matched to records in the other.
This is easy because they both have a <CODE>name</CODE> column.  The query uses
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to match up records in the two tables based on the
<CODE>name</CODE> values.

<LI>

Because the <CODE>name</CODE> column occurs in both tables, you must be specific
about which table you mean when referring to the column.  This is done
by prepending the table name to the column name.
</UL>

<P>
You need not have two different tables to perform a join.  Sometimes it is
useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in a table
to other records in that same table.  For example, to find breeding pairs
among your pets, you can join the <CODE>pet</CODE> table with itself to pair up
males and females of like species:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
    -&#62; FROM pet AS p1, pet AS p2
    -&#62; WHERE p1.species = p2.species AND p1.sex = "f" AND p2.sex = "m";
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
| Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
| Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this query, we specify aliases for the table name in order
to refer to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table
each column reference is associated with.

</P>

</P>
<P>
What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the structure of
a given table is (for example, what its columns are called)?  MySQL
addresses this problem through several statements that provide information
about the databases and tables it supports.

</P>
<P>
You have already seen <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>, which lists the databases
managed by the server.  To find out which database is currently selected,
use the <CODE>DATABASE()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATABASE();
+------------+
| DATABASE() |
+------------+
| menagerie  |
+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you haven't selected any database yet, the result is blank.

</P>
<P>
To find out what tables the current database contains (for example, when
you're not sure about the name of a table), use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| event               |
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>
command is useful; it displays information about each of a table's columns:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |

| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>Field</CODE> indicates the column name, <CODE>Type</CODE> is the data type for
the column, <CODE>Null</CODE> indicates whether or not the column can contain
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, <CODE>Key</CODE> indicates whether or not the column is
indexed, and <CODE>Default</CODE> specifies the column's default value.

</P>
<P>
If you have indexes on a table,
<CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE> produces information about them.

</P>
<P>
Here are examples of how to solve some common problems with
MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Some of the examples use the table <CODE>shop</CODE> to hold the price of each
article (item number) for certain traders (dealers).  Supposing that each
trader has a single fixed price per article, then (<CODE>article</CODE>,
<CODE>dealer</CODE>) is a primary key for the records.

</P>
<P>
Start the command line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> and select a database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql your-database-name
</PRE>

<P>
(In most MySQL installations, you can use the database-name 'test').

</P>
<P>
You can create the example table as:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE shop (
 article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
 dealer  CHAR(20)                 DEFAULT ''     NOT NULL,
 price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY(article, dealer));

INSERT INTO shop VALUES
(1,'A',3.45),(1,'B',3.99),(2,'A',10.99),(3,'B',1.45),(3,'C',1.69),
(3,'D',1.25),(4,'D',19.95);
</PRE>

<P>
Okay, so the example data is:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM shop;

+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | A      |  3.45 |
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | B      |  1.45 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="example-Maximum-column" HREF="manual_toc.html#example-Maximum-column">3.5.1  The Maximum Value for a Column</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
In ANSI SQL this is easily done with a sub-query:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop)
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL (which does not yet have sub-selects), just do it in
two steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the maximum price value from the table with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.
<LI>

Using this value compile the actual query:

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=19.95
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Another solution is to sort all rows descending by price and only
get the first row using the MySQL specific <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  If there are several most expensive articles (for example, each 19.95)
the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> solution shows only one of them!

<PRE>
SELECT article, MAX(price) AS price

+---------+-------+
| article | price |
+---------+-------+
|    0001 |  3.99 |
|    0002 | 10.99 |

<P>
``For each article, find the dealer(s) with the most expensive price.''

</P>
<P>
In ANSI SQL, I'd do it with a sub-query like this:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop s1
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
              FROM shop s2
              WHERE s1.article = s2.article);
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL it's best do it in several steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the list of (article,maxprice).
<LI>

For each article get the corresponding rows that have the stored maximum
price.
</OL>

<P>
This can easily be done with a temporary table:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp (
        article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
        price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL);

LOCK TABLES shop read;

INSERT INTO tmp SELECT article, MAX(price) FROM shop GROUP BY article;

SELECT shop.article, dealer, shop.price FROM shop, tmp

``Can it be done with a single query?''

</P>
<P>
Yes, but only by using a quite inefficient trick that I call the
``MAX-CONCAT trick'':

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article,
       SUBSTRING( MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 7) AS dealer,
  0.00+LEFT(      MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 6) AS price
FROM   shop
GROUP BY article;

|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The last example can, of course, be made a bit more efficient by doing the
splitting of the concatenated column in the client.

<H3><A NAME="example-user-variables" HREF="manual_toc.html#example-user-variables">3.5.5  Using user variables</A></H3>

You can use MySQL user variables to remember results without
having to store them in temporary variables in the client.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Variables">6.1.4  User Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
For example, to find the articles with the highest and lowest price you
can do:

</P>

<PRE>
select @min_price:=min(price),@max_price:=max(price) from shop;
select * from shop where price=@min_price or price=@max_price;

You don't need foreign keys to join 2 tables.

</P>
<P>
The only thing MySQL doesn't do is <CODE>CHECK</CODE> to make sure that
the keys you use really exist in the table(s) you're referencing and it
doesn't automatically delete rows from table with a foreign key
definition. If you use your keys like normal, it'll work just fine:

MySQL doesn't yet optimize when you search on two different
keys combined with <CODE>OR</CODE> (Searching on one key with different <CODE>OR</CODE>
parts is optimized quite good):

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1'
OR  field2_index = '1'
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that we haven't yet had time to come up with an efficient
way to handle this in the general case. (The <CODE>AND</CODE> handling is,
in comparison, now completely general and works very well).

</P>
<P>
For the moment you can solve this very efficiently by using a
<CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table. This type of optimization is also very good if
you are using very complicated queries where the SQL server does the
optimizations in the wrong order.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1';
INSERT INTO tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
SELECT * from tmp;
DROP TABLE tmp;

<P>
The above way to solve this query is in effect an <CODE>UNION</CODE> of two queries.

The following shows an idea of how you can use the bit group functions
to calculate the number of days per month a user has visited a web page.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (year YEAR(4), month INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL, day INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL);                                                            
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2000,1,1),(2000,1,20),(2000,1,30),(2000,2,2),(2000,2,23),(2000,2,23);

SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_OR(1&#60;&#60;day)) AS days FROM t1 GROUP BY year,month;

Which returns:

+------+-------+------+
| year | month | days |
+------+-------+------+
| 2000 |    01 |    3 |
| 2000 |    02 |    2 |

The above calculates how many different days was used for a given
year/month combination, with automatic removal of duplicate entries.

</P>
<P>
In the previous sections, you used <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively to enter
queries and view the results.  You can also run <CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch
mode.  To do this, put the commands you want to run in a file, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its input from the file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to specify connection parameters on the command line, the
command might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p &#60; batch-file
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>mysql</CODE> this way, you are creating a script file, then
executing the script.

</P>
<P>
Why use a script?  Here are a few reasons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run a query repeatedly (say, every day or every week), making it a
script allows you to avoid retyping it each time you execute it.

<LI>

You can generate new queries from existing ones that are similar by copying
and editing script files.

<LI>

Batch mode can also be useful while you're developing a query, particularly
for multiple-line commands or multiple-statement sequences of commands.  If
you make a mistake, you don't have to retype everything.  Just edit your
script to correct the error, then tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute it again.

<LI>

If you have a query that produces a lot of output, you can run the output
through a pager rather than watching it scroll off the top of your screen:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file | more
</PRE>

<LI>

You can catch the output in a file for further processing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file &#62; mysql.out
</PRE>

<LI>

You can distribute your script to other people so they can run the commands,
too.

<LI>

Some situations do not allow for interactive use, for example, when you run
a query from a <CODE>cron</CODE> job.  In this case, you must use batch mode.
</UL>

<P>
The default output format is different (more concise) when you run
<CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch mode than when you use it interactively.  For
example, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT species FROM pet</CODE> looks like
this when run interactively:

</P>

<PRE>
+---------+
| species |
+---------+
| bird    |
| cat     |
| dog     |
| hamster |
| snake   |
+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
But like this when run in batch mode:

</P>

<PRE>
species
bird
cat
dog
hamster
snake
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to get the interactive output format in batch mode, use
<CODE>mysql -t</CODE>.  To echo to the output the commands that are executed, use
<CODE>mysql -vvv</CODE>.

At Analytikerna and Lentus, we have been doing the systems and field work
for a big research project. This project is a collaboration between the
Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet Stockholm
and the Section on Clinical Research in Aging and Psychology at the
University of Southern California.

</P>
<P>
The project involves a screening part where all twins in Sweden older
than 65 years are interviewed by telephone. Twins who meet certain
criteria are passed on to the next stage. In this latter stage, twins who
want to participate are visited by a doctor/nurse team. Some of the
examinations include physical and neuropsychological examination,
laboratory testing, neuroimaging, psychological status assessment, and family
history collection. In addition, data are collected on medical and
environmental risk factors.

<P>
Some explanations:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>concat(p1.id, p1.tvab) + 0 as tvid</CODE>
<DD>
We want to sort on the concatenated <CODE>id</CODE> and <CODE>tvab</CODE> in
numerical order. Adding <CODE>0</CODE> to the result causes MySQL to
treat the result as a number.
<DT>column <CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a pair of twins. It is a key in all tables.
<DT>column <CODE>tvab</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a twin in a pair. It has a value of <CODE>1</CODE> or <CODE>2</CODE>.
<DT>column <CODE>ptvab</CODE>
<DD>
This is an inverse of <CODE>tvab</CODE>. When <CODE>tvab</CODE> is <CODE>1</CODE> this is
<CODE>2</CODE>, and vice versa. It exists to save typing and to make it easier for
MySQL to optimize the query.
</DL>

<P>
This query demonstrates, among other things, how to do lookups on a
table from the same table with a join (<CODE>p1</CODE> and <CODE>p2</CODE>). In the example, this
is used to check whether a twin's partner died before the age of 65. If so,
the row is not returned.

</P>
<P>
All of the above exist in all tables with twin-related information. We
have a key on both <CODE>id,tvab</CODE> (all tables), and <CODE>id,ptvab</CODE>
(<CODE>person_data</CODE>) to make queries faster.

</P>
<P>
On our production machine (A 200MHz UltraSPARC), this query returns
about 150-200 rows and takes less than one second.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> accepts the following command-line options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--ansi</CODE>
<DD>
Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.4.3  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<DT><CODE>-b, --basedir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved relative to 
this.

<DT><CODE>--big-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on file.  It solves
most 'table full' errors, but also slows down the queries where
in-memory tables would suffice.  Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL is
able to solve it automatically by using memory for small temporary
tables and switching to disk tables where necessary.

<DT><CODE>--bind-address=IP</CODE>
<DD>
IP address to bind to.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--chroot=path</CODE>
<DD>
Chroot <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon during startup.  Recommended security measure. It will
somewhat limit <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> 
though.

<DT><CODE>--core-file</CODE>
<DD>
Write a core file if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies.  For some systems you must also
specify <CODE>--core-file-size</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.

<DT><CODE>-h, --datadir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to the database root.

<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=charset</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--default-table-type=type</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default table type for tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<DT><CODE>--debug[...]=</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you can use this 
option to get a trace file of what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is doing. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

<DT><CODE>--delay-key-write-for-all-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Don't flush key buffers between writes for any <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--enable-locking</CODE>
<DD>
Enable system locking.  Note that if you use this option on a system
which a not fully working lockd() (as on Linux) you will easily get
mysqld to deadlock.

<DT><CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>
<DD>
Enable support for named pipes (only on NT/Win2000/XP).

<DT><CODE>-T, --exit-info</CODE>
<DD>
This is a bit mask of different flags one can use for debugging the
mysqld server;  One should not use this option if one doesn't know
exactly what it does!

<DT><CODE>--flush</CODE>
<DD>
Flush all changes to disk after each SQL command.  Normally MySQL
only does a write of all changes to disk after each SQL command and lets
the operating system handle the syncing to disk.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display short help and exit.

<DT><CODE>--init-file=file</CODE>
<DD>
Read SQL commands from this file at startup.

<DT><CODE>-L, --language=...</CODE>
<DD>
Client error messages in given language.  May be given as a full path.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.

<DT><CODE>-l, --log[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log connections and queries to file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-isam[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all ISAM/MyISAM changes to file (only used when debugging ISAM/MyISAM).

<DT><CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all queries that have taken more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds to
execute to file.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-update[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log updates to <CODE>file.#</CODE> where <CODE>#</CODE> is a unique number if not given.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-long-format</CODE>
<DD>
Log some extra information to update log.  If you are using
<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE> then queries that are not using indexes are logged
to the slow query log.

<DT><CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
<DD>
Table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>/<CODE>DELETE</CODE>/<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>)
will have lower priority than selects.  It can also be done via 
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> to lower 
the priority of only one query, or by
<CODE>SET OPTION SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE> to change the priority in one
thread.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A>.

<DT><CODE>--memlock</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process in memory.  This works only if your
system supports the <CODE>mlockall()</CODE> system call (like Solaris).  This
may help if you have a problem where the operating system is causing
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to swap on disk.

<DT><CODE>--myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]] where option is any combination</CODE>
<DD>
of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>, <CODE>BACKUP</CODE>, <CODE>FORCE</CODE> or <CODE>QUICK</CODE>.  You can
also set this explicitely to <CODE>""</CODE> if you want to disable this
option. If this option is used, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will on open check if the
table is marked as crashed or if if the table wasn't closed properly.
(The last option only works if you are running with
<CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>).  If this is the case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will run
check on the table. If the table was corrupted, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
attempt to repair it.

The following options affects how the repair works.

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>DEFAULT </TD><TD> The same as not giving any option to
                    <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>BACKUP </TD><TD> If the data table was changed during recover, save a
                    backup of the <TT>`table_name.MYD'</TT> data file as 
                    <TT>`table_name-datetime.BAK'</TT>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>FORCE </TD><TD> Run recover even if we will loose more than one row
                    from the .MYD file.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>QUICK </TD><TD> Don't check the rows in the table if there isn't any
                    delete blocks.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Before a table is automatically repaired, MySQL will add a note
about this in the error log.  If you want to be able to recover from most
things without user intervention, you should use the options
<CODE>BACKUP,FORCE</CODE>.  This will force a repair of a table even if some rows
would be deleted, but it will keep the old data file as a backup so that
you can later examine what happened.

<DT><CODE>--pid-file=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to pid file used by <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to listen for TCP/IP connections.

<DT><CODE>-o, --old-protocol</CODE>
<DD>
Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility with some very old clients.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.20">2.5.3  Upgrading from Version 3.20 to Version 3.21</A>.

<DT><CODE>--one-thread</CODE>
<DD>
Only use one thread (for debugging under Linux).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">G.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>-O, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Give a variable a value. <CODE>--help</CODE> lists variables.  You can find a full
description for all variables in the <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> section in this
manual.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.5.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.  The tuning server parameters section includes
information of how to optimize these.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>
<DD>
Skip some optimize stages.  Implies <CODE>--skip-delay-key-write</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any privileges.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, a user can't create new users with the GRANT
command, if the user doesn't have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege to the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table or any column in this table.

<DT><CODE>--skip-concurrent-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Turn off the ability to select and insert at the same time on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables. (This is only to be used if you think you have found a bug in this
feature).

<DT><CODE>--skip-delay-key-write</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore the <CODE>delay_key_write</CODE> option for all tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all.  This
gives everyone <EM>full access</EM> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>
<DD>
Never use host name cache for faster name-ip resolution, but query DNS server
on every connect instead.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use system locking.  To use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> you must
shut down the server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Stability">1.1.7  How Stable Is MySQL?</A>.  Note that in MySQL Version
3.23 you can use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>CHECK</CODE> to repair/check <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant tables
must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't listen for TCP/IP connections at all.  All interaction with 
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via Unix sockets.  This option is highly 
recommended for systems where only local requests are allowed.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-new</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use new, possible wrong routines.  Implies <CODE>--skip-delay-key-write</CODE>.
This will also set default table type to <CODE>ISAM</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ISAM">7.3  ISAM Tables</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
<DD>
Don't delete or rename files that a symlinked file in the data directory
points to.

<DT><CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, all programs
will check the memory for overruns for every memory allocation and memory
freeing.  As this checking is very slow, you can avoid this, when you don't
need memory checking, by using this option.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands, unless the user has <STRONG>process</STRONG>
privilege.

<DT><CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write stack traces.  This option is useful when you are running
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> under a debugger. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">G.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE>
<DD>
Disable using thread priorities for faster response time.

<DT><CODE>--socket=path</CODE>
<DD>
Socket file to use for local connections instead of default
<CODE>/tmp/mysql.sock</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--sql-mode=option[,option[,option...]]</CODE>
<DD>
Option can be any combination of: <CODE>REAL_AS_FLOAT</CODE>,
<CODE>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</CODE>, <CODE>ANSI_QUOTES</CODE>, <CODE>IGNORE_SPACE</CODE>,
<CODE>SERIALIZE</CODE>, <CODE>ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</CODE>.  It can also be empty
(<CODE>""</CODE>) if you want to reset this.

By specifying all of the above options is same as using --ansi.
With this option one can turn on only needed SQL modes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.4.3  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<DT><CODE>transaction-isolation= { READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE }</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the default transaction isolation level.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.3  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-t, --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path for temporary files. It may be useful if your default <CODE>/tmp</CODE>
directory resides on a partition too small to hold temporary tables.

<DT><CODE>-u, --user=user_name</CODE>
<DD>
Run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon as user <CODE>user_name</CODE>.  This option is
<EM>mandatory</EM> when starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-W, --warnings</CODE>
<DD>
Print out warnings like <CODE>Aborted connection...</CODE> to the <CODE>.err</CODE> file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Communication_errors">A.2.9  Communication Errors / Aborted Connection</A>.

MySQL can, since Version 3.22, read default startup options for the

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DATADIR</CODE> is the MySQL data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary installation or
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source installation).  Note that this is the
directory that was specified at configuration time, not the one specified
with <CODE>--datadir</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up!  (<CODE>--datadir</CODE> has no
effect on where the server looks for option files, because it looks for them
before it processes any command-line arguments.)

</P>

MySQL reads default options from the following files on Windows:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Filename</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>

</TABLE>

<P>
Note that on Windows, you should specify all paths with <CODE>/</CODE> instead of
<CODE>\</CODE>. If you use <CODE>\</CODE>, you need to specify this twice, as
<CODE>\</CODE> is the escape character in MySQL.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX422"></A>
MySQL tries to read option files in the order listed above.  If
multiple option files exist, an option specified in a file read later takes
precedence over the same option specified in a file read earlier.  Options
specified on the command line take precedence over options specified in any
option file.  Some options can be specified using environment variables.
Options specified on the command line or in option files take precedence over
environment variable values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following programs support option files:  <CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, and <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can use option files to specify any long option that a program supports!
Run the program with <CODE>--help</CODE> to get a list of available options.

</P>
<P>
An option file can contain lines of the following forms:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>#comment</CODE>
<DD>
Comment lines start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>. Empty lines are ignored.

<DT><CODE>[group]</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>group</CODE> is the name of the program or group for which you want to set
options.  After a group line, any <CODE>option</CODE> or <CODE>set-variable</CODE> lines
apply to the named group until the end of the option file or another group
line is given.

<DT><CODE>option</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option</CODE> on the command line.

<DT><CODE>option=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option=value</CODE> on the command line.

<DT><CODE>set-variable = variable=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--set-variable variable=value</CODE> on the command line.
This syntax must be used to set a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variable.
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>client</CODE> group allows you to specify options that apply to all
MySQL clients (not <CODE>mysqld</CODE>). This is the perfect group to use
to specify the password you use to connect to the server.  (But make
sure the option file is readable and writable only by yourself.)

</P>
<P>
Note that for options and values, all leading and trailing blanks are
automatically deleted.  You may use the escape sequences <SAMP>`\b'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`\t'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`\s'</SAMP> in your value string
(<SAMP>`\s'</SAMP> == blank).

</P>

Here is a typical global option file:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

[mysqld]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
set-variable = key_buffer_size=16M
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=1M

[mysqldump]

</PRE>

<P>
Here is typical user option file:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
# The following password will be sent to all standard MySQL clients
password=my_password

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash
set-variable = connect_timeout=2

[mysqlhotcopy]

If you have a source distribution, you will find sample configuration
files named <TT>`my-xxxx.cnf'</TT> in the <TT>`support-files'</TT> directory.
If you have a binary distribution, look in the <TT>`DIR/support-files'</TT>
directory, where <CODE>DIR</CODE> is the pathname to the MySQL
installation directory (typically <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>).  Currently
there are sample configuration files for small, medium, large, and very
large systems.  You can copy <TT>`my-xxxx.cnf'</TT> to your home directory
(rename the copy to <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>) to experiment with this.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL clients that support option files support the
following options:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>--no-defaults </TD><TD> Don't read any option files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>--print-defaults </TD><TD> Print the program name and all options that it will get.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>--defaults-file=full-path-to-default-file </TD><TD> Only use the given configuration file.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>--defaults-extra-file=full-path-to-default-file </TD><TD> Read this configuration file after the global configuration file but before the user configuration file.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Note that the above options must be first on the command line to work!
<CODE>--print-defaults</CODE> may however be used directly after the
<CODE>--defaults-xxx-file</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
Note for developers:  Option file handling is implemented simply by
processing all matching options (that is, options in the appropriate group)
before any command-line arguments. This works nicely for programs that use
the last instance of an option that is specified multiple times. If you have
an old program that handles multiply-specified options this way but doesn't
read option files, you need add only two lines to give it that capability.
Check the source code of any of the standard MySQL clients to see
how to do this.

</P>
<P>
In shell scripts you can use the <TT>`my_print_defaults'</TT> command to parse the
config files:

</P>

<PRE>

shell&#62; my_print_defaults client mysql
--port=3306
--socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
--no-auto-rehash

The above output contains all options for the groups 'client' and 'mysql'.

In some cases you may want to have many different <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemons

a new version of MySQL for testing together with an old version
that is in production.  Another case is when you want to give different

One way to get a new server running is by starting it with a different

<P>
The above is the quick and dirty way that one commonly uses for testing.
The nice thing with this is that all connections you do in the above shell
will automatically be directed to the new running server!

</P>
<P>
If you need to do this more permanently, you should create an option
file for each server. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.  In your startup script that
is executed at boot time (mysql.server?) you should specify for both
servers:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>safe_mysqld --default-file=path-to-option-file</CODE>

</P>
<P>
At least the following options should be different per server:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>port=#</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>socket=path</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>pid-file=path</CODE>

There are circumstances when you might want to run multiple servers on the same
machine.  For example, you might want to test a new MySQL release
while leaving your existing production setup undisturbed.  Or you might
be an Internet service provider that wants to provide independent
MySQL installations for different customers.

</P>
<P>
If you want to run multiple servers, the easiest way is to compile the servers
with different TCP/IP ports and socket files so they are not
both listening to the same TCP/IP port or socket file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_multi">4.7.3  mysqld_multi, program for managing multiple MySQL servers</A>.

</P>
<P>
Assume an existing server is configured for the default port number and
socket file.  Then configure the new server with a <CODE>configure</CODE> command
something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure  --with-tcp-port=port_number \
             --with-unix-socket-path=file_name \
             --prefix=/usr/local/mysql-3.22.9
</PRE>

<P>
Here <CODE>port_number</CODE> and <CODE>file_name</CODE> should be different than the
default port number and socket file pathname, and the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> value
should specify an installation directory different than the one under which
the existing MySQL installation is located.

</P>
<P>
You can check the socket used by any currently executing MySQL server
with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h hostname --port=port_number variables
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you specify ``<CODE>localhost</CODE>'' as a hostname, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
will default to using Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
If you have a MySQL server running on the port you used, you will
get a list of some of the most important configurable variables in
MySQL, including the socket name.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to recompile a new MySQL server just to start with
a different port and socket.  You can change the port and socket to be used
by specifying them at run time as options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld --socket=file_name --port=port_number
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> can also take <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> (or <CODE>mysqld</CODE>)
as an argument and pass the options from a configuration file to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> and further to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you run the new server on the same database directory as another
server with logging enabled, you should also specify the name of the log
files to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log</CODE>, <CODE>--log-update</CODE>, or
<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>.  Otherwise, both servers may be trying to
write to the same log file.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>WARNING</STRONG>: Normally you should never have two servers that update
data in the same database!  If your OS doesn't support fault-free system
locking, this may lead to unpleasant surprises!

</P>
<P>
If you want to use another database directory for the second server, you
can use the <CODE>--datadir=path</CODE> option to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> also that starting several MySQL servers
(<CODE>mysqlds</CODE>) in different machines and letting them access one data
directory over <CODE>NFS</CODE> is generally a <STRONG>BAD IDEA</STRONG>! The problem
is that the <CODE>NFS</CODE> will become the bottleneck with the speed. It is
not meant for such use. And last but not least, you would still have to
come up with a solution how to make sure that two or more <CODE>mysqlds</CODE>
are not interfering with each other. At the moment there is no platform
that would 100% reliable do the file locking (<CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon
usually) in every situation. Yet there would be one more possible risk
with <CODE>NFS</CODE>; it would make the work even more complicated for
<CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon to handle. So make it easy for your self and forget
about the idea. The working solution is to have one computer with an
operating system that efficiently handles threads and have several CPUs
in it.

<P>
When you want to connect to a MySQL server that is running with
a different port than the port that is compiled into your client, you
can use one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start the client with <CODE>--host 'hostname' --port=port_number</CODE> to connect
with TCP/IP, or <CODE>[--host localhost] --socket=file_name</CODE> to connect via
a Unix socket.

<LI>

In your C or Perl programs, you can give the port or socket arguments
when connecting to the MySQL server.

<LI>

If your are using the Perl <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> module you can read the options
from the MySQL option files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.


<PRE>
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf"
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect($dsn, $user, $password);
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
Set the <CODE>MYSQL_UNIX_PORT</CODE> and <CODE>MYSQL_TCP_PORT</CODE> environment variables
to point to the Unix socket and TCP/IP port before you start your clients.
If you normally use a specific socket or port, you should place commands
to set these environment variables in your <TT>`.login'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX438"></A>
Specify the default socket and TCP/IP port in the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your

MySQL has an advanced but non-standard security/privilege
system.  This section describes how it works.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="General_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#General_security">4.2.1  General Security Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet
should read this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

</P>
<P>
In discussing security, we emphasize the necessity of fully protecting the
entire server host (not simply the MySQL server) against all types
of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering, playback, and denial of
service. We do not cover all aspects of availability and fault tolerance
here.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that a user may attempt to
perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts
discussed here are not specific to MySQL at all; the same
general ideas apply to almost all applications.

</P>
<P>
When running MySQL, follow these guidelines whenever possible:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

DON'T EVER GIVE ANYONE (EXCEPT THE MySQL ROOT USER) ACCESS TO THE
<CODE>user</CODE> TABLE IN THE <CODE>mysql</CODE> DATABASE!  The encrypted password
is the real password in MySQL. If you know the password listed in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table for a given user, you can easily log in as that
user if you have access to the host listed for that account.

<LI>

Learn the MySQL access privilege system. The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands are used for controlling access to MySQL. Do
not grant any more privileges than necessary. Never grant privileges to all
hosts.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try <CODE>mysql -u root</CODE>. If you are able to connect successfully to the
server without being asked for a password, you have problems. Anyone
can connect to your MySQL server as the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user with full privileges!
Review the MySQL installation instructions, paying particular
attention to the item about setting a <CODE>root</CODE> password.
<LI>

Use the command <CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> and check to see who has access to
what. Remove those privileges that are not necessary using the <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>
command.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not keep any plain-text passwords in your database. When your
computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list of
passwords and use them. Instead use <CODE>MD5()</CODE> or another one-way
hashing function.
<LI>

Do not choose passwords from dictionaries. There are special programs to
break them. Even passwords like ``xfish98'' are very bad.  Much better is
``duag98'' which contains the same word ``fish'' but typed one key to the
left on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Another method is to use ``Mhall'' which
is taken from the first characters of each word in the sentence ``Mary had
a little lamb.'' This is easy to remember and type, but difficult to guess
for someone who does not know it.
<LI>

Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of all types of
exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the firewall or in
a demilitarized zone (DMZ).

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such as
<CODE>nmap</CODE>. MySQL uses port 3306 by default. This port should
be inaccessible from untrusted hosts. Another simple way to check whether
or not your MySQL port is open is to try the following command
from some remote machine, where <CODE>server_host</CODE> is the hostname of
your MySQL server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; telnet server_host 3306
</PRE>

If you get a connection and some garbage characters, the port is
open, and should be closed on your firewall or router, unless you really
have a good reason to keep it open. If <CODE>telnet</CODE> just hangs or the
connection is refused, everything is OK; the port is blocked.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not trust any data entered by your users. They can try to trick your
code by entering special or escaped character sequences in Web forms,
URLs, or whatever application you have built. Be sure that your
application remains secure if a user enters something like ``<CODE>; DROP
DATABASE mysql;</CODE>''. This is an extreme example, but large security leaks
and data loss may occur as a result of hackers using similar techniques,
if you do not prepare for them.

Also remember to check numeric data. A common mistake is to protect only
strings. Sometimes people think that if a database contains only publicly
available data that it need not be protected. This is incorrect. At least
denial-of-service type attacks can be performed on such
databases. The simplest way to protect from this type of attack is to use
apostrophes around the numeric constants: <CODE>SELECT * FROM table
WHERE ID='234'</CODE> rather than <CODE>SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234</CODE>.
MySQL automatically converts this string to a number and
strips all non-numeric symbols from it.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

All Web applications:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to enter <SAMP>`''</SAMP> and <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> in all your Web forms. If you get any kind
of MySQL error, investigate the problem right away.
<LI>

Try to modify any dynamic URLs by adding <CODE>%22</CODE> (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>), <CODE>%23</CODE>
(<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>), and <CODE>%27</CODE> (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>) in the URL.
<LI>

Try to modify datatypes in dynamic URLs from numeric ones to character
ones containing characters from previous examples. Your application
should be safe against this and similar attacks.
<LI>

Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols instead of numbers in
numeric fields. Your application should remove them before passing them to
MySQL or your application should generate an error. Passing
unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous!
<LI>

Check data sizes before passing them to MySQL.
<LI>

Consider having your application connect to the database using a
different user name than the one you use for administrative purposes. Do
not give your applications any more access privileges than they need.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of PHP:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>addslashes()</CODE> function.

As of PHP 4.0.3, a <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function is available
that is based on the function of the same name in the MySQL C API.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of MySQL C API:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> API call.

<LI>

Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet. These data are
accessible to everyone who has the time and ability to intercept it and use
it for their own purposes. Instead, use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or
SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL connections as of Version 3.23.9.
SSH port-forwarding can be used to create an encrypted (and compressed)
tunnel for the communication.
<LI>

Learn to use the <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> and <CODE>strings</CODE> utilities. For most cases,
you can check whether or not MySQL data streams are unencrypted
by issuing a command like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
</PRE>

(This works under Linux and should work with small modifications under
other systems).  Warning: If you do not see data this doesn't always
actually mean that it is encrypted. If you need high security, you should
consult with a security expert.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX444"></A>
<A NAME="IDX445"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you connect to a MySQL server, you normally should use a
password.  The password is not transmitted in clear text over the
connection, however the encryption algorithm is not very strong, and
with some effort a clever attacker can crack the password if he is able
to sniff the traffic between the client and the server. If the
connection between the client and the server goes through an untrusted
network, you should use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the
communication.

</P>
<P>
All other information is transferred as text that can be read by anyone
who is able to watch the connection.  If you are concerned about this,
you can use the compressed protocol (in MySQL Version 3.22 and above)
to make things much harder.  To make things even more secure you should use 
<CODE>ssh</CODE>.  You can find an open source <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at 
<a HREF="http://www.openssh.org">http://www.openssh.org</a>, and a commercial <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at 
<a HREF="http://www.ssh.com">http://www.ssh.com</a>.  With this, you can get an encrypted TCP/IP 
connection between a MySQL server and a MySQL client.

</P>
<P>
To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use passwords for all MySQL users. Remember that anyone can log in
as any other person as simply as <CODE>mysql -u other_user db_name</CODE> if
<CODE>other_user</CODE> has no password.  It is common behavior with client/server
applications that the client may specify any user name.  You can change the
password of all users by editing the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script before
you run it, or only the password for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user like
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
           WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<LI>

Don't run the MySQL daemon as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user.  This is
very dangerous, because any user with <CODE>FILE</CODE> privileges will be able
to create files as <CODE>root</CODE> (for example, <CODE>~root/.bashrc</CODE>). To
prevent this, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will refuse to run as <CODE>root</CODE> unless it
is specified directly using a <CODE>--user=root</CODE> option.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user instead.
You can also create a new Unix user <CODE>mysql</CODE> to make everything
even more secure.  If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user,
you don't need to change the <CODE>root</CODE> user name in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, because MySQL user names have nothing to do with Unix
user names.  To start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user, add a <CODE>user</CODE>
line that specifies the user name to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the
server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
user=mysql
</PRE>

This will cause the server to start as the designated user whether you
start it manually or by using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.
For more details, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

<LI>

Don't support symlinks to tables (This can be disabled with the
<CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> option. This is especially important if you run
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root as anyone that has write access to the mysqld data
directories could then delete any file in the system!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

<LI>

Check that the Unix user that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as is the only user with
read/write privileges in the database directories.

<LI>

Don't give the <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege to all users.  The output of
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> shows the text of the currently executing
queries, so any user who is allowed to execute that command might be able to
see if another user issues an <CODE>UPDATE user SET
password=PASSWORD('not_secure')</CODE> query.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> reserves an extra connection for users who have the
<STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege, so that a MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user can log
in and check things even if all normal connections are in use.

<LI>

Don't give the <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege to all users.  Any user that has this
privilege can write a file anywhere in the file system with the privileges of
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon!  To make this a bit safer, all files generated with
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> are readable to everyone, and you cannot
overwrite existing files.

<A NAME="IDX446"></A>
The <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege may also be used to read any file accessible
to the Unix user that the server runs as.  This could be abused, for example,
by using <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to load <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> into a table, which
can then be read with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't trust your DNS, you should use IP numbers instead of
hostnames in the grant tables. In any case, you should be very careful
about creating grant table entries using hostname values that contain
wild cards!

<LI>

If you want to restrict the number of connections for a single user, you
can do this by setting the <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE> variable in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges_options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges_options">4.2.3  Startup Options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Concerning Security</A></H3>

<P>
The following <CODE>mysqld</CODE> options affect security:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option,
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> returns only those databases for which the user has
some kind of privilege.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, an user can't create new users with the <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
command, if the user doesn't have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege to the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.  If you want to give a user access to just create
new users with those privileges that the user has right to grant, you should
give the user the following privilege:


<PRE>
GRANT INSERT(user) on mysql.user to 'user''hostname';
</PRE>

This will ensure that the user can't change any privilege columns directly,
but has to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command to give privileges to other users.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all. This
gives everyone <EM>full access</EM> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant
tables must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow TCP/IP connections over the network.  All connections to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via Unix sockets. This option is unsuitable for
systems that use MIT-pthreads, because the MIT-pthreads package doesn't
support Unix sockets.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option, the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> statement doesn't return anything.

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="What_Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_Privileges">4.2.4  What the Privilege System Does</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX447"></A>
<A NAME="IDX448"></A>
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>

</P>
<P>
The primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to
authenticate a user connecting from a given host, and to associate that user
with privileges on a database such as
<STRONG>select</STRONG>, <STRONG>insert</STRONG>, <STRONG>update</STRONG> and <STRONG>delete</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
Additional functionality includes the ability to have an anonymous user and
to grant privileges for MySQL-specific functions such as <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> and administrative operations.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges">4.2.5  How the Privilege System Works</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may do exactly the
things that they are supposed to be allowed to do.  When you connect to a
MySQL server, your identity is determined by <STRONG>the host from
which you connect</STRONG> and <STRONG>the user name you specify</STRONG>.  The system grants
privileges according to your identity and <STRONG>what you want to do</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL considers both your hostname and user name in identifying you
because there is little reason to assume that a given user name belongs to
the same person everywhere on the Internet.  For example, the user
<CODE>bill</CODE> who connects from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE> need not be the same
person as the user <CODE>bill</CODE> who connects from <CODE>microsoft.com</CODE>.
MySQL handles this by allowing you to distinguish users on different
hosts that happen to have the same name:  you can grant <CODE>bill</CODE> one set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>, and a different set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>microsoft.com</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL access control involves two stages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stage 1: The server checks whether or not you are even allowed to connect.

<LI>

Stage 2: Assuming you can connect, the server checks each request you issue
to see whether or not you have sufficient privileges to perform it.  For
example, if you try to select rows from a table in a database or drop a table
from the database, the server makes sure you have the <STRONG>select</STRONG>
privilege for the table or the <STRONG>drop</STRONG> privilege for the database.
</UL>

<P>
The server uses the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, and <CODE>host</CODE> tables in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database at both stages of access control.  The fields in these
grant tables are shown below:

<P>
Each grant table contains scope fields and privilege fields.

</P>
<P>
Scope fields determine the scope of each entry in the tables, that is, the
context in which the entry applies.  For example, a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> values of <CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE> and
<CODE>'bob'</CODE> would be used for authenticating connections made to the server
by <CODE>bob</CODE> from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE>.  Similarly, a <CODE>db</CODE>
table entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields of
<CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE>, <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'reports'</CODE> would be used when
<CODE>bob</CODE> connects from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> to access the
<CODE>reports</CODE> database.  The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables contain scope fields indicating tables or table/column combinations
to which each entry applies.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
For access-checking purposes, comparisons of <CODE>Host</CODE> values are
case insensitive.  <CODE>User</CODE>, <CODE>Password</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and
<CODE>Table_name</CODE> values are case sensitive.
<CODE>Column_name</CODE> values are case insensitive in MySQL Version
3.22.12 or later.

</P>
<P>
Privilege fields indicate the privileges granted by a table entry, that is,
what operations can be performed.  The server combines the information in the
various grant tables to form a complete description of a user's privileges.
The rules used to do this are described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.9  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.

<P>
Briefly, the server uses the grant tables like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields determine whether to allow or reject
incoming connections.  For allowed connections, any privileges granted in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table indicate the user's global (superuser) privileges.
These privileges apply to <STRONG>all</STRONG> databases on the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables are used together:


<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> table scope fields determine which users can access which
databases from which hosts.  The privilege fields determine which operations
are allowed.

<LI>

The <CODE>host</CODE> table is used as an extension of the <CODE>db</CODE> table when you
want a given <CODE>db</CODE> table entry to apply to several hosts.  For example,
if you want a user to be able to use a database from several hosts in
your network, leave the <CODE>Host</CODE> value empty in the user's <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry, then populate the <CODE>host</CODE> table with an entry for each of those
hosts.  This mechanism is described more detail in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.9  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables are similar to
the <CODE>db</CODE> table, but are more fine-grained: they apply at the
table and column levels rather than at the database level.
</UL>

<P>
Note that administrative privileges (<STRONG>reload</STRONG>, <STRONG>shutdown</STRONG>,
etc.) are specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  This is because
administrative operations are operations on the server itself and are not
database-specific, so there is no reason to list such privileges in the
other grant tables.  In fact, only the <CODE>user</CODE> table need
be consulted to determine whether or not you can perform an administrative
operation.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege is specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, too.
It is not an administrative privilege as such, but your ability to read or
write files on the server host is independent of the database you are
accessing.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server reads the contents of the grant tables once, when it
starts up.  Changes to the grant tables take effect as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the contents of the grant tables, it is a good idea to make
sure that your changes set up privileges the way you want.  For help in
diagnosing problems, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Access_denied">4.2.10  Causes of <CODE>Access denied</CODE> Errors</A>.  For advice on security issues,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A>.

</P>
<P>
A useful
diagnostic tool is the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script, which Yves Carlier has
provided for the MySQL distribution.  Invoke <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option to find out how it works.
Note that <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> checks access using only the <CODE>user</CODE>,
<CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  It does not check table- or column-level
privileges.

</P>

<P>
Information about user privileges is stored in the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database (that is, in the database named <CODE>mysql</CODE>).  The

<P>
The <STRONG>select</STRONG>, <STRONG>insert</STRONG>, <STRONG>update</STRONG>, and <STRONG>delete</STRONG>
privileges allow you to perform operations on rows in existing tables in
a database.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements require the <STRONG>select</STRONG> privilege only if they
actually retrieve rows from a table.  You can execute certain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements even without permission to access any of the databases on the
server.  For example, you could use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client as a simple
calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;
mysql&#62; SELECT PI()*2;
</PRE>

<P>
The <STRONG>index</STRONG> privilege allows you to create or drop (remove) indexes.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>alter</STRONG> privilege allows you to use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>create</STRONG> and <STRONG>drop</STRONG> privileges allow you to create new
databases and tables, or to drop (remove) existing databases and tables.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you grant the <STRONG>drop</STRONG> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database to a user, that user can drop the database in which the
MySQL access privileges are stored!

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege allows you to give to other users those
privileges you yourself possess.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege gives you permission to read and write files on
the server using the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE</CODE> statements.  Any user to whom this privilege is granted can read or
write any file that the MySQL server can read or write.

</P>
<P>
The remaining privileges are used for administrative operations, which are
performed using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> program.  The table below shows which
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> commands each administrative privilege allows you to
execute:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Privilege</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Commands permitted to privilege holders</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The <CODE>reload</CODE> command tells the server to re-read the grant tables.  The
<CODE>refresh</CODE> command flushes all tables and opens and closes the log
files.  <CODE>flush-privileges</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>reload</CODE>.  The other
<CODE>flush-*</CODE> commands perform functions similar to <CODE>refresh</CODE> but are
more limited in scope, and may be preferable in some instances.  For example,
if you want to flush just the log files, <CODE>flush-logs</CODE> is a better choice
than <CODE>refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>shutdown</CODE> command shuts down the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>processlist</CODE> command displays information about the threads
executing within the server.  The <CODE>kill</CODE> command kills server threads.
You can always display or kill your own threads, but you need the
<STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege to display or kill threads initiated by other
users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.4  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea in general to grant privileges only to those users who need
them, but you should exercise particular caution in granting certain
privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege allows users to give away their privileges to
other users.  Two users with different privileges and with the <STRONG>grant</STRONG>
privilege are able to combine privileges.

<LI>

The <STRONG>alter</STRONG> privilege may be used to subvert the privilege system
by renaming tables.

<LI>

The <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege can be abused to read any world-readable file on
the server into a database table, the contents of which can then be
accessed using <CODE>SELECT</CODE>. This includes the contents of all databases
hosted by the server!

<LI>

The <STRONG>shutdown</STRONG> privilege can be abused to deny service to other
users entirely, by terminating the server.

<LI>

The <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege can be used to view the plain text of
currently executing queries, including queries that set or change passwords.

<LI>

Privileges on the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can be used to change passwords
and other access privilege information.  (Passwords are stored
encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the plain
text password).  If they can access the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> password
column, they can use it to log into the MySQL server
for the given user.  (With sufficient privileges, the same user can
replace a password with a different one.)
</UL>

<P>
There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL
privilege system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied access.
That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then refuse the connection.

<LI>

You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop tables
in a database but not to create or drop the database itself.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL client programs generally require that you specify connection
parameters when you want to access a MySQL server: the host you want
to connect to, your user name, and your password.  For example, the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client can be started like this (optional arguments are enclosed
between <SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql [-h host_name] [-u user_name] [-pyour_pass]
</PRE>

<P>
Alternate forms of the <CODE>-h</CODE>, <CODE>-u</CODE>, and <CODE>-p</CODE> options are
<CODE>--host=host_name</CODE>, <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE>, and
<CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE>.  Note that there is <EM>no space</EM> between
<CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password=</CODE> and the password following it.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Specifying a password on the command line is not secure!
Any user on your system may then find out your password by typing a command
like: <CODE>ps auxww</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql</CODE> uses default values for connection parameters that are missing
from the command line:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The default hostname is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<LI>

The default user name is your Unix login name.

<LI>

No password is supplied if <CODE>-p</CODE> is missing.
</UL>

<P>
Thus, for a Unix user <CODE>joe</CODE>, the following commands are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost -u joe
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost
shell&#62; mysql -u joe
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Other MySQL clients behave similarly.

</P>
<P>
On Unix systems, you can specify different default values to be used when you
make a connection, so that you need not enter them on the command line each
time you invoke a client program.  This can be done in a couple of ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
You can specify connection parameters in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the
<TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> configuration file in your home directory.  The relevant
section of the file might look like this:


<PRE>
[client]
host=host_name
user=user_name
password=your_pass
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX458"></A>
<A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>
<A NAME="IDX461"></A>
<A NAME="IDX462"></A>
<A NAME="IDX463"></A>
You can specify connection parameters using environment variables.  The
host can be specified for <CODE>mysql</CODE> using <CODE>MYSQL_HOST</CODE>.  The
MySQL user name can be specified using <CODE>USER</CODE> (this is for
Windows only).  The password can be specified using <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>
(but this is insecure; see the next section).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether or not you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.  If not, the server
denies access to you completely.  Otherwise, the server accepts the
connection, then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

</P>
<P>
Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The host from which you connect

<LI>

Your MySQL user name
</UL>

<P>
Identity checking is performed using the three <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields
(<CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Password</CODE>).  The server accepts the
connection only if a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry matches your hostname and user
name, and you supply the correct password.

</P>
<P>
Values in the <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields may be specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value may be a hostname or an IP number, or <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>
to indicate the local host.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX468"></A>
You can use the wild-card characters <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> in the <CODE>Host</CODE>
field.

<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value of <CODE>'%'</CODE> matches any hostname.

<LI>

A blank <CODE>Host</CODE> value means that the privilege should be anded
with the entry in the <CODE>host</CODE> table that matches the given host name.
You can find more information about this in the next chapter.

<A NAME="IDX469"></A>
<LI>

As of MySQL Version 3.23, for <CODE>Host</CODE> values specified as 
IP numbers, you can specify a netmask indicating how many address bits to 
use for the network number. For example:


<PRE>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on db.* to david@'192.58.197.0/255.255.255.0';
</PRE>

This will allow everyone to connect from an IP where the following is true:


<PRE>
user_ip &#38; netmask = host_ip.
</PRE>

In the above example all IP:s in the interval 192.58.197.0 -
192.58.197.255 can connect to the MySQL server.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX470"></A>
Wild-card characters are not allowed in the <CODE>User</CODE> field, but you can
specify a blank value, which matches any name.  If the <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry that matches an incoming connection has a blank user name, the user is
considered to be the anonymous user (the user with no name), rather than the
name that the client actually specified.  This means that a blank user name
is used for all further access checking for the duration of the connection
(that is, during Stage 2).

<LI>

The <CODE>Password</CODE> field can be blank.  This does not mean that any password
matches, it means the user must connect without specifying a password.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX471"></A>
Non-blank <CODE>Password</CODE> values represent encrypted passwords.
MySQL does not store passwords in plaintext form for anyone to
see.  Rather, the password supplied by a user who is attempting to
connect is encrypted (using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function). The
encrypted password is then used when the client/server is checking if
the password is correct (This is done without the encrypted password
ever traveling over the connection.)  Note that from MySQL's
point of view the encrypted password is the REAL password, so you should
not give anyone access to it!  In particular, don't give normal users
read access to the tables in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database!

</P>
<P>
The examples below show how various combinations of <CODE>Host</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE> values in <CODE>user</CODE> table entries apply to incoming
connections:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Because you can use IP wild-card values in the <CODE>Host</CODE> field (for example,
<CODE>'144.155.166.%'</CODE> to match every host on a subnet), there is the
possibility that someone might try to exploit this capability by naming a
host <CODE>144.155.166.somewhere.com</CODE>.  To foil such attempts, MySQL
disallows matching on hostnames that start with digits and a dot. Thus, if
you have a host named something like <CODE>1.2.foo.com</CODE>, its name will never
match the <CODE>Host</CODE> column of the grant tables.  Only an IP number can
match an IP wild-card value.

</P>
<P>
An incoming connection may be matched by more than one entry in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table.  For example, a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>fred</CODE> would be matched by several of the entries just shown above.  How
does the server choose which entry to use if more than one matches?  The
server resolves this question by sorting the <CODE>user</CODE> table after reading
it at startup time, then looking through the entries in sorted order when a
user attempts to connect.  The first matching entry is the one that is used.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>user</CODE> table sorting works as follows.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table
looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| %         | root     | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
When the server reads in the table, it orders the entries with the
most-specific <CODE>Host</CODE> values first (<CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
means ``any host'' and is least specific).  Entries with the same <CODE>Host</CODE>
value are ordered with the most-specific <CODE>User</CODE> values first (a blank
<CODE>User</CODE> value means ``any user'' and is least specific).  The resulting
sorted <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| %         | root     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
<A NAME="IDX474"></A>
When a connection is attempted, the server looks through the sorted entries
and uses the first match found.  For a connection from <CODE>localhost</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE>, the entries with <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
match first.  Of those, the entry with the blank user name matches both the
connecting hostname and user name.  (The <CODE>'%'/'jeffrey'</CODE> entry would
have matched, too, but it is not the first match in the table.)

</P>
<P>
Here is another example.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

<P>
A connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the
first entry, whereas a connection from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the second.

</P>
<P>
A common misconception is to think that for a given user name, all entries
that explicitly name that user will be used first when the server attempts to
find a match for the connection.  This is simply not true.  The previous
example illustrates this, where a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is first matched not by the entry containing <CODE>'jeffrey'</CODE>
as the <CODE>User</CODE> field value, but by the entry with no user name!

</P>
<P>
If you have problems connecting to the server, print out the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and sort it by hand to see where the first match is being made.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Request_access" HREF="manual_toc.html#Request_access">4.2.9  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A></H3>

<P>
Once you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2.  For each request
that comes in on the connection, the server checks whether you have
sufficient privileges to perform it, based on the type of operation you wish
to perform.  This is where the privilege fields in the grant tables come into
play.  These privileges can come from any of the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, or <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables.  The grant
tables are manipulated with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  (You may find it helpful to refer to
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.5  How the Privilege System Works</A>, which lists the fields present in each of the grant
tables.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>user</CODE> table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global
basis and that apply no matter what the current database is.  For example, if
the <CODE>user</CODE> table grants you the <STRONG>delete</STRONG> privilege, you can
delete rows from any database on the server host!  In other words,
<CODE>user</CODE> table privileges are superuser privileges.  It is wise to grant
privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table only to superusers such as server or
database administrators.  For other users, you should leave the privileges
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table set to <CODE>'N'</CODE> and grant privileges on a
database-specific basis only, using the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.

A <CODE>'%'</CODE> or blank <CODE>Host</CODE> value in the <CODE>host</CODE> table means ``any

The <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables are read in and sorted when the server
starts up (at the same time that it reads the <CODE>user</CODE> table).  The
<CODE>db</CODE> table is sorted on the <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> scope
fields, and the <CODE>host</CODE> table is sorted on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE>
scope fields.  As with the <CODE>user</CODE> table, sorting puts the most-specific
values first and least-specific values last, and when the server looks for
matching entries, it uses the first match that it finds.

<A NAME="IDX482"></A>

The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables grant table- and

<P>
The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables are sorted on
the <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> fields.  This is similar to
<CODE>db</CODE> table sorting, although the sorting is simpler because
only the <CODE>Host</CODE> field may contain wild cards.

</P>
<P>
The request verification process is described below.  (If you are familiar
with the access-checking source code, you will notice that the description
here differs slightly from the algorithm used in the code.  The description
is equivalent to what the code actually does; it differs only to make the
explanation simpler.)

</P>
<P>
For administrative requests (<STRONG>shutdown</STRONG>, <STRONG>reload</STRONG>, etc.), the
server checks only the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry, because that is the only table
that specifies administrative privileges.  Access is granted if the entry
allows the requested operation and denied otherwise.  For example, if you
want to execute <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> but your <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
doesn't grant the <STRONG>shutdown</STRONG> privilege to you, access is denied
without even checking the <CODE>db</CODE> or <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  (They
contain no <CODE>Shutdown_priv</CODE> column, so there is no need to do so.)

</P>
<P>
For database-related requests (<STRONG>insert</STRONG>, <STRONG>update</STRONG>, etc.), the
server first checks the user's global (superuser) privileges by looking in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry.  If the entry allows the requested operation,
access is granted.  If the global privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table are
insufficient, the server determines the user's database-specific privileges
by checking the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The server looks in the <CODE>db</CODE> table for a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE>,
<CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> fields.  The <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> fields are
matched to the connecting user's hostname and MySQL user name.  The
<CODE>Db</CODE> field is matched to the database the user wants to access.  If
there is no entry for the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>, access is denied.

<LI>

If there is a matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry and its <CODE>Host</CODE> field is
not blank, that entry defines the user's database-specific privileges.

<LI>

If the matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry's <CODE>Host</CODE> field is blank, it
signifies that the <CODE>host</CODE> table enumerates which hosts should be allowed
access to the database.  In this case, a further lookup is done in the
<CODE>host</CODE> table to find a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields.
If no <CODE>host</CODE> table entry matches, access is denied.  If there is a
match, the user's database-specific privileges are computed as the
intersection (<EM>not</EM> the union!) of the privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> and
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries, that is, the privileges that are <CODE>'Y'</CODE> in both
entries.  (This way you can grant general privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry and then selectively restrict them on a host-by-host basis using the
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries.)
</OL>

<P>
After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the <CODE>db</CODE>
and <CODE>host</CODE> table entries, the server adds them to the global privileges
granted by the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  If the result allows the requested
operation, access is granted.  Otherwise, the server checks the user's
table and column privileges in the <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables and adds those to the user's privileges.  Access is allowed or denied
based on the result.

</P>
<P>
Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a user's
privileges are calculated may be summarized like this:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
It may not be apparent why, if the global <CODE>user</CODE> entry privileges are
initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the server
adds those privileges to the database-, table-, and column-specific privileges
later. The reason is that a request might require more than one type of
privilege.  For example, if you execute an <CODE>INSERT ...  SELECT</CODE>
statement, you need both <STRONG>insert</STRONG> and <STRONG>select</STRONG> privileges.
Your privileges might be such that the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry grants one
privilege and the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry grants the other.  In this case, you
have the necessary privileges to perform the request, but the server cannot
tell that from either table by itself; the privileges granted by the entries
in both tables must be combined.

The <CODE>host</CODE> table can be used to maintain a list of secure servers.

At TcX, the <CODE>host</CODE> table contains a list of all machines on the local

You can also use the <CODE>host</CODE> table to indicate hosts that are <EM>not</EM>
secure.  Suppose you have a machine <CODE>public.your.domain</CODE> that is located

entries
like this:

<H3><A NAME="Access_denied" HREF="manual_toc.html#Access_denied">4.2.10  Causes of <CODE>Access denied</CODE> Errors</A></H3>

<P>
If you encounter <CODE>Access denied</CODE> errors when you try to connect to the
MySQL server, the list below indicates some courses of
action you can take to correct the problem:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

After installing MySQL, did you run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
script to set up the initial grant table contents?  If not, do so.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.  Test the initial privileges by executing
this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root test
</PRE>

The server should let you connect without error.  You should also make sure
you have a file <TT>`user.MYD'</TT> in the MySQL database directory.
Ordinarily, this is <TT>`PATH/var/mysql/user.MYD'</TT>, where <CODE>PATH</CODE> is the
pathname to the MySQL installation root.

<LI>

After a fresh installation, you should connect to the server and set up
your users and their access permissions:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
</PRE>

The server should let you connect because the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user
has no password initially.  That is also a security risk, so setting the
<CODE>root</CODE> password is something you should do while you're setting up
your other MySQL users.

If you try to connect as <CODE>root</CODE> and get this error:


<PRE>
Access denied for user: '@unknown' to database mysql
</PRE>

this means that you don't have an entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a
<CODE>User</CODE> column value of <CODE>'root'</CODE> and that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> cannot
resolve the hostname for your client.  In this case, you must restart the
server with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option and edit your
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> or <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> file to add an entry for your
host.

<LI>

If you get an error like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

It means that you are using a wrong password. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.6  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

If you have forgot the root password, you can restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to change the password. You can find more
about this option later on in this manual section.

If you get the above error even if you haven't specified a password,
this means that you a wrong password in some <CODE>my.ini</CODE>
file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.  You can avoid using option files with the <CODE>--no-defaults</CODE> option, as follows:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root ver
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX490"></A>
If you updated an existing MySQL installation from a version earlier
than Version 3.22.11 to Version 3.22.11 or later, did you run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script?  If not, do so.  The structure of
the grant tables changed with MySQL Version 3.22.11 when the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement became functional.

<LI>

If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a session, it may be
that a superuser has changed them.  Reloading the grant tables affects new
client connections, but it also affects existing connections as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

<LI>

If you can't get your password to work, remember that you must use
the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function if you set the password with the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> statements.  The
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function is unnecessary if you specify the password using
the <CODE>GRANT ... INDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement or the <CODE>mysqladmin
password</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.6  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>localhost</CODE> is a synonym for your local hostname, and is also the
default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host
explicitly.  However, connections to <CODE>localhost</CODE> do not work if you are
running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads (<CODE>localhost</CODE> connections are
made using Unix sockets, which are not supported by MIT-pthreads).  To avoid
this problem on such systems, you should use the <CODE>--host</CODE> option to name
the server host explicitly.  This will make a TCP/IP connection to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  In this case, you must have your real hostname in
<CODE>user</CODE> table entries on the server host.  (This is true even if you are
running a client program on the same host as the server.)

<LI>

If you get an <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error when trying to connect to the
database with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE>, you may have a problem
with the <CODE>user</CODE> table. Check this by executing <CODE>mysql -u root
mysql</CODE> and issuing this SQL statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM user;
</PRE>

The result should include an entry with the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>
columns matching your computer's hostname and your MySQL user name.

<LI>

The <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error message will tell you who you are trying
to log in as, the host from which you are trying to connect, and whether
or not you were using a password. Normally, you should have one entry in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table that exactly matches the hostname and user name
that were given in the error message. For example if you get an error
message that contains <CODE>Using password: NO</CODE>, this means that you
tried to login without an password.

<LI>

If you get the following error when you try to connect from a different host
than the one on which the MySQL server is running, then there is no
row in the <CODE>user</CODE> table that matches that host:


<PRE>
Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
</PRE>

You can fix this by using the command-line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> (on the
server host!) to add a row to the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, or <CODE>host</CODE>
table for the user/hostname combination from which you are trying to
connect and then execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE>.  If you are
not running MySQL Version 3.22 and you don't know the IP number or
hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you should put an
entry with <CODE>'%'</CODE> as the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--log</CODE> option on the
server machine.  After trying to connect from the client machine, the
information in the MySQL log will indicate how you really did
connect.  (Then replace the <CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with the actual hostname that shows up in the log.  Otherwise, you'll
have a system that is insecure.)

Another reason for this error on Linux is that you are using a binary
MySQL version that is compiled with a different glibc version
than the one you are using.  In this case you should either upgrade your
OS/glibc or download the source MySQL version and compile this
yourself.  A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and install, so
this isn't a big problem.

<LI>

If you get an error message where the hostname is not shown or where the
hostname is an IP, even if you try to connect with a hostname:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some-hostname ver
Access denied for user: 'root' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

This means that MySQL got some error when trying to resolve the
IP to a hostname.  In this case you can execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE> to reset the internal DNS cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

Some permanent solutions are:


<UL>
<LI>

Try to find out what is wrong with your DNS server and fix this.

<LI>

Specify IPs instead of hostnames in the MySQL privilege tables.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>.

<LI>

Connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> if you are running the server and the client
on the same machine.

<LI>

Put the client machine names in <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u root test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -h your_hostname -u root
test</CODE> results in <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, then you may not have the correct name
for your host in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  A common problem here is that the
<CODE>Host</CODE> value in the user table entry specifies an unqualified hostname,
but your system's name resolution routines return a fully qualified domain
name (or vice-versa).  For example, if you have an entry with host
<CODE>'tcx'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, but your DNS tells MySQL that
your hostname is <CODE>'tcx.subnet.se'</CODE>, the entry will not work. Try adding
an entry to the <CODE>user</CODE> table that contains the IP number of your host as
the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value.  (Alternatively, you could add an entry to the
<CODE>user</CODE> table with a <CODE>Host</CODE> value that contains a wild card--for
example, <CODE>'tcx.%'</CODE>.  However, use of hostnames ending with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is
<EM>insecure</EM> and is <EM>not</EM> recommended!)

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -u user_name
other_db_name</CODE> doesn't work, you don't have an entry for <CODE>other_db_name</CODE>
listed in the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> works when executed on the server
machine, but <CODE>mysql -u host_name -u user_name db_name</CODE> doesn't work when
executed on another client machine, you don't have the client machine listed
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table or the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If you can't figure out why you get <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, remove from the
<CODE>user</CODE> table all entries that have <CODE>Host</CODE> values containing
wild cards (entries that contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>).  A very common error
is to insert a new entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'%'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some user'</CODE>, thinking that this will allow you to specify
<CODE>localhost</CODE> to connect from the same machine.  The reason that this
doesn't work is that the default privileges include an entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.  Because that entry
has a <CODE>Host</CODE> value <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> that is more specific than
<CODE>'%'</CODE>, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from
<CODE>localhost</CODE>!  The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some_user'</CODE>, or to
remove the entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.

<LI>

If you get the following error, you may have a problem with the <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table:


<PRE>
Access to database denied
</PRE>

If the entry selected from the <CODE>db</CODE> table has an empty value in the
<CODE>Host</CODE> column, make sure there are one or more corresponding entries in
the <CODE>host</CODE> table specifying which hosts the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry
applies to.

If you get the error when using the SQL commands <CODE>SELECT ...
INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, your entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
probably doesn't have the <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege enabled.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
Remember that client programs will use connection parameters specified
in configuration files or environment variables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.  If a client seems to be sending the wrong default
connection parameters when you don't specify them on the command line,
check your environment and the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your home
directory.  You might also check the system-wide MySQL
configuration files, though it is far less likely that client connection
parameters will be specified there. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.  If you get
<CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you run a client without any options, make
sure you haven't specified an old password in any of your option files!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.

<LI>

If you make changes to the grant tables directly (using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement) and your changes seem to be ignored, remember
that you must issue a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or execute a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> command to cause the server to re-read
the privilege tables.  Otherwise your changes have no effect until the
next time the server is restarted.  Remember that after you set the
<CODE>root</CODE> password with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> command, you won't need to
specify it until after you flush the privileges, because the server
won't know you've changed the password yet!

<LI>

If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC program, try to
connect to the server with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> or <CODE>mysql
-u user_name -pyour_pass db_name</CODE>.  If you are able to connect using the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client, there is a problem with your program and not with the
access privileges.  (Note that there is no space between <CODE>-p</CODE> and the
password; you can also use the <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> syntax to specify
the password. If you use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option alone, MySQL will 
prompt you for the password.)

<LI>

For testing, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with the
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  Then you can change the MySQL
grant tables and use the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script to check whether or not
your modifications have the desired effect.  When you are satisfied with your
changes, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server to start using the new grant tables.  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Reloading the
grant tables overrides the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  This allows
you to tell the server to begin using the grant tables again without bringing
it down and restarting it.

<LI>

If everything else fails, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with a debugging
option (for example, <CODE>--debug=d,general,query</CODE>). This will print host and
user information about attempted connections, as well as information about
each command issued. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

<LI>

If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide a
dump of the MySQL grant tables. You can dump the tables with
the <CODE>mysqldump mysql</CODE> command. As always, post your problem using
the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.  In some cases you may need
to restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to run

<CODE>GRANT</CODE> is implemented in MySQL Version 3.22.11 or later. For
earlier MySQL versions, the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement does nothing.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands allow system administrators
to create users and grant and revoke rights to MySQL users at
four privilege levels:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Global level</STRONG>
<DD>
Global privileges apply to all databases on a given server. These privileges
are stored in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.

<DT><STRONG>Database level</STRONG>
<DD>
Database privileges apply to all tables in a given database. These privileges
are stored in the <CODE>mysql.db</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.host</CODE> tables.

<DT><STRONG>Table level</STRONG>
<DD>
Table privileges apply to all columns in a given table. These privileges are
stored in the <CODE>mysql.tables_priv</CODE> table.

<DT><STRONG>Column level</STRONG>
<DD>
Column privileges apply to single columns in a given table. These privileges are
stored in the <CODE>mysql.columns_priv</CODE> table.
</DL>

<P>
If you give a grant for a users that doesn't exists, that user is created.
For examples of how <CODE>GRANT</CODE> works, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_users">4.3.5  Adding New Users to MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
For the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> statements, <CODE>priv_type</CODE> may be
specified as any of the following:

</P>

<PRE>
ALL PRIVILEGES      FILE                RELOAD
ALTER               INDEX               SELECT
CREATE              INSERT              SHUTDOWN
DELETE              PROCESS             UPDATE
DROP                REFERENCES          USAGE
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ALL</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>ALL PRIVILEGES</CODE>.  <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> is not
yet implemented.  <CODE>USAGE</CODE> is currently a synonym for ``no privileges.''
It can be used when you want to create a user that has no privileges.

</P>
<P>
To revoke the <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege from a user, use a <CODE>priv_type</CODE>
value of <CODE>GRANT OPTION</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON ... FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a table are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>,
<CODE>GRANT</CODE>, <CODE>INDEX</CODE>, and <CODE>ALTER</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a column (that is, when
you use a <CODE>column_list</CODE> clause) are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can set global privileges by using <CODE>ON *.*</CODE> syntax.  You can set
database privileges by using <CODE>ON db_name.*</CODE> syntax. If you specify
<CODE>ON *</CODE> and you have a current database, you will set the privileges for
that database.  (<STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> If you specify <CODE>ON *</CODE> and you
<EM>don't</EM> have a current database, you will affect the global privileges!)

</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate granting rights to users from arbitrary hosts,
MySQL supports specifying the <CODE>user_name</CODE> value in the form
<CODE>user@host</CODE>.  If you want to specify a <CODE>user</CODE> string
containing special characters (such as <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>), or a <CODE>host</CODE> string
containing special characters or wild-card characters (such as <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>), you
can quote the user or host name (for example, <CODE>'test-user'@'test-hostname'</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You can specify wild cards in the hostname.  For example,
<CODE>user@"%.loc.gov"</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE> for any host in the
<CODE>loc.gov</CODE> domain, and <CODE>user@"144.155.166.%"</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE>
for any host in the <CODE>144.155.166</CODE> class C subnet.

</P>
<P>
The simple form <CODE>user</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>user@"%"</CODE>.
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> If you allow anonymous users to connect to the MySQL
server (which is the default), you should also add all local users as
<CODE>user@localhost</CODE> because otherwise the anonymous user entry for the
local host in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table will be used when the user tries to
log into the MySQL server from the local machine!  Anonymous users
are defined by inserting entries with <CODE>User=''</CODE> into the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table. You can verify if this applies to you by executing
this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT Host,User FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
</PRE>

<P>
For the moment, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> only supports host, table, database, and
column names up to 60 characters long. A user name can be up to 16
characters.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a table or column are formed from the
logical OR of the privileges at each of the four privilege
levels.  For example, if the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table specifies that a
user has a global <STRONG>select</STRONG> privilege, this can't be denied by an
entry at the database, table, or column level.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a column can be calculated as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
In most cases, you grant rights to a user at only one of the privilege
levels, so life isn't normally as complicated as above. The details of the
privilege-checking procedure are presented in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a user/hostname combination that does not exist
in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table, an entry is added and remains there until
deleted with a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command.  In other words, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> may
create <CODE>user</CODE> table entries, but <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> will not remove them;
you must do that explicitly using <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
In MySQL Version 3.22.12 or later,
if a new user is created or if you have global grant privileges, the user's
password will be set to the password specified by the <CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE>
clause, if one is given.  If the user already had a password, it is replaced
by the new one.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> If you create a new user but do not specify an
<CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> clause, the user has no password.  This is insecure.

</P>
<P>
Passwords can also be set with the <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a database, an entry in the <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
table is created if needed. When all privileges for the database have been
removed with <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, this entry is deleted.

</P>
<P>
If a user doesn't have any privileges on a table, the table is not displayed
when the user requests a list of tables (for example, with a <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE>
statement).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE> clause gives the user the ability to give
to other users any privileges the user has at the specified privilege level.
You should be careful to whom you give the <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege, as two
users with different privileges may be able to join privileges!

</P>
<P>
You cannot grant another user a privilege you don't have yourself;
the <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege allows you to give away only those privileges
you possess.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that when you grant a user the <STRONG>grant</STRONG> privilege at a
particular privilege level, any privileges the user already possesses (or
is given in the future!) at that level are also grantable by that user.
Suppose you grant a user the <STRONG>insert</STRONG> privilege on a database.  If
you then grant the <STRONG>select</STRONG> privilege on the database and specify
<CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE>, the user can give away not only the <STRONG>select</STRONG>
privilege, but also <STRONG>insert</STRONG>.  If you then grant the <STRONG>update</STRONG>
privilege to the user on the database, the user can give away the
<STRONG>insert</STRONG>, <STRONG>select</STRONG> and <STRONG>update</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
You should not grant <STRONG>alter</STRONG> privileges to a normal user.  If you
do that, the user can try to subvert the privilege system by renaming
tables!

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using table or column privileges for even one user, the
server examines table and column privileges for all users and this will slow
down MySQL a bit.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all privileges are read into memory.
Database, table, and column privileges take effect at once, and
user-level privileges take effect the next time the user connects.
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> or
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the server to reload the grant
tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
The biggest differences between the ANSI SQL and MySQL versions of
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In MySQL privileges are given for an username + hostname combination
and not only for an username.

<LI>

ANSI SQL doesn't have global or database-level privileges, and ANSI SQL
doesn't support all privilege types that MySQL supports.
MySQL doesn't support the ANSI SQL <CODE>TRIGGER</CODE>, <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE> or
<CODE>UNDER</CODE> privileges.

<LI>

ANSI SQL privileges are structured in a hierarchal manner. If you remove
an user, all privileges the user has granted are revoked. In
MySQL the granted privileges are not automatically revoked, but
you have to revoke these yourself if needed.

<LI>

If you in MySQL have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> grant on only part of the
columns in a table, you can execute <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements on the
table; The columns for which you don't have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege
will set to their default values. ANSI SQL requires you to have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on all columns.

<LI>

When you drop a table in ANSI SQL, all privileges for the table are revoked.
If you revoke a privilege in ANSI SQL, all privileges that were granted based
on this privilege are also revoked. In MySQL, privileges can be
dropped only with explicit <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands or by manipulating the
MySQL grant tables.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="User_names" HREF="manual_toc.html#User_names">4.3.2  MySQL User Names and Passwords</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are several distinctions between the way user names and passwords are
used by MySQL and the way they are used by Unix or Windows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have
nothing to do with Unix user names (login names) or Windows user names.  Most
MySQL clients by default try to log in using the current Unix user
name as the MySQL user name, but that is for convenience only.
Client programs allow a different name to be specified with the <CODE>-u</CODE> or
<CODE>--user</CODE> options. This means that you can't make a database secure in
any way unless all MySQL user names have passwords.  Anyone may
attempt to connect to the server using any name, and they will succeed if
they specify any name that doesn't have a password.

<LI>

MySQL user names can be up to 16 characters long; Unix user names
typically are limited to 8 characters.

<LI>

MySQL passwords have nothing to do with Unix passwords.  There is no
necessary connection between the password you use to log in to a Unix machine
and the password you use to access a database on that machine.

<LI>

MySQL encrypts passwords using a different algorithm than the
one used during the Unix login process.  See the descriptions of the
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> and <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> functions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.5.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.  Note that even if the password is stored 'scrambled', and
knowing your 'scrambled' password is enough to be able to connect to
the MySQL server!
</UL>

<P>
MySQL users and their privileges are normally created with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you login to a MySQL server with a command line client you
should specify the password with <CODE>--password=your-password</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Connecting">4.2.7  Connecting to the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password=guess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want the client to prompt for a password, you should use
<CODE>--password</CODE> without any argument

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password database_name
</PRE>

<P>
or the short form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -p database_name
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in the last example the password is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> 'database_name'.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option to supply a password you should do so
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -pguess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
On some systems, the library call that MySQL uses to prompt for a
password will automatically cut the password to 8 characters. Internally
MySQL doesn't have any limit for the length of the password.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privilege_changes" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A></H3>

<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all grant table contents are read into memory and
become effective at that point.

</P>
<P>
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE>,
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.

</P>
<P>
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE> to tell the
server to reload the grant tables.  Otherwise your changes will have <EM>no
effect</EM> until you restart the server. If you change the grant tables manually
but forget to reload the privileges, you will be wondering why your changes
don't seem to make any difference!

</P>
<P>
When the server notices that the grant tables have been changed,
existing client connections are affected as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's next
request.

<LI>

Database privilege changes take effect at the next <CODE>USE db_name</CODE>
command.
</UL>

<P>
Global privilege changes and password changes take effect the next time the
client connects.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Default_privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
<A NAME="IDX506"></A>
<A NAME="IDX507"></A>
<A NAME="IDX508"></A>
<A NAME="IDX509"></A>
<A NAME="IDX510"></A>
<A NAME="IDX511"></A>

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL, you set up the initial access privileges by
running <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Quick_install">2.3.1  Quick Installation Overview</A>.
The <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script starts up the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, then initializes the grant tables to contain the following set
of privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user is created as a superuser who can do
anything.  Connections must be made from the local host.

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
The initial <CODE>root</CODE> password is empty, so anyone can connect as <CODE>root</CODE>
<EM>without a password</EM> and be granted all privileges.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
An anonymous user is created that can do anything with databases that have a
name of <CODE>'test'</CODE> or starting with <CODE>'test_'</CODE>.  Connections must be
made from the local host.  This means any local user can connect without a
password and be treated as the anonymous user.

<LI>

Other privileges are denied.  For example, normal users can't use
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The default privileges are different for Windows.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_running">2.6.2.3  Running MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Because your installation is initially wide open, one of the first things you
should do is specify a password for the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user.  You can do this as follows (note that you specify the
password using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
           WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
You can, in MySQL Version 3.22 and above, use the <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE>
statement:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR root=PASSWORD('new_password');
</PRE>

<P>
Another way to set the password is by using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root password new_password
</PRE>

<P>
Only users with write/update access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can change the
password for others users.  All normal users (not anonymous ones) can only
change their own password with either of the above commands or with
<CODE>SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new password')</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you update the password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table directly using
the first method, you must tell the server to re-read the grant tables (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>), because the change will go unnoticed otherwise.

</P>
<P>
Once the <CODE>root</CODE> password has been set, thereafter you must supply that
password when you connect to the server as <CODE>root</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You may wish to leave the <CODE>root</CODE> password blank so that you don't need
to specify it while you perform additional setup or testing. However, be sure
to set it before using your installation for any real production work.

</P>
<P>
See the <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE> script to see how it sets up
the default privileges.  You can use this as a basis to see how to
add other users.

</P>
<P>
If you want the initial privileges to be different than those just described
above, you can modify <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before you run it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
<A NAME="IDX514"></A>
To re-create the grant tables completely, remove all the <TT>`.frm'</TT>,
<TT>`.MYI'</TT>, and <TT>`.MYD'</TT> files in the directory containing the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  (This is the directory named <TT>`mysql'</TT> under
the database directory, which is listed when you run <CODE>mysqld
--help</CODE>.) Then run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script, possibly after
editing it first to have the privileges you want.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> For MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
you should NOT delete the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files.  If you accidentally do this,
you should copy them back from your MySQL distribution before
running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX517"></A>

<A NAME="IDX519"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can add users two different ways: by using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements
or by manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly.  The
preferred method is to use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, because they are
more concise and less error-prone. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
There is also a lot of contributed programs like <CODE>phpmyadmin</CODE> that
can be used to create and administrate users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Contrib">D  Contributed Programs</A>.

</P>
<P>
The examples below show how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to set up new
users.  These examples assume that privileges are set up according to the
defaults described in the previous section.  This means that to make changes,
you must be on the same machine where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must
connect as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user, and the <CODE>root</CODE> user must
have the <STRONG>insert</STRONG> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database and the
<STRONG>reload</STRONG> administrative privilege.  Also, if you have changed the
<CODE>root</CODE> user password, you must specify it for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> commands
below.

</P>
<P>
You can add new users by issuing <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@localhost
           IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@"%"
           IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO admin@localhost;
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO dummy@localhost;
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements set up three new users:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>monty</CODE>
<DD>
A full superuser who can connect to the server from anywhere, but who must
use a password <CODE>'some_pass'</CODE> to do so.  Note that we must issue
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements for both <CODE>monty@localhost</CODE> and
<CODE>monty@"%"</CODE>.  If we don't add the entry with <CODE>localhost</CODE>, the
anonymous user entry for <CODE>localhost</CODE> that is created by
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> will take precedence when we connect from the local
host, because it has a more specific <CODE>Host</CODE> field value and thus comes
earlier in the <CODE>user</CODE> table sort order.

<DT><CODE>admin</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect from <CODE>localhost</CODE> without a password and who is
granted the <STRONG>reload</STRONG> and <STRONG>process</STRONG> administrative privileges.
This allows the user to execute the <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqladmin flush-*</CODE> commands, as well as
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> .  No database-related privileges are granted.
(They can be granted later by issuing additional <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements.)

<DT><CODE>dummy</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect without a password, but only from the local host.  The
global privileges are all set to <CODE>'N'</CODE> -- the <CODE>USAGE</CODE> privilege
type allows you to create a user with no privileges.  It is assumed that you
will grant database-specific privileges later.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
You can also add the same user access information directly by issuing
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements and then telling the server to reload the grant
tables:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('localhost','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
                'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('%','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
                'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user SET Host='localhost',User='admin',
                 Reload_priv='Y', Process_priv='Y';
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
                        VALUES('localhost','dummy','');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
Depending on your MySQL version, you may have to use a different
number of <CODE>'Y'</CODE> values above (versions prior to Version 3.22.11 had fewer
privilege columns).  For the <CODE>admin</CODE> user, the more readable extended
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax that is available starting with Version 3.22.11 is used.

</P>
<P>
Note that to set up a superuser, you need only create a <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry with the privilege fields set to <CODE>'Y'</CODE>.  No <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries are necessary.

</P>
<P>
The privilege columns in the <CODE>user</CODE> table were not set explicitly in the
last <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (for the <CODE>dummy</CODE> user), so those columns
are assigned the default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>.  This is the same thing that
<CODE>GRANT USAGE</CODE> does.

</P>
<P>
The following example adds a user <CODE>custom</CODE> who can connect from hosts
<CODE>localhost</CODE>, <CODE>server.domain</CODE>, and <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>.  He wants
to access the <CODE>bankaccount</CODE> database only from <CODE>localhost</CODE>,
the <CODE>expenses</CODE> database only from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>, and
the <CODE>customer</CODE> database from all three hosts.  He wants
to use the password <CODE>stupid</CODE> from all three hosts.

</P>
<P>
To set up this user's privileges using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, run these
commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
           ON bankaccount.*
           TO custom@localhost
           IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
           ON expenses.*
           TO custom@whitehouse.gov
           IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
           ON customer.*
           TO custom@'%'
           IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
</PRE>

<P>
The reason that we do to grant statements for the user 'custom' is that
we want the give the user access to MySQL both from the local
machine with Unix sockets and from the remote machine 'whitehouse.gov'
over TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
To set up the user's privileges by modifying the grant tables directly,
run these commands (note the <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> at the end):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
       VALUES('localhost','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
       VALUES('server.domain','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
       VALUES('whitehouse.gov','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
       (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
        Create_priv,Drop_priv)
       VALUES
       ('localhost','bankaccount','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
       (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
        Create_priv,Drop_priv)
       VALUES
       ('whitehouse.gov','expenses','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
       (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
        Create_priv,Drop_priv)
       VALUES('%','customer','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
The first three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add <CODE>user</CODE> table entries that
allow user <CODE>custom</CODE> to connect from the various hosts with the given
password, but grant no permissions to him (all privileges are set to the
default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>).  The next three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add
<CODE>db</CODE> table entries that grant privileges to <CODE>custom</CODE> for the
<CODE>bankaccount</CODE>, <CODE>expenses</CODE>, and <CODE>customer</CODE> databases, but only
when accessed from the proper hosts.  As usual, when the grant tables are
modified directly, the server must be told to reload them (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>) so that the privilege changes take effect.

</P>
<P>
If you want to give a specific user access from any machine in a given
domain, you can issue a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ...
           ON *.*
           TO myusername@"%.mydomainname.com"
           IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
</PRE>

<P>
To do the same thing by modifying the grant tables directly, do this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES ('%.mydomainname.com', 'myusername',
           PASSWORD('mypassword'),...);
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use <CODE>xmysqladmin</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_webadmin</CODE>, and even
<CODE>xmysql</CODE> to insert, change, and update values in the grant tables.
You can find these utilities in the
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/">Contrib directory of the MySQL
Website</a>.

In most cases you should use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> to set up your users/passwords,
so the following only applies for advanced users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The examples in the preceding sections illustrate an important principle:
when you store a non-empty password using <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements, you must use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function to encrypt it.  This
is because the <CODE>user</CODE> table stores passwords in encrypted form, not as
plaintext.  If you forget that fact, you are likely to attempt to set
passwords like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
       VALUES('%','jeffrey','biscuit');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is that the plaintext value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> is stored as the
password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  When the user <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> attempts to
connect to the server using this password, the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client encrypts
it with <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, generates an authentification vector
based on <STRONG>encrypted</STRONG> password and a random number,
obtained from server, and sends the result to the server.
The server uses the <CODE>password</CODE> value in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
(that is <STRONG>not encrypted</STRONG> value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE>)
to perform the same calculations, and compares results.
The comparison fails and the server rejects the
connection:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u jeffrey -pbiscuit test
Access denied
</PRE>

<P>
Passwords must be encrypted when they are inserted in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, so the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement should have been specified like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
       VALUES('%','jeffrey',PASSWORD('biscuit'));
</PRE>

<P>
You must also use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function when you use <CODE>SET
PASSWORD</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR jeffrey@"%" = PASSWORD('biscuit');
</PRE>

<P>
If you set passwords using the <CODE>GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement
or the <CODE>mysqladmin password</CODE> command, the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function
is unnecessary.  They both take care of encrypting the password for you,
so you would specify a password of <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO jeffrey@"%" IDENTIFIED BY 'biscuit';
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u jeffrey password biscuit
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> does not perform password encryption in the
same way that Unix passwords are encrypted.  You should not assume that if
your Unix password and your MySQL password are the same, that
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> will result in the same encrypted value as is stored in the
Unix password file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#User_names">4.3.2  MySQL User Names and Passwords</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Password_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Password_security">4.3.7  Keeping Your Password Secure</A></H3>

<P>
It is inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it to
discovery by other users.  The methods you can use to specify your password
when you run client programs are listed below, along with an assessment of
the risks of each method:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Never give a normal user access to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table. Knowing
the encrypted password for a user makes it possible to login as this
user.  The passwords are only scrambled so that one shouldn't be able to
see the real password you used (if you happen to use a similar password
with your other applications).

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-pyour_pass</CODE> or <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> option on the command
line.  This is convenient but insecure, because your password becomes visible
to system status programs (such as <CODE>ps</CODE>) that may be invoked by other
users to display command lines.  (MySQL clients typically overwrite
the command-line argument with zeroes during their initialization sequence,
but there is still a brief interval during which the value is visible.)

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password</CODE> option (with no <CODE>your_pass</CODE> value
specified).  In this case, the client program solicits the password from
the terminal:
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u user_name -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> characters represent your password.

It is more secure to enter your password this way than to specify it on the
command line because it is not visible to other users.  However, this method
of entering a password is suitable only for programs that you run
interactively.  If you want to invoke a client from a script that runs
non-interactively, there is no opportunity to enter the password from the
terminal. On some systems, you may even find that the first line of your
script is read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your password!

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
Store your password in a configuration file.  For example, you can list your
password in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your
home directory:


<PRE>
[client]
password=your_pass
</PRE>

If you store your password in <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>, the file should not be group or
world readable or writable.  Make sure the file's access mode is <CODE>400</CODE>
or <CODE>600</CODE>.

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.
<LI>

You can store your password in the <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> environment variable, but
this method must be considered extremely insecure and should not be used.
Some versions of <CODE>ps</CODE> include an option to display the environment of
running processes; your password will be in plain sight for all to see if
you set <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>.  Even on systems without such a version of
<CODE>ps</CODE>, it is unwise to assume there is no other method to observe process
environments. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.
</UL>

<P>
All in all, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the
password or to specify the password in a properly protected <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>
file.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL tables are stored as files, it is easy to do a
backup. To get a consistent backup, do a <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> on the
relevant tables followed by <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> for the tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.2  <CODE>LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You only need a read lock; this allows other threads to continue to
query the tables while you are making a copy of the files in the
database directory.  The <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> is needed to ensure that
the all active index pages is written to disk before you start the backup.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make a SQL level backup of a table, you can use
<CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BACKUP_TABLE">4.4.2  <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another way to back up a database is to use the <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> program or
the <CODE>mysqlhotcopy script</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.5  mysqldump, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlhotcopy">4.8.6  mysqlhotcopy, Copying MySQL Databases and Tables</A>.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Do a full backup of your databases:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqldump --tab=/path/to/some/dir --opt --full

or

shell&#62; mysqlhotcopy database /path/to/some/dir
</PRE>

You can also simply copy all table files (<TT>`*.frm'</TT>, <TT>`*.MYD'</TT>, and
<TT>`*.MYI'</TT> files) as long as the server isn't updating anything.
The script <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> does use this method.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
Stop <CODE>mysqld</CODE> if it's running, then start it with the
<CODE>--log-update[=file_name]</CODE> option.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>. The update
log file(s) provide you with the information you need to replicate
changes to the database that are made subsequent to the point at which
you executed <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
If you have to restore something, try to recover your tables using
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> first.  That should work in
99.9% of all cases.  If <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> fails, try the following
procedure: (This will only work if you have started MySQL with
<CODE>--log-update</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>.):

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Restore the original <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> backup.
<LI>

Execute the following command to re-run the updates in the binary log:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql
</PRE>

If you are using the update log you can use:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ls -1 -t -r hostname.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
<CODE>ls</CODE> is used to get all the update log files in the right order.

</P>
<P>
You can also do selective backups with <CODE>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
FROM tbl_name</CODE> and restore with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' REPLACE
...</CODE> To avoid duplicate records, you need a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> or a
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key in the table. The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> keyword causes old records
to be replaced with new ones when a new record duplicates an old record on
a unique key value.

</P>
<P>
If you get performance problems in making backups on your system, you can
solve this by setting up replication and do the backups on the slave
instead of on the master. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A>.

</P>

If you are using a Veritas file system, you can do:

tables. For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, copies <CODE>.frm</CODE> (definition)  and
<CODE>.MYD</CODE> (data) files. The index file can be rebuilt from those two.

</P>
<P>
Before using this command, please see See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>
<P>
During the backup, read lock will be held for each table, one at time,
as they are being backed up. If you want to backup several tables as
a snapshot, you must first issue <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> obtaining a read
lock for each table in the group.

For dynamic sized <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables a started check will always

</P>
<P>
You can combine check options as in:

</P>

<PRE>
CHECK TABLE test_table FAST QUICK;
</PRE>

<P>
Which only would do a quick check on the table if it wasn't closed properly.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> that in some case <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will change the
table!  This happens if the table is marked as 'corrupted' or 'not
closed properly' but <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> didn't find any problems in the
table.  In this case <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will mark the table as ok.

</P>
<P>
If a table is corrupted, then it's most likely that the problem is in
the indexes and not in the data part.  All of the above check types
checks the indexes throughly and should thus find most errors.

</P>
<P>
If you just want to check a table that you assume is ok, you should use
no check options or the <CODE>QUICK</CODE> option. The later should be used
when you are in a hurry and can take the very small risk that
<CODE>QUICK</CODE> didn't find an error in the data file (In most cases
MySQL should find, under normal usage, any error in the data
file. If this happens then the table will be marked as 'corrupted',
in which case the table can't be used until it's repaired).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FAST</CODE> and <CODE>CHANGED</CODE> are mostly intended to be used from a
script (for example to be executed from cron) if you want to check your
table from time to time. In most cases you <CODE>FAST</CODE> is to be prefered
over <CODE>CHANGED</CODE>.  (The only case when it isn't is when you suspect a
bug you have found a bug in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> code.).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> is only to be used after you have run a normal check but
still get strange errors from a table when MySQL tries to
update a row or find a row by key (this is VERY unlikely to happen if a
normal check has succeeded!).

</P>
<P>
Some things reported by check table, can't be corrected automatically:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>Found row where the auto_increment column has the value 0</CODE>.

This means that you have in the table a row where the
<CODE>auto_increment</CODE> index column contains the value 0.
(It's possible to create a row where the auto_increment column is 0 by
explicitely setting the column to 0 with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement)

This isn't an error in itself, but could cause trouble if you decide to
dump the table and restore it or do an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the
table. In this case the auto_increment column will change value,
according to the rules of auto_increment columns, which could cause
problems like a duplicate key error.

To get rid of the warning, just execute an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
to set the column to some other value than 0.

<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> repairs a possible corrupted table. The command returns a
table with the following columns:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Value</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Msg_text </TD><TD> The message.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Note that you can get many rows of information for each repaired
table. The last one row will be of <CODE>Msg_type status</CODE> and should
normally be <CODE>OK</CODE>.  If you don't get <CODE>OK</CODE>, you should try
repairing the table with <CODE>myisamchk -o</CODE>, as <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>
does not yet implement all the options of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. In the near
future, we will make it more flexible.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>QUICK</CODE> is given then MySQL will try to do a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> of only the index tree.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> then MySQL will create the index row
by row instead of creating one index at a time with sorting;  This may be
better than sorting on fixed-length keys if you have long <CODE>char()</CODE>
keys that compress very good.

<H3><A NAME="Table_maintenance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
To check/repair MyISAM tables (<CODE>.MYI</CODE> and <CODE>.MYD</CODE>) you should
use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility. To check/repair ISAM tables
(<CODE>.ISM</CODE> and <CODE>.ISD</CODE>) you should use the <CODE>isamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the following text we will talk about <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but everything
also applies to the old <CODE>isamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility to get information about your
database tables, check and repair them, or optimize them.  The following
sections describe how to invoke <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (including a
description of its options), how to set up a table maintenance schedule,
and how to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to perform its various functions.

</P>
<P>
You can, in most cases, also use the command <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLES</CODE> to
optimize and repair tables, but this is not as fast or reliable (in case
of real fatal errors) as <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  On the other hand,
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier to use and you don't have to worry about
flushing tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Even that the repair in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is quite secure, it's always a
good idea to make a backup BEFORE doing a repair (or anything that could
make a lot of changes to a table)

</P>



<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_syntax" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A></H4>

<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk [options] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>options</CODE> specify what you want <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to do.  They are
described below.  (You can also get a list of options by invoking
<CODE>myisamchk --help</CODE>.)  With no options, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> simply checks your
table.  To get more information or to tell <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to take corrective
action, specify options as described below and in the following sections.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the database table you want to check/repair.  If you run
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> somewhere other than in the database directory, you must
specify the path to the file, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> has no idea where your
database is located.  Actually, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> doesn't care whether or not
the files you are working on are located in a database directory; you can
copy the files that correspond to a database table into another location and
perform recovery operations on them there.

</P>
<P>
You can name several tables on the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command line if you
wish.  You can also specify a name as an index file
name (with the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> suffix), which allows you to specify all
tables in a directory by using the pattern <TT>`*.MYI'</TT>.
For example, if you are in a database directory, you can check all the
tables in the directory like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk *.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables there
by specifying the path to the directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wild card
with the path to the MySQL data directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
The recommended way to quickly check all tables is:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to check all tables and repair all tables that are corrupted,
you can use the following line:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent --force -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
The above assumes that you have more than 64 M free.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you get an error like:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk: warning: 1 clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by
the another program (like the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) that hasn't yet closed
the file or that has died without closing the file properly.

</P>
<P>
If you <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must force a sync/close of all
tables with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and ensure that no one is using the
tables while you are running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In MySQL Version 3.23
the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
instead of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check tables.

</P>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> supports the following options.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-# or --debug=debug_options</CODE>

Output debug log. The <CODE>debug_options</CODE> string often is
<CODE>'d:t:o,filename'</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-? or --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>-O var=option, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables and their default values
for myisamchk can be examined with <CODE>myisamchk --help</CODE>:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>key_buffer_size </TD><TD> 523264
</TD></TR>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>sort_key_blocks </TD><TD> 16
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>decode_bits </TD><TD> 9
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> is used when the keys are repaired by sorting
keys, which is the normal case when you use <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is used when you are checking the table with
<CODE>--extended-check</CODE> or when the keys are repaired by inserting key
row by row in to the table (like when doing normal inserts). Repairing
through the key buffer is used in the following cases:


<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

If you are using a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index.
<LI>

If the temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice
as big as when creating the key file directly.  This is often the case
when you have big <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> keys as the
sort needs to store the whole keys during sorting. If you have lots
of temporary space and you can force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair by sorting
you can use the <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE> option.
</UL>

Reparing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using
sorting, but is also much slower.

If you want a faster repair, set the above variables to about 1/4 of your
available memory.  You can set both variables to big values, as only one
of the above buffers will be used at a time.

<DT><CODE>-s or --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur. You can use <CODE>-s</CODE>
twice (<CODE>-ss</CODE>) to make <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> very silent.
<DT><CODE>-v or --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print more information. This can be used with <CODE>-d</CODE> and
<CODE>-e</CODE>. Use <CODE>-v</CODE> multiple times (<CODE>-vv</CODE>, <CODE>-vvv</CODE>) for more
verbosity!
<DT><CODE>-V or --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> version and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w or, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of giving an error if the table is locked, wait until the table
is unlocked before continuing.  Note that if you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
on the table with <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>, the table can only be locked
by another <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c or --check</CODE>
<DD>
Check table for errors. This is the default operation if you are not
giving <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> any options that override this.

<DT><CODE>-e or --extend-check</CODE>
<DD>
Check the table VERY thoroughly (which is quite slow if you have many
indexes).  This option should only be used in extreme cases.  Normally,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk --medium-check</CODE> should, in most
cases, be able to find out if there are any errors in the table.

If you are using <CODE>--extended-check</CODE> and have much memory, you should
increase the value of <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> a lot!

<DT><CODE>-F or --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.
<DT><CODE>-C or --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since the last check.
<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>
Restart <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> with <CODE>-r</CODE> (repair) on the table, if
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> finds any errors in the table.
<DT><CODE>-i or --information</CODE>
<DD>
Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.
<DT><CODE>-m or --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99% of all errors.
Should, however, be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-U or --update-state</CODE>
<DD>
Store in the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file when the table was checked and if the table crashed.  This should be used to get full benefit of the
<CODE>--check-only-changed</CODE> option, but you shouldn't use this
option if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is using the table and you are
running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-T or --read-only</CODE>
<DD>
Don't mark table as checked. This is useful if you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
to check a table that is in use by some other application that doesn't
use locking (like <CODE>mysqld --skip-locking</CODE>).

<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_repair_options" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_repair_options">4.4.6.4  Repair Options for myisamchk</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following options are used if you start <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> with
<CODE>-r</CODE> or <CODE>-o</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-D # or --data-file-length=#</CODE>
<DD>
Max length of data file (when re-creating data file when it's 'full').
<DT><CODE>-e or --extend-check</CODE>
<DD>
Try to recover every possible row from the data file.
Normally this will also find a lot of garbage rows. Don't use this option
if you are not totally desperate.
<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite old temporary files (<CODE>table_name.TMD</CODE>) instead of aborting.
<DT><CODE>-k # or keys-used=#</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using ISAM, tells the ISAM table handler to update only the
first <CODE>#</CODE> indexes.  If you are using <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, tells which keys
to use, where each binary bit stands for one key (first key is bit 0).
This can be used to get faster inserts!  Deactivated indexes can be
reactivated by using <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.  keys.
<DT><CODE>-l or --no-symlinks</CODE>
<DD>
Do not follow symbolic links. Normally <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> repairs the
table a symlink points at.  This option doesn't exist in MySQL 4.0,
as MySQL 4.0 will not remove symlinks during repair.
<DT><CODE>-r or --recover</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique
(which is an extremely unlikely error with ISAM/MyISAM tables).
If you want to recover a table, this is the option to try first. Only if
myisamchk reports that the table can't be recovered by <CODE>-r</CODE>, you
should then try <CODE>-o</CODE>.  (Note that in the unlikely case that <CODE>-r</CODE>
fails, the data file is still intact.)
If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-o or --safe-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Uses an old recovery method (reads through all rows in order and updates
all index trees based on the found rows); this is a magnitude slower
than <CODE>-r</CODE>, but can handle a couple of very unlikely cases that
<CODE>-r</CODE> cannot handle.  This recovery method also uses much less disk
space than <CODE>-r</CODE>. Normally one should always first repair with
<CODE>-r</CODE>, and only if this fails use <CODE>-o</CODE>.

If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-n or --sort-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the
temporary files should be very big.  This will not have any effect if you have
fulltext keys in the table.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are stored.
<DT><CODE>--set-character-set=name</CODE>
<DD>
Change the character set used by the index
<DT><CODE>.t or --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path for storing temporary files. If this is not set, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will
use the environment variable <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> for this.
<DT><CODE>-q or --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Faster repair by not modifying the data file. One can give a second
<CODE>-q</CODE> to force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to modify the original datafile in case
of duplicate keys
<DT><CODE>-u or --unpack</CODE>
<DD>
Unpack file packed with myisampack.

<P>
Other actions that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can do, besides repair and check tables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a or --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyze the distribution of keys. This improves join performance by
enabling the join optimizer to better choose in which order it should
join the tables and which keys it should use:
<CODE>myisamchk --describe --verbose table_name'</CODE> or using <CODE>SHOW KEYS</CODE> in
MySQL.
<DT><CODE>-d or --description</CODE>
<DD>
Prints some information about table.
<DT><CODE>-A or --set-auto-increment[=value]</CODE>
<DD>
Force auto_increment to start at this or higher value. If no value is
given, then sets the next auto_increment value to the highest used value
for the auto key + 1.
<DT><CODE>-S or --sort-index</CODE>
<DD>
Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order.
This will optimize seeks and will make table scanning by key faster.
<DT><CODE>-R or --sort-records=#</CODE>
<DD>
Sorts records according to an index.  This makes your data much more localized
and may speed up ranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> operations on
this index. (It may be VERY slow to do a sort the first time!)
To find out a table's index numbers, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE>, which shows a
table's indexes in the same order that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> sees them.  Indexes are
numbered beginning with 1.

<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_memory">4.4.6.6  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Memory Usage</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX543"></A>

</P>
<P>
Memory allocation is important when you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses no more memory than you specify with the <CODE>-O</CODE>
options.  If you are going to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on very large files,
you should first decide how much memory you want it to use.  The default
is to use only about 3M to fix things.  By using larger values, you can
get <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to operate faster.  For example, if you have more
than 32M RAM, you could use options such as these (in addition to any
other options you might specify):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk -O sort=16M -O key=16M -O read=1M -O write=1M ...
</PRE>

<P>
Using <CODE>-O sort=16M</CODE> should probably be enough for most cases.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses temporary files in <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>. If
<CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> points to a memory file system, you may easily get out of
memory errors. If this happens, set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point at some directory
with more space and restart <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When repairing, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will also need a lot of disk space:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Double the size of the record file (the original one and a copy).  This
space is not needed if one does a repair with <CODE>--quick</CODE>, as in this
case only the index file will be re-created.  This space is needed on the
same disk as the original record file!
<LI>

Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old
index file is truncated at start, so one usually ignore this space.
This space is needed on the same disk as the original index file!
<LI>

When using <CODE>--recover</CODE> or <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE>
(but not when using <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>, you will need space for a
sort buffer for:
<CODE>(largest_key + row_pointer_length)*number_of_rows * 2</CODE>.
You can check the length of the keys and the row_pointer_length with
<CODE>myisamchk -dv table</CODE>.
This space is allocated on the temporary disk (specified by <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> or
<CODE>--tmpdir=#</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try to use
<CODE>--safe-recover</CODE> instead of <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> (which is the default on
some systems, like Linux), you can't reliably use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to
check a table when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is using the same table.  If you
can be sure that no one is accessing the tables through <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
while you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, you only have to do <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE> before you start checking the tables.  If you can't
guarantee the above, then you must take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> while you
check the tables.  If you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> while <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is updating
the tables, you may get a warning that a table is corrupt even if it
isn't.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>, you can use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
to check tables at any time.  While you do this, all clients that try
to update the table will wait until <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is ready before
continuing.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair or optimize tables, you
<STRONG>MUST</STRONG> always ensure that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not using
the table (this also applies if you are using <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>).
If you don't take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> you should at least do a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes how to check for and deal with data corruption
in MySQL databases.  If your tables get corrupted a lot you should
try to find the reason for this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table section contains reason for why a table could be
corrupted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_problems">7.1.3  MyISAM table problems.</A>.

</P>
<P>
When performing crash recovery, it is important to understand that each table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in a database corresponds to three files in the database
directory:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>File</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.frm'</TT> </TD><TD> Table definition (form) file
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.MYD'</TT> </TD><TD> Data file
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.MYI'</TT> </TD><TD> Index file
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various ways, but
problems occur most often in data files and index files.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> works by creating a copy of the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> (data) file
row by row. It ends the repair stage by removing the old <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file and renaming the new file to the original file name.  If you use
<CODE>--quick</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not create a temporary <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file, but instead assumes that the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is correct and only
generates a new index file without touching the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file. This
is safe, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> automatically detects if the
<TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is corrupt and aborts the repair in this case.  You can
also give two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options to <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not abort on some errors (like duplicate key) but
instead tries to resolve them by modifying the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file. Normally the use of two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options is useful only if
you have too little free disk space to perform a normal repair.  In this
case you should at least make a backup before running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

to check a table, you should normally run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> without options or
with either the <CODE>-s</CODE> or <CODE>--silent</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -m tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This finds 99.999% of all errors. It checks first all index entries for errors and
then it reads through all rows. It calculates a checksum for all keys in
the rows and verifies that they checksum matches the checksum for the keys
in the index tree.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This does a complete and thorough check of all data (<CODE>-e</CODE> means
``extended check''). It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify
that they indeed point to the correct row.  This may take a LONG time on a
big table with many keys.  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will normally stop after the first
error it finds. If you want to obtain more information, you can add the
<CODE>--verbose</CODE> (<CODE>-v</CODE>) option.  This causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to keep
going, up through a maximum of 20 errors.  In normal usage, a simple
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (with no arguments other than the table name) is sufficient.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e -i tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Like the previous command, but the <CODE>-i</CODE> option tells <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to
print some informational statistics, too.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the following section we only talk about using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <CODE>.MYI</CODE> and <CODE>.MYD</CODE>).  If you
are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <CODE>.ISM</CODE> and <CODE>.ISD</CODE>),
you should use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.14, you can repair MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The symptoms of a corrupted table include queries that abort unexpectedly
and observable errors such as these:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`tbl_name.frm'</TT> is locked against change
<LI>

Can't find file <TT>`tbl_name.MYI'</TT> (Errcode: ###)
<LI>

Unexpected end of file
<LI>

Record file is crashed
<LI>

Got error ### from table handler

To get more information about the error you can run <CODE>perror ###</CODE>. Here 
is the most common errors that indicates a problem with the table:


<PRE>
shell&#62; perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
126 = Index file is crashed / Wrong file format
127 = Record-file is crashed
132 = Old database file
134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
135 = No more room in record file
136 = No more room in index file
141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
</PRE>

Note that error 135, no more room in record file, is not an error that
can be fixed by a simple repair. In this case you have to do:


<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
In the other cases, you must repair your tables. <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
can usually detect and fix most things that go wrong.

</P>
<P>
The repair process involves up to four stages, described below. Before you
begin, you should <CODE>cd</CODE> to the database directory and check the
permissions of the table files. Make sure they are readable by the Unix user
that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as (and to you, because you need to access the files
you are checking).  If it turns out you need to modify files, they must also
be writable by you.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23.16 and above, you can (and 
should) use the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> commands to check and repair 
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The manual section about table maintenance includes the options to
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following section is for the cases where the above command fails or
if you want to use the extended features that <CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> provides.

</P>
<P>
If you are going to repair a table from the command line, you must first
take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. Note that when you do
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> on a remote server, the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
will still be alive for a while after <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> returns, until
all queries are stopped and all keys have been flushed to disk.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 1: Checking your tables</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Run <CODE>myisamchk *.MYI</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk -e *.MYI</CODE> if you have
more time.  Use the <CODE>-s</CODE> (silent) option to suppress unnecessary
information.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is done you should use the --update option to tell
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to mark the table as 'checked'.

</P>
<P>
You have to repair only those tables for which <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> announces an
error.  For such tables, proceed to Stage 2.

</P>
<P>
If you get weird errors when checking (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 2: Easy safe repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
NOTE: If you want repairing to go much faster, you should add: <CODE>-O
sort_buffer=# -O key_buffer=#</CODE> (where # is about 1/4 of the available
memory) to all <CODE>isamchk/myisamchk</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
First, try <CODE>myisamchk -r -q tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r -q</CODE> means ``quick
recovery mode''). This will attempt to repair the index file without
touching the data file.  If the data file contains everything that it
should and the delete links point at the correct locations within the
data file, this should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing the
next table.  Otherwise, use the following procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make a backup of the data file before continuing.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk -r tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r</CODE> means ``recovery mode''). This will
remove incorrect records and deleted records from the data file and
reconstruct the index file.

<LI>

If the preceding step fails, use <CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover tbl_name</CODE>.
Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases that
regular recovery mode doesn't (but is slower).
</OL>

<P>
If you get weird errors when repairing (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 3: Difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should only reach this stage if the first 16K block in the index file is
destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if the index file is
missing.  In this case, it's necessary to create a new index file. Do so as
follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Move the data file to some safe place.

<LI>

Use the table description file to create new (empty) data and index files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql db_name
mysql&#62; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
mysql&#62; quit
</PRE>

If your SQL version doesn't have <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE>, use <CODE>DELETE FROM
table_name</CODE> instead.

<LI>

Copy the old data file back onto the newly created data file.
(Don't just move the old file back onto the new file; you want to retain
a copy in case something goes wrong.)
</OL>

<P>
Go back to Stage 2.  <CODE>myisamchk -r -q</CODE> should work now.  (This shouldn't
be an endless loop.)

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 4: Very difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should reach this stage only if the description file has also
crashed. That should never happen, because the description file isn't changed
after the table is created:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Restore the description file from a backup and go back to Stage 3.  You can
also restore the index file and go back to Stage 2.  In the latter case, you
should start with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't have a backup but know exactly how the table was created, create
a copy of the table in another database.  Remove the new data file, then move
the description and index files from the other database to your crashed
database.  This gives you new description and index files, but leaves
the data file alone.  Go back to Stage 2 and attempt to reconstruct
the index file.
</OL>

<P>
To coalesce fragmented records and eliminate wasted space resulting from
deleting or updating records, run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> in recovery mode:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk -r tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can optimize a table in the same way using the SQL <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>
statement.  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> does a repair of the table, a key
analyzes and also sorts the index tree to give faster key lookups.
There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility
and the server, because the server does all the work when you use
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> also has a number of other options you can use to improve
the performance of a table:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-S, --sort-index</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-R index_num, --sort-records=index_num</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-a, --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
<A NAME="IDX554"></A>

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than
waiting for problems to occur.  For maintenance purposes, you can use
<CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> to check tables.  The <CODE>-s</CODE> option (short for
<CODE>--silent</CODE>) causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to run in silent mode, printing
messages only when errors occur.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
It's also a good idea to check tables when the server starts up.
For example, whenever the machine has done a reboot in the middle of an
update, you usually need to check all the tables that could have been
affected. (This is an ``expected crashed table''.) You could add a test to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> that runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check all tables that have
been modified during the last 24 hours if there is an old <TT>`.pid'</TT>
(process ID) file left after a reboot.  (The <TT>`.pid'</TT> file is created by
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> when it starts up and removed when it terminates normally.  The
presence of a <TT>`.pid'</TT> file at system startup time indicates that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> terminated abnormally.)

</P>
<P>
An even better test would be to check any table whose last-modified time
is more recent than that of the <TT>`.pid'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also check your tables regularly during normal system
operation.  At MySQL AB, we run a <CODE>cron</CODE> job to check all
our important tables once a week, using a line like this in a <TT>`crontab'</TT>
file:

</P>

<PRE>
35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
This prints out information about crashed tables so we can examine and repair
them when needed.

</P>
<P>
As we haven't had any unexpectedly crashed tables (tables that become
corrupted for reasons other than hardware trouble)
for a couple of years now (this is really true), once a week is
more than enough for us.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that to start with, you execute <CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> each
night on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours,
until you come to trust MySQL as much as we do.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
Normally you don't need to maintain MySQL tables that much.  If 
you are changing tables with dynamic size rows (tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns) or have tables with many deleted rows
you may want to from time to time (once a month?) defragment/reclaim space
from the tables.

</P>
<P>
You can do this by using <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on the tables in question or
if you can take the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server down for a while do:

</P>

<PRE>
isamchk -r --silent --sort-index -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.ISM
myisamchk -r --silent --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI
</PRE>

To get a description of a table or statistics about it, use the commands shown
below. We explain some of the information in more detail later:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -d tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> in ``describe mode'' to produce a description of
your table. If you start the MySQL server using the
<CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> option, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> may report an error for a
table that is updated while it runs.  However, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
doesn't change the table in describe mode, there isn't any risk of
destroying data.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -d -v tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
To produce more information about what <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is doing, add <CODE>-v</CODE>
to tell it to run in verbose mode.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -eis tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Shows only the most important information from a table. It is slow because it
must read the whole table.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -eiv tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This is like <CODE>-eis</CODE>, but tells you what is being done.

<DD>
How many deleted blocks still have reserved space.
You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimization">4.4.6.10  Table Optimization</A>.

<DT><CODE>Datafile: Parts</CODE>
<DD>
For dynamic record format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For
an optimized table without fragmented records, this is the same as <CODE>Data
records</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>Deleted data</CODE>
<DD>
How many bytes of non-reclaimed deleted data there are.
You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimization">4.4.6.10  Table Optimization</A>.

<DT><CODE>Datafile pointer</CODE>
<DD>
The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3, 4, or 5
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this cannot be controlled
from MySQL yet. For fixed tables, this is a record address. For
dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

<DT><CODE>Keyfile pointer</CODE>
<DD>
The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2, or 3
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this is calculated
automatically by MySQL. It is always a block address.

<DT><CODE>Max datafile length</CODE>
<DD>
How long the table's data file (<CODE>.MYD</CODE> file) can become, in bytes.

<DT><CODE>Max keyfile length</CODE>
<DD>
How long the table's key file (<CODE>.MYI</CODE> file) can become, in bytes.

<DT><CODE>Recordlength</CODE>
<DD>
How much space each record takes, in bytes.

<DT><CODE>Record format</CODE>
<DD>
The format used to store table rows.
The examples shown above use <CODE>Fixed length</CODE>.
Other possible values are <CODE>Compressed</CODE> and <CODE>Packed</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>table description</CODE>
<DD>
A list of all keys in the table. For each key, some low-level information
is presented:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Key</CODE>
<DD>
This key's number.

<DT><CODE>Start</CODE>
<DD>
Where in the record this index part starts.

<DT><CODE>Len</CODE>
<DD>
How long this index part is. For packed numbers, this should always be
the full length of the column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full
length of the indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a string
column.

<DT><CODE>Index</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>unique</CODE> or <CODE>multip.</CODE> (multiple). Indicates whether or not one value
can exist multiple times in this index.

<DT><CODE>Type</CODE>
<DD>
What data-type this index part has. This is an ISAM data-type
with the options <CODE>packed</CODE>, <CODE>stripped</CODE> or <CODE>empty</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>Root</CODE>
<DD>
Address of the root index block.

<DT><CODE>Blocksize</CODE>
<DD>
The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but the value may be
changed at compile time.

<DT><CODE>Rec/key</CODE>
<DD>
This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells how many
records there are per value for this key. A unique key always has a
value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or greatly
changed) with <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE>. If this is not updated at all, a default
value of 30 is given.
</DL>

<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>
In the first example above, the 9th key is a multi-part key with two parts.

<DT><CODE>Keyblocks used</CODE>
<DD>
What percentage of the keyblocks are used. Because the table used in the
examples had just been reorganized with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, the values are very
high (very near the theoretical maximum).

<DT><CODE>Packed</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL tries to pack keys with a common suffix. This can only be used
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE>/<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>/<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> keys. For long strings like
names, this can significantly reduce the space used. In the third example
above, the 4th key is 10 characters long and a 60% reduction in space is
achieved.

<DT><CODE>Max levels</CODE>
<DD>
How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long keys get high
values.

<DT><CODE>Records</CODE>
<DD>
How many rows are in the table.

<DT><CODE>M.recordlength</CODE>
<DD>
The average record length. For tables with fixed-length records, this is the
exact record length.

<DT><CODE>Packed</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The <CODE>Packed</CODE>
value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.

<DT><CODE>Recordspace used</CODE>
<DD>
What percentage of the data file is used.

<DT><CODE>Empty space</CODE>
<DD>
What percentage of the data file is unused.

<DT><CODE>Blocks/Record</CODE>
<DD>
Average number of blocks per record (that is, how many links a fragmented
record is composed of). This is always 1 for fixed-format tables. This value
should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets too big, you can
reorganize the table with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimization">4.4.6.10  Table Optimization</A>.

<DT><CODE>Recordblocks</CODE>
<DD>
How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed format, this is the same as the number
of records.

<DT><CODE>Deleteblocks</CODE>
<DD>
How many blocks (links) are deleted.

<DT><CODE>Recorddata</CODE>
<DD>
How many bytes in the data file are used.

<DT><CODE>Deleted data</CODE>
<DD>
How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused).

<DT><CODE>Lost space</CODE>
<DD>
If a record is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost. This is
the sum of all such losses, in bytes.

<DT><CODE>Linkdata</CODE>
<DD>
When the dynamic table format is used, record fragments are linked with
pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). <CODE>Linkdata</CODE> is the sum of the amount of
storage used by all such pointers.
</DL>

<P>
If a table has been compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk
-d</CODE> prints additional information about each table column.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>, for an example of this
information and a description of what it means.

OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name]...
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> should be used if you have deleted a large part of a
table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows
(tables that have <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns).
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations reuse old record positions. You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the data file.

</P>
<P>
For the moment <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> only works on <STRONG>MyISAM</STRONG> and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables. For <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
currently mapped to <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get optimize table to work on other table types by starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> or <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>, but in this
case <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is just mapped to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

<UL>
<LI>

If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
<LI>

If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
<LI>

If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be done
by sorting the index), update them.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables is equvialent of running
<CODE>myisamchk --quick --check-changed-tables --sort-index --analyze</CODE>
on the table.

</P>
<P>
Note that the table is locked during the time <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
running!

<PRE>
ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...]
</PRE>

<P>
Analyze and store the key distribution for the table.  During the
analyze the table is locked with a read lock.  This works on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to running <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses the stored key distribution to decide in which order
tables should be joined when one does a join on something else than a
constant.

</P>
<P>
The command returns a table with the following columns:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<P>
You can check the stored key distribution with the <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_DATABASE_INFO">4.5.5.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.

<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> errors occur in a row for a given host while
connection to the MySQL server, MySQL assumes
something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection requests.
Flushing the host tables allows the host to attempt to connect
again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Blocked_host">A.2.4  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A>.) You can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with

by one relative to the previous file.  If you have used an extension in
the file name, MySQL will close and reopen the update log file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>. This is the same thing as sending the <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>

<UL>
<LI>

In <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> loops, the flag is
checked after reading a block of rows. If the kill flag is set the

<LI>

When doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> the kill flag is checked before each block of
rows are read from the original table. If the kill flag was set the command
is aborted and the temporary table is deleted.
<LI>

When doing an <CODE>UPDATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE TABLE</CODE>, the kill flag
is checked after each block read and after each updated or delete
row. If the kill flag is set the statement is aborted.  Note that if you
are not using transactions, the changes will not be rolled back!
<LI>

<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> will abort with <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<P>
Some comments about the above:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
variable is probably too small.
<LI>

If <CODE>key_reads</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> variable is
probably too small.  The cache hit rate can be calculated with
<CODE>key_reads</CODE>/<CODE>key_read_requests</CODE>.
<LI>

If <CODE>Handler_read_rnd</CODE> is big, then you probably have a lot of
queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables or you have
joins that don't use keys properly.
<LI>

If <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> is big, you may want to increase the
<CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable.
</UL>

a new thread. The <CODE>back_log</CODE> value indicates how many requests can be
stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily stops
answering new requests. You need to increase this only if you expect a large
number of connections in a short period of time.

In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for incoming
TCP/IP connections.  Your operating system has its own limit on the size
of this queue.  The manual page for the Unix <CODE>listen(2)</CODE> system
call should have more details.  Check your OS documentation for the
maximum value for this variable.  Attempting to set <CODE>back_log</CODE>
higher than your operating system limit will be ineffective.

<DT><CODE><CODE>basedir</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_cache_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_log_buffer_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should set this to 0 or
start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_home</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--bdb-home</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of locks (1000 by default) you can have active on a
BDB table. You should increase this if you get errors of type <CODE>bdb:
Lock table is out of available locks</CODE> or <CODE>Got error 12 from ...</CODE>
when you have do long transactions or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has to examine
a lot of rows to calculate the query.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_logdir</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--bdb-logdir</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_shared_data</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you are using <CODE>--bdb-shared-data</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>bdb_tmpdir</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--bdb-tmpdir</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE>.  The size of the cache to hold the SQL</CODE>
<DD>
statements for the binary log during a transaction.  If you often use
big, multi-statement transactions you can increase this to get more
performance. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>character_set</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The default character set.

<DT><CODE><CODE>character_sets</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The supported character sets.

<DT><CODE><CODE>concurrent_inserts</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>ON</CODE> (the default), MySQL will allow you to use <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time as you run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries
on them.  You can turn this option off by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--safe</CODE>
or <CODE>--skip-new</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX593"></A>
<DT><CODE><CODE>connect_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is waiting for a connect
packet before responding with <CODE>Bad handshake</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>datadir</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--datadir</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>delay_key_write</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If enabled (is on by default), MySQL will honor the
<CODE>delay_key_write</CODE> option <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  This means that the
key buffer for tables with this option will not get flushed on every
index update, but only when a table is closed.  This will speed up
writes on keys a lot, but you should add automatic checking of all tables
with <CODE>myisamchk --fast --force</CODE> if you use this.  Note that if you
start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--delay-key-write-for-all-tables</CODE>
option this means that all tables will be treated as if they were
created with the <CODE>delay_key_write</CODE> option.  You can clear this flag
by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> or <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
After inserting <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows, the <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler will check if there are any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements
pending. If so, it allows these to execute before continuing.

<DT><CODE><CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
How long a <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> thread should wait for <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements before terminating.

<DT><CODE><CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for handling <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE>.  If the queue becomes full, any client that does <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> will wait until there is room in the queue again.

<DT><CODE><CODE>flush</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
This is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you have started MySQL with the <CODE>--flush</CODE>
option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>flush_time</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If this is set to a non-zero value, then every <CODE>flush_time</CODE> seconds all
tables will be closed (to free up resources and sync things to disk). We
only recommend this option on Win95, Win98, or on systems where you have
very little resources.

<DT><CODE><CODE>have_bdb</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports Berkeley DB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> is used.
<DT><CODE><CODE>have_innodb</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports InnoDB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE> is used.
<DT><CODE><CODE>have_raid</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option.
<DT><CODE><CODE>have_ssl</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports SSL (encryption) on the client/server
protocol.

<DT><CODE><CODE>init_file</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The name of the file specified with the <CODE>--init-file</CODE> option when
you start the server.  This is a file of SQL statements you want the
server to execute when it starts.

<DT><CODE><CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an interactive
connection before closing it.  An interactive client is defined as a
client that uses the <CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.  See also <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>join_buffer_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The size of the buffer that is used for full joins (joins that do not
use indexes).  The buffer is allocated one time for each full join
between two tables. Increase this value to get a faster full join when
adding indexes is not possible. (Normally the best way to get fast joins
is to add indexes.)

<A NAME="IDX594"></A>
<DT><CODE><CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Index blocks are buffered and are shared by all threads.
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is the size of the buffer used for index blocks.

Increase this to get better index handling (for all reads and multiple
writes) to as much as you can afford; 64M on a 256M machine that mainly
runs MySQL is quite common.  If you, however, make this too big
(more than 50% of your total memory?) your system may start to page and
become REALLY slow. Remember that because MySQL does not cache
data read, that you will have to leave some room for the OS filesystem
cache.

You can check the performance of the key buffer by doing <CODE>show
status</CODE> and examine the variables <CODE>Key_read_requests</CODE>,
<CODE>Key_reads</CODE>, <CODE>Key_write_requests</CODE>, and <CODE>Key_writes</CODE>.  The
<CODE>Key_reads/Key_read_request</CODE> ratio should normally be &#60; 0.01.
The <CODE>Key_write/Key_write_requests</CODE> is usually near 1 if you are
using mostly updates/deletes but may be much smaller if you tend to
do updates that affect many at the same time or if you are
using <CODE>delay_key_write</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.5  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To get even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.2  <CODE>LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>language</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The language used for error messages.

<DT><CODE><CODE>large_file_support</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was compiled with options for big file support.

<DT><CODE><CODE>locked_in_memory</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was locked in memory with <CODE>--memlock</CODE>

<DT><CODE><CODE>log</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If logging of all queries is enabled.

<DT><CODE><CODE>log_update</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If the update log is enabled.

<DT><CODE><CODE>log_bin</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If the binary log is enabled.

<DT><CODE><CODE>log_slave_updates</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If the updates from the slave should be logged.

<DT><CODE><CODE>long_query_time</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If a query takes longer than this (in seconds), the <CODE>Slow_queries</CODE> counter
will be incremented. If you are using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, the query
will be logged to the slow query logfile. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If set to 1 table names are stored in lowercase on disk and table
names will be case-insensitive.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The maximum size of one packet. The message buffer is initialized to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes, but can grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>
bytes when needed.  This value by default is small, to catch big (possibly
wrong) packets.  You must increase this value if you are using big
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. It should be as big as the biggest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> you want
to use.  The current protocol limits <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to 16M.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If a multi-statement transaction requires more than this amount of memory,
one will get the error "Multi-statement transaction required more than
'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage".

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Available after 3.23.33. If a write to the binary (replication) log exceeds 
the given value, rotate the logs. You cannot set it to less than 1024 bytes, 
or more than 1 GB. Default is 1 GB.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_connections</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of simultaneous clients allowed. Increasing this value increases
the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.  See below for
comments on file descriptor limits. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Too_many_connections">A.2.5  <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> Error</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If there is more than this number of interrupted connections from a host
this host will be blocked from further connections.  You can unblock a host
with the command <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_delayed_threads</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Don't start more than this number of threads to handle <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
statements.  If you try to insert data into a new table after all <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> threads are in use, the row will be inserted as if the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute wasn't specified.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow creation of heap tables bigger than this.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_join_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Joins that are probably going to read more than <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
records return an error. Set this value if your users tend to perform joins
that lack a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, that take a long time, and that return
millions of rows.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_sort_length</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of bytes to use when sorting <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
values (only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of each value
are used; the rest are ignored).

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_user_connections</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of active connections for a single user (0 = no limit).

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_tmp_tables</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
(This option doesn't yet do anything.)
Maximum number of temporary tables a client can keep open at the same time.

<DT><CODE><CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
After this many write locks, allow some read locks to run in between.

<DT><CODE><CODE>myisam_recover_options</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>myisam_sort_buffer_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when doing a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or when creating indexes with <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> or
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE>.</CODE>
<DD>
If the creating of the temporary file for fast index creation would be
this much bigger than using the key cache, then prefer the key cache
method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in large
tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes!

<DT><CODE><CODE>myisam_max_sort_file_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use
while recreating the index (during <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If the file size would be bigger than this,
the index will be created through the key cache (which is slower).
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes!

<DT><CODE><CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The communication buffer is reset to this size between queries. This
should not normally be changed, but if you have very little memory, you
can set it to the expected size of a query.  (That is, the expected length of
SQL statements sent by clients.  If statements exceed this length, the buffer
is automatically enlarged, up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.)

<DT><CODE><CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before aborting
the read.  Note that when we don't expect data from a connection, the timeout
is defined by <CODE>write_timeout</CODE>. See also <CODE>slave_read_timeout</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>net_retry_count</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If a read on a communication port is interrupted, retry this many times
before giving up.  This value should be quite high on <CODE>FreeBSD</CODE> as
internal interrupts are sent to all threads.

<DT><CODE><CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Number of seconds to wait for a block to be written to a connection before
aborting the write.

<DT><CODE><CODE>open_files_limit</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If this is not 0, then <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will use this value to reserve file
descriptors to use with <CODE>setrlimit()</CODE>.  If this value is 0 then
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will reserve <CODE>max_connections*5</CODE> or
<CODE>max_connections + table_cache*2</CODE> (whichever is larger) number of
files.  You should try increasing this if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gives you the
error 'Too many open files'.

<DT><CODE><CODE>pid_file</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--pid-file</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>port</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--port</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>protocol_version</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The protocol version used by the MySQL server.

<DT><CODE><CODE>record_buffer</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this
size for each table it scans. If you do many sequential scans, you may
want to increase this value.

<DT><CODE><CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read through this
buffer to avoid a disk seeks.  If not set, then it's set to the value of
<CODE>record_buffer</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>query_buffer_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The initial allocation of the query buffer. If most of your queries are
long (like when inserting blobs), you should increase this!

<DT><CODE><CODE>safe_show_databases</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any database or
table privileges. This can improve security if you're concerned about
people being able to see what databases other users have. See also
<CODE>skip_show_databases</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>server_id</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The value of the <CODE>--server-id</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE><CODE>skip_locking</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Is OFF if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses external locking.

<DT><CODE><CODE>skip_networking</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Is ON if we only allow local (socket) connections.

<DT><CODE><CODE>skip_show_databases</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
This prevents people from doing <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> if they don't have
the <CODE>PROCESS_PRIV</CODE> privilege. This can improve security if you're
concerned about people being able to see what databases other users
have. See also <CODE>safe_show_databases</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>slave_read_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Number of seconds to wait for more data from a master/slave connection
before aborting the read.

<DT><CODE><CODE>slow_launch_time</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in seconds), the
<CODE>Slow_launch_threads</CODE> counter will be incremented.

<DT><CODE><CODE>socket</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The Unix socket used by the server.

<DT><CODE><CODE>sort_buffer</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this
size. Increase this value for faster <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
operations.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>table_cache</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
increases the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.
MySQL needs two file descriptors for each unique open table.
See below for comments on file descriptor limits. You can check if you
need to increase the table cache by checking the <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE>
variable. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.5  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.  If this variable is big and you don't do
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> a lot (which just forces all tables to be closed and
reopenend), then you should increase the value of this variable.

Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open file
descriptors implied by the <CODE>table_cache</CODE> setting.  If <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
is set too high, MySQL may run out of file descriptors and refuse
connections, fail to perform queries, and be very unreliable.

For information about how the table cache works, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.6  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>table_type</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The default table type

<DT><CODE><CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse.  When a
client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there
aren't more than <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> threads from before.  All new
threads are first taken from the cache, and only when the cache is empty
is a new thread created.  This variable can be increased to improve
performance if you have a lot of new connections. (Normally this doesn't
give a notable performance improvement if you have a good
thread implementation.)  By examing the difference between
the <CODE>Connections</CODE> and <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> you can see how efficient
the current thread cache is for you.

<DT><CODE><CODE>thread_concurrency</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
On Solaris, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will call <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> with
this value.  <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> permits the application to give
the threads system a hint for the desired number of threads that should
be run at the same time.

<DT><CODE><CODE>thread_stack</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The stack size for each thread.  Many of the limits detected by the
<CODE>crash-me</CODE> test are dependent on this value. The default is
large enough for normal operation.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>timezone</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The timezone for the server.

<DT><CODE><CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL
will automatically convert it to an on-disk <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
Increase the value of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> if you do many advanced
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries and you have lots of memory.

<DT><CODE><CODE>tmpdir</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The directory used for temporary files and temporary tables.

<DT><CODE><CODE>version</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The version number for the server.

<DT><CODE><CODE>wait_timeout</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a connection before
closing it. See also <CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE>.

<P>
This command is very useful if you get the 'too many connections' error

<P>
<A NAME="IDX600"></A>
<A NAME="IDX601"></A>
<A NAME="IDX602"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set
with sorting according to Swedish/Finnish. This is the character set suitable
in the USA and western Europe.

</P>
<P>
All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-charsets=complex</CODE>.  This will add code to all
standard programs to be able to handle <CODE>latin1</CODE> and all multi-byte
character sets within the binary. Other character sets will be
loaded from a character-set definition file when needed.

</P>
<P>
The character set determines what characters are allowed in names and how
things are sorted by the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses of
the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
You can change the character set with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>
option when you start the server.  The character sets available depend
on the <CODE>--with-charset=charset</CODE> and <CODE>--with-extra-charset=
list-of-charset | complex | all</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>, and the
character set configuration files listed in
<TT>`SHAREDIR/charsets/Index'</TT>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may
also change the sort order), you must run myisamchk -r -q on all
tables. Otherwise your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

</P>
<P>
When a client connects to a MySQL server, the server sends the
default character set in use to the client.  The client will switch to
use this character set for this connection.

</P>
<P>
One should use <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> when escaping strings
for a SQL query.  <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> is identical to the
old <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function, except that it takes the MYSQL
connection handle as the first parameter.

</P>
<P>
If the client is compiled with different paths than where the server is
installed and the user who configured MySQL didn't included all
character sets in the MySQL binary, one must specify for
the client where it can find the additional character sets it will need
if the server runs with a different character set than the client.

</P>
<P>
One can specify this by putting in a MySQL option file:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets
</PRE>

<P>
where the path points to where the dynamic MySQL character sets
are stored.

</P>
<P>
One can force the client to use specific character set by specifying:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
default-character-set=character-set-name
</PRE>

<P>
but normally this is never needed.

</P>
<P>
To add another character set to MySQL, use the following procedure.

</P>
<P>
Decide if the set is simple or complex.  If the character set
does not need to use special string collating routines for
sorting and does not need multi-byte character support, it is
simple.  If it needs either of those features, it is complex.

</P>
<P>
For example, <CODE>latin1</CODE> and <CODE>danish</CODE> are simple charactersets while
<CODE>big5</CODE> or <CODE>czech</CODE> are complex character sets.

</P>
<P>
In the following section, we have assumed that you name your character
set <CODE>MYSET</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a simple character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file
Assign an unique number to it.

<LI>

Create the file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/MYSET.conf'</TT>.
(You can use <TT>`sql/share/charsets/latin1.conf'</TT> as a base for this).

The syntax for the file very simple:


<UL>
<LI>

Comments start with a '#' character and proceed to the end of the line.
<LI>

Words are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
<LI>

When defining the character set, every word must be a number in hexadecimal
format
<LI>

The <CODE>ctype</CODE> array takes up the first 257 words. The
<CODE>to_lower</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper</CODE> and <CODE>sort_order</CODE> arrays take up
256 words each after that.
</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The character definition arrays</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.

</OL>

<P>
For a complex character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Create the file <TT>`strings/ctype-MYSET.c'</TT> in the MySQL source
distribution.

<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file.
Assign an unique number to it.

<LI>

Look at one of the existing <TT>`ctype-*.c'</TT> files to see what needs to
be defined, for example <TT>`strings/ctype-big5.c'</TT>. Note that the
arrays in your file must have names like <CODE>ctype_MYSET</CODE>,
<CODE>to_lower_MYSET</CODE>, and so on.  This corresponds to the arrays
in the simple character set. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The character definition arrays</A>.  For a complex
character set

<LI>

Near the top of the file, place a special comment like this:


<PRE>
/*
 * This comment is parsed by configure to create ctype.c,
 * so don't change it unless you know what you are doing.
 *
 * .configure. number_MYSET=MYNUMBER
 * .configure. strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N
 * .configure. mbmaxlen_MYSET=N
 */
</PRE>

The <CODE>configure</CODE> program uses this comment to include
the character set into the MySQL library automatically.

The strxfrm_multiply and mbmaxlen lines will be explained in
the following sections.  Only include them if you the string
collating functions or the multi-byte character set functions,
respectively.

<LI>

You should then create some of the following functions:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>my_strncoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strcoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strxfrm_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_like_range_MYSET()</CODE>

</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.
</OL>

<P>
The file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/README'</TT> includes some more instructions.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have the character set included in the MySQL
distribution, mail a patch to <a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Character_arrays" HREF="manual_toc.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The character definition arrays</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>to_lower[]</CODE> and <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> are simple arrays that hold the
lowercase and uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the
character set.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
to_lower['A'] should contain 'a'
to_upper['a'] should contain 'A'
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> is a map indicating how characters should be ordered for
comparison and sorting purposes.  For many character sets, this is the same as
<CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> (which means sorting will be case insensitive).
MySQL will sort characters based on the value of
<CODE>sort_order[character]</CODE>.  For more complicated sorting rules, see
the discussion of string collating below. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is an array of bit values, with one element for one character.
(Note that <CODE>to_lower[]</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE>, and <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE>
are indexed by character value, but <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is indexed by character
value + 1.  This is an old legacy to be able to handle EOF.)

</P>
<P>
You can find the following bitmask definitions in <TT>`m_ctype.h'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
#define _U      01      /* Uppercase */
#define _L      02      /* Lowercase */
#define _N      04      /* Numeral (digit) */
#define _S      010     /* Spacing character */
#define _P      020     /* Punctuation */
#define _C      040     /* Control character */
#define _B      0100    /* Blank */
#define _X      0200    /* heXadecimal digit */
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> entry for each character should be the union of the
applicable bitmask values that describe the character.  For example,
<CODE>'A'</CODE> is an uppercase character (<CODE>_U</CODE>) as well as a
hexadecimal digit (<CODE>_X</CODE>), so <CODE>ctype['A'+1]</CODE> should contain the
value:

</P>

<PRE>
_U + _X = 01 + 0200 = 0201

convenience of other MySQL users.

<A NAME="IDX632"></A>
<DT><CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>
<DD>
A shell script that converts <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to MySQL. It doesn't
handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

<A NAME="IDX633"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>
<DD>
A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and database
combination.

<A NAME="IDX634"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
<DD>
Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating or
dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables to disk, and
reopening log files.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can also be used to retrieve version,
process, and status information from the server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqladmin">4.8.3  mysqladmin, Administrating a MySQL Server</A>.

<A NAME="IDX635"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>

filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

<A NAME="IDX636"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DD>
The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

<A NAME="IDX637"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or
as tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor Romanenko.

The <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script is written so that it normally is able to start
a server that was installed from either a source or a binary version of
MySQL, even if these install the server in slightly different
locations.  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> expects one of these conditions to be true:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The server and databases can be found relative to the directory from which
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> is invoked.  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> looks under its working
directory for <TT>`bin'</TT> and <TT>`data'</TT> directories (for binary
distributions) or for <TT>`libexec'</TT> and <TT>`var'</TT> directories (for source
distributions).  This condition should be met if you execute
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> from your MySQL installation directory (for
example, <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> for a binary distribution).

<LI>

If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working directory,
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> attempts to locate them by absolute pathnames.  Typical
locations are <TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT> and <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>.
The actual locations are determined when the distribution was built from which
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> comes.  They should be correct if
MySQL was installed in a standard location.
</UL>

<P>
Because <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will try to find the server and databases relative
to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
MySQL anywhere, as long as you start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> from the
MySQL installation directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> fails, even when invoked from the MySQL
installation directory, you can modify it to use the path to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
and the pathname options that are correct for your system.  Note that if you
upgrade MySQL in the future, your modified version of
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will be overwritten, so you should make a copy of your
edited version that you can reinstall.

any GNR, or several of them at the same time. (See --example) The GNRs
list can be comma separated, or a dash combined, of which the latter
means that all the GNRs between GNR1-GNR2 will be affected. Without
GNR argument all the found groups will be either started, stopped, or
reported. Note that you must not have any white spaces in the GNR
list. Anything after a white space is ignored.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--config-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX649"></A>
 
Alternative config file. NOTE: This will not affect this program's own
options (group <CODE>[mysqld_multi]</CODE>), but only groups
[mysqld#]. Without this option everything will be searched from the
ordinary my.cnf file.
<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
<DT><CODE>--example</CODE>
<DD>
Give an example of a config file.
<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Print this help and exit.
<A NAME="IDX652"></A>
<DT><CODE>--log=...</CODE>
<DD>
Log file. Full path to and the name for the log file. NOTE: If the file
exists, everything will be appended.
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqladmin=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> binary to be used for a server shutdown.
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqld=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary to be used. Note that you can give
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to this option also. The options are passed to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. Just make sure you have <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in your environment
variable <CODE>PATH</CODE> or fix <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX655"></A>
<DT><CODE>--no-log</CODE>
<DD>
Print to stdout instead of the log file. By default the log file is
turned on.
<A NAME="IDX656"></A>
<DT><CODE>--password=...</CODE>
<DD>
Password for user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX657"></A>
<DT><CODE>--tcp-ip</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to the MySQL server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead of
the UNIX socket. This affects stopping and reporting.  If a socket file
is missing, the server may still be running, but can be accessed only
via the TCP/IP port.  By default connecting is done via the UNIX socket.
<A NAME="IDX658"></A>
<DT><CODE>--user=...</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX659"></A>
<DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the version number and exit.

<P>
Some notes about <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that the MySQL user, who is stopping the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> services (e.g using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>) have the same
password and username for all the data directories accessed (to the
'mysql' database) And make sure that the user has the 'Shutdown_priv'
privilege! If you have many data- directories and many different 'mysql'
databases with different passwords for the MySQL 'root' user,
you may want to create a common 'multi_admin' user for each using the
same password (see below). Example how to do it:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -proot_password -e
"GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO multi_admin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass'"
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.5  How the Privilege System Works</A>.
</PRE>

You will have to do the above for each <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running in each
data directory, that you have (just change the socket, -S=...)
<LI>

<CODE>pid-file</CODE> is very important, if you are using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (e.g. --mysqld=safe_mysqld) Every <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
should have its own <CODE>pid-file</CODE>. The advantage using
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> instead of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly here is, that
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> 'guards' every <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process and will restart
it, if a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process fails due to signal kill -9, or
similar. (Like segmentation fault, which MySQL should never do,
of course ;) Please note that <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script may require that
you start it from a certain place. This means that you may have to CD to
a certain directory, before you start the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>. If
you have problems starting, please see the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
script. Check especially the lines:

<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY_PWD=`pwd` Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary
release) if test -d /data/mysql -a -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys
-a -x ./bin/mysqld
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld</A>.
</PRE>

The above test should be successful, or you may encounter problems.
<LI>

Beware of the dangers starting multiple <CODE>mysqlds</CODE> in the same data
directory.  Use separate data directories, unless you <STRONG>KNOW</STRONG> what
you are doing!
<LI>

The socket file and the TCP/IP port must be different for every <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

The first and fifth <CODE>mysqld</CODE> group were intentionally left out from
the example.  You may have 'gaps' in the config file. This gives you
more flexibility.  The order in which the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE> are started or
stopped depends on the order in which they appear in the config file.
<LI>

When you want to refer to a certain group using GNR with this program,
just use the number in the end of the group name ( [mysqld# &#60;== ).
<LI>

You may want to use option '--user' for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, but in order to
do this you need to be root when you start the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>
script. Having the option in the config file doesn't matter; you will
just get a warning, if you are not the superuser and the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE>
are started under <STRONG>YOUR</STRONG> UNIX account. <STRONG>IMPORTANT</STRONG>: Make
sure that the <CODE>pid-file</CODE> and the data directory are
read+write(+execute for the latter one) accessible for <STRONG>THAT</STRONG>
UNIX user, who the specific <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is started
as. <STRONG>DON'T</STRONG> use the UNIX root account for this, unless you
<STRONG>KNOW</STRONG> what you are doing!
<LI>

<STRONG>MOST IMPORTANT</STRONG>: Make sure that you understand the meanings of
the options that are passed to the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE> and why <STRONG>WOULD
YOU WANT</STRONG> to have separate <CODE>mysqld</CODE> processes. Starting multiple
<CODE>mysqlds</CODE> in one data directory <STRONG>WILL NOT</STRONG> give you extra
performance in a threaded system!

<H3><A NAME="myisampack" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is used to compress MyISAM tables, and <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>
is used to compress ISAM tables. Because ISAM tables are deprecated, we
will only discuss <CODE>myisampack</CODE> here, but everything said about
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> should also be true for <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> works by compressing each column in the table separately.
The information needed to decompress columns is read into memory when the
table is opened. This results in much better performance when accessing
individual records, because you only have to uncompress exactly one record, not
a much larger disk block as when using Stacker on MS-DOS.
Usually, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the data file 40%-70%.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses memory mapping (<CODE>mmap()</CODE>) on compressed tables and
falls back to normal read/write file usage if <CODE>mmap()</CODE> doesn't work.

</P>
<P>
There are currently two limitations with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>:

<UL>
<LI>

After packing, the table is read-only.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can also pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns. The
older <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> could not do this.
</UL>

<P>
Fixing these limitations is on our TODO list but with low priority.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisampack [options] filename ...
</PRE>

<P>
Each filename should be the name of an index (<TT>`.MYI'</TT>) file.  If you
are not in the database directory, you should specify the pathname to the
file.  It is permissible to omit the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> extension.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b, --backup</CODE>
<DD>
Make a backup of the table as <CODE>tbl_name.OLD</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=debug_options</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. The <CODE>debug_options</CODE> string often is
<CODE>'d:t:o,filename'</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Force packing of the table even if it becomes bigger or if the temporary file
exists.  <CODE>myisampack</CODE> creates a temporary file named <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT>
while it compresses the table.  If you kill <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, the <TT>`.TMD'</TT>
file may not be deleted.  Normally, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> exits with an error if
it finds that <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT> exists.  With <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the table anyway.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>-j big_tbl_name, --join=big_tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Join all tables named on the command line into a single table
<CODE>big_tbl_name</CODE>.  All tables that are to be combined
MUST be identical (same column names and types, same indexes, etc.).

<DT><CODE>-p #, --packlength=#</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the record length storage size, in bytes.  The value should be 1, 2,
or 3.  (<CODE>myisampack</CODE> stores all rows with length pointers of 1, 2, or 3
bytes.  In most normal cases, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> can determine the right length
value before it begins packing the file, but it may notice during the packing
process that it could have used a shorter length. In this case,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> will print a note that the next time you pack the same file,
you could use a shorter record length.)

<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

<DT><CODE>-t, --test</CODE>
<DD>
Don't actually pack table, just test packing it.

<DT><CODE>-T dir_name, --tmp_dir=dir_name</CODE>
<DD>
Use the named directory as the location in which to write the temporary table.

<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Write information about progress and packing result.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Display version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-w, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Wait and retry if table is in use.  If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server was
invoked with the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> option, it is not a good idea to
invoke <CODE>myisampack</CODE> if the table might be updated during the
packing process.

After you have run <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>/<CODE>myisampack</CODE> you must run
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to re-create the index.  At this time you
can also sort the index blocks and create statistics needed for
the MySQL optimizer to work more efficiently:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.MYI
isamchk   -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.ISM

<P>
After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL database
directory you should do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> to force <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
to start using the new table.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX684"></A>
 
Utility to describe, check, optimize, and repair MySQL tables.

chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  MySQL Database Administration</A>.

<A NAME="IDX685"></A>
<DT><CODE>make_binary_distribution</CODE>
<DD>
Makes a binary release of a compiled MySQL. This could be sent
by FTP to <TT>`/pub/mysql/Incoming'</TT> on <CODE>support.mysql.com</CODE> for the
convenience of other MySQL users.

<A NAME="IDX686"></A>
<DT><CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>
<DD>
A shell script that converts <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to MySQL. It doesn't
handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

<A NAME="IDX687"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>
<DD>
A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and database
combination.

<A NAME="IDX688"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
<DD>
Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating or
dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables to disk, and
reopening log files.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can also be used to retrieve version,
process, and status information from the server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqladmin">4.8.3  mysqladmin, Administrating a MySQL Server</A>.

<A NAME="IDX689"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL bug report script.  This script should always be used when
filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

<A NAME="IDX690"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DD>
The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

<A NAME="IDX691"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or
as tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor Romanenko.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.5  mysqldump, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.

<A NAME="IDX692"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>
<DD>
Imports text files into their respective tables using <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlimport">4.8.7  mysqlimport, Importing Data from Text Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX693"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>
<DD>
Displays information about databases, tables, columns, and indexes.

<A NAME="IDX694"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
<DD>
Creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. This is
usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL
on a system.

<A NAME="IDX695"></A>
<DT><CODE>replace</CODE>
<DD>
A utility program that is used by <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>, but that has more
general applicability as well.  <CODE>replace</CODE> changes strings in place in
files or on the standard input. Uses a finite state machine to match longer
strings first. Can be used to swap strings. For example, this command
swaps <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> in the given files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

<CODE>mysql</CODE> is a simple SQL shell (with GNU <CODE>readline</CODE> capabilities).
It supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used interactively,
query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
tab-separated format.  (The output format can be changed using command-line
options.)  You can run scripts simply like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; script.sql &#62; output.tab
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems due to insufficient memory in the client, use the
<CODE>--quick</CODE> option!  This forces <CODE>mysql</CODE> to use
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> rather than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to
retrieve the result set.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>mysql</CODE> is very easy. Just start it as follows:
<CODE>mysql database</CODE> or <CODE>mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password database</CODE>. Type a SQL statement, end it with <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\g'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`\G'</SAMP>
and press RETURN/ENTER.

mysql&#62; help

MySQL commands:
help    (\h)    Display this text.
?       (\h)    Synonym for `help'.
clear   (\c)    Clear command.
connect (\r)    Reconnect to the server. Optional arguments are db and host.
edit    (\e)    Edit command with $EDITOR.
ego     (\G)    Send command to mysql server, display result vertically.
exit    (\q)    Exit mysql. Same as quit.
go      (\g)    Send command to mysql server.
nopager (\n)    Disable pager, print to stdout.
notee   (\t)    Don't write into outfile.
pager   (\P)    Set PAGER [to_pager]. Print the query results via PAGER.
print   (\p)    Print current command.
quit    (\q)    Quit mysql.
rehash  (\#)    Rebuild completion hash.
source  (\.)    Execute a SQL script file. Takes a file name as an argument.
status  (\s)    Get status information from the server.
tee     (\T)    Set outfile [to_outfile]. Append everything into given outfile.
use     (\u)    Use another database. Takes database name as argument.
</PRE>

<P>
From the above, pager only works in UNIX.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX749"></A>
The <CODE>status</CODE> command gives you some information about the
connection and the server you are using. If you are running in the
<CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> mode, <CODE>status</CODE> will also print the values for
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> variables that affect your queries.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX750"></A>
A useful startup option for beginners (introduced in MySQL
Version 3.23.11) is <CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> (or <CODE>--i-am-a-dummy</CODE> for
users that has at some time done a <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> but
forgot the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause).  When using this option, <CODE>mysql</CODE>
sends the following command to the MySQL server when opening
the connection:

</P>

<PRE>
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=#select_limit#,
    SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=#max_join_size#"
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> and <CODE>#max_join_size#</CODE> are variables that
can be set from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The effect of the above is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are not allowed to do an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement
if you don't have a key constraint in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part. One can,
however, force an <CODE>UPDATE/DELETE</CODE> by using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET not_key_column=# WHERE not_key_column=# LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

All big results are automatically limited to <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> rows.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE>'s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>#max_join_size</CODE> row combinations will be aborted.
</UL>

<P>
Some useful hints about the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client:

</P>
<P>
Some data is much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of
the usual horizontal box type output. For example longer text, which
includes new lines, is often much easier to be read with vertical
output.

For logging, you can use the <CODE>tee</CODE> option. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be
started with option <CODE>--tee=...</CODE>, or from the command line
interactively with command <CODE>tee</CODE>. All the data displayed on the
screen will also be appended into a given file. This can be very useful
for debugging purposes also. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be disabled from the
command line with command <CODE>notee</CODE>. Executing <CODE>tee</CODE> again
starts logging again. Without a parameter the previous file will be
used. Note that <CODE>tee</CODE> will flush the results into the file after
each command, just before the command line appears again waiting for the
next command.

<LI>

Browsing, or searching the results in the interactive mode in UNIX less,
more, or any other similar program, is now possible with option
<CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>. Without argument, <CODE>mysql</CODE> client will look
for environment variable PAGER and set <CODE>pager</CODE> to that.
<CODE>pager</CODE> can be started from the interactive command line with
command <CODE>pager</CODE> and disabled with command <CODE>nopager</CODE>.  The
command takes an argument optionally and the <CODE>pager</CODE> will be set to
that. Command <CODE>pager</CODE> can be called without an argument, but this
requires that the option <CODE>--pager</CODE> was used, or the <CODE>pager</CODE>
will default to stdout. <CODE>pager</CODE> works only in UNIX, since it uses
the popen() function, which doesn't exist in Windows. In Windows, the
<CODE>tee</CODE> option can be used instead, although it may not be as handy
as <CODE>pager</CODE> can be in some situations.

<LI>

A few tips about <CODE>pager</CODE>: You can use it to write to a file:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat &#62; /tmp/log.txt
</PRE>

and the results will only go to a file. You can also pass any options
for the programs that you want to use with the <CODE>pager</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager less -n -i -S
</PRE>

From the above do note the option '-S'. You may find it very useful when
browsing the results; try the option with horizontal output (end
commands with '\g', or ';') and with vertical output (end commands with
'\G'). Sometimes a very wide result set is hard to be read from the screen,
with option -S to less you can browse the results within the interactive
less from left to right, preventing lines longer than your screen from
being continued to the next line. This can make the result set much more
readable. You can swith the mode between on and off within the interactive
less with '-S'. See the 'h' for more help about less.

<LI>

Last (unless you already understood this from the above examples ;) you
can combine very complex ways to handle the results, for example the
following would send the results to two files in two different
directories, on two different hard-disks mounted on /dr1 and /dr2, yet
let the results still be seen on the screen via less:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt | tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
</PRE>

<LI>

You can also combine the two functions above; have the <CODE>tee</CODE>
enabled, <CODE>pager</CODE> set to 'less' and you will be able to browse the
results in unix 'less' and still have everything appended into a file
the same time. The difference between <CODE>UNIX tee</CODE> used with the
<CODE>pager</CODE> and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client in-built <CODE>tee</CODE>, is that
the in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> works even if you don't have the <CODE>UNIX tee</CODE>
available. The in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> also logs everything that is printed
on the screen, where the <CODE>UNIX tee</CODE> used with <CODE>pager</CODE> doesn't
log quite that much. Last, but not least, the interactive <CODE>tee</CODE> is
more handy to switch on and off, when you want to log something into a
file, but want to be able to turn the feature off sometimes.

<H3><A NAME="Using_mysqlcheck" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_mysqlcheck">4.8.4  Using <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Since MySQL version 3.23.38 you will be able to use a new
checking and repairing tool for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. The difference to
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is that <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> should be used when the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is running, where as <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> should be used
when it is not. The benefit is that you no longer have to take the
server down for checking or repairing your tables.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> uses MySQL server commands <CODE>CHECK</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> and <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> in a convenient way
for the user.

</P>
<P>
There are three alternative ways to invoke <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] database [tables]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --all-databases
</PRE>

<P>
So it can be used in a similar way as <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> when it
comes to what databases and tables you want to choose.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> does have a special feature compared to the other
clients; the default behavior, checking tables (-c), can be changed by
renaming the binary. So if you want to have a tool that repairs tables
by default, you should just copy <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> to your harddrive
with a new name, <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>, or alternatively make a symbolic
link to <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> and name the symbolic link as
<CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>. If you invoke <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> now, it will repair
tables by default.

</P>
<P>
The names that you can use to change <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> default behavior
are here:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqlrepair:   The default option will be -r
mysqlanalyze:  The default option will be -a
mysqloptimize: The default option will be -o
</PRE>

<P>
The options available for <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> are listed here, please
check what your version supports with <CODE>mysqlcheck --help</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A, --all-databases</CODE>
<DD>
Check all the databases. This will be same as --databases with all
databases selected
<DT><CODE>-1, --all-in-1</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of making one query for each table, execute all queries in 1
query separately for each database. Table names will be in a comma
separated list.
<DT><CODE>-a, --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyze given tables.
<DT><CODE>--auto-repair</CODE>
<DD>
If a checked table is corrupted, automatically fix it. Repairing will be
done after all tables have been checked, if corrupted ones were found.
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=...</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. Often this is 'd:t:o,filename'
<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are
<DT><CODE>-c, --check</CODE>
<DD>
Check table for errors
<DT><CODE>-C, --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since last check or haven't been
closed properly.
<DT><CODE>--compress</CODE>
<DD>
Use compression in server/client protocol.
<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display this help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To check several databases. Note the difference in usage; In this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=...</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set
<DT><CODE>-F, --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that hasn't been closed properly
<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get an sql-error.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it will ensure that the
table is 100 percent consistent, but will take a long time.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will run an extended
repair on the table, which may not only take a long time to execute, but
may produce a lot of garbage rows also!
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=...</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to host.
<DT><CODE>-m, --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99 percent of all
errors. Should be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-o, --optimize</CODE>
<DD>
Optimize table
<DT><CODE>-p, --password[=...]</CODE>
<DD>
Password to use when connecting to server. If password is not given
it's solicited on the tty.
<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to use for connection.
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it prevents the check
from scanning the rows to check for wrong links. This is the fastest
check.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will try to repair
only the index tree. This is the fastest repair method for a table.
<DT><CODE>-r, --repair</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique.
<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Print only error messages.
<DT><CODE>-S, --socket=...</CODE>
<DD>
Socket file to use for connection.
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-u, --user=#</CODE>
<DD>
User for login if not current user.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Print info about the various stages.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.

Add <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> before and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLE</CODE> after each table dump.
(To get faster inserts into MySQL.)
<DT><CODE>--add-drop-table</CODE>
<DD>
Add a <CODE>drop table</CODE> before each create statement.
<DT><CODE>-A, --all-databases</CODE>
<DD>
Dump all the databases. This will be same as <CODE>--databases</CODE> with all
databases selected.
<DT><CODE>-a, --all</CODE>
<DD>
Include all MySQL-specific create options.
<DT><CODE>--allow-keywords</CODE>
<DD>
Allow creation of column names that are keywords.  This works by
prefixing each column name with the table name.
<DT><CODE>-c, --complete-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use complete insert statements (with column names).
<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>
<DD>
Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To dump several databases. Note the difference in usage. In this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<CODE>USE db_name;</CODE> will be included in the output before each new database.
<DT><CODE>--delayed</CODE>
<DD>
Insert rows with the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> command.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use the new multiline <CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax. (Gives more compact and
faster inserts statements.)
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-escaped-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--lines-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
These options are used with the <CODE>-T</CODE> option and have the same
meaning as the corresponding clauses for <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<DT><CODE>-F, --flush-logs</CODE>
<DD>
Flush log file in the MySQL server before starting the dump.
<DT><CODE>-f, --force,</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get a SQL error during a table dump.
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=..</CODE>
<DD>
Dump data from the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables.</CODE>
<DD>
Lock all tables before starting the dump.  The tables are locked with
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> to allow concurrent inserts in the case of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.
<DT><CODE>-n, --no-create-db</CODE>
<DD>
'CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ db_name;' will not be put in the
output. The above line will be added otherwise, if --databases or
--all-databases option was given.
<DT><CODE>-t, --no-create-info</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write table creation information (The <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.)
<DT><CODE>-d, --no-data</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write any row information for the table.  This is very useful if you
just want to get a dump of the structure for a table!
<DT><CODE>--opt</CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>--quick --add-drop-table --add-locks --extended-insert
--lock-tables</CODE>.  Should give you the fastest possible dump for reading
into a MySQL server.
<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.
<DT><CODE>-P port_num, --port=port_num</CODE>
<DD>
The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a host.  (This is used for
connections to hosts other than <CODE>localhost</CODE>, for which Unix sockets are
used.)
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Don't buffer query, dump directly to stdout. Uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to do this.
<DT><CODE>-r, --result-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
Direct output to a given file. This option should be used in MSDOS,
because it prevents new line '\n' from being converted to '\n\r' (new
line + carriage return).
<DT><CODE>-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
The socket file to use when connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the
default host).
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-T, --tab=path-to-some-directory</CODE>
<DD>
Creates a <CODE>table_name.sql</CODE> file, that contains the SQL CREATE commands,
and a <CODE>table_name.txt</CODE> file, that contains the data, for each give table.
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: This only works if <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is run on the same
machine as the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon.  The format of the <CODE>.txt</CODE> file
is made according to the <CODE>--fields-xxx</CODE> and <CODE>--lines--xxx</CODE> options.
<DT><CODE>-u user_name, --user=user_name</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
default value is your Unix login name.
<DT><CODE>-O var=option, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables are listed below.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print out more information on what the program does.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print version information and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w, --where='where-condition'</CODE>
<DD>
Dump only selected records. Note that QUOTES are mandatory:


<PRE>
"--where=user='jimf'" "-wuserid&#62;1" "-wuserid&#60;1"
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>-O net_buffer_length=#, where # &#60; 16M</CODE>
<DD>
When creating multi-row-insert statements (as with option
<CODE>--extended-insert</CODE> or <CODE>--opt</CODE>), <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create
rows up to <CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> length. If you increase this
variable, you should also ensure that the <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>
variable in the MySQL server is bigger than the
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The most normal use of <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is probably for making a backup of
whole databases. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database &#62; backup-file.sql

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -e "source /patch-to-backup/backup-file.sql" database

However, it's also very useful to populate another MySQL server with
information from a database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database | mysql --host=remote-host -C database

</PRE>

<P>
For each text file named on the command line,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> strips any extension from the filename and uses the result
to determine which table to import the file's contents into.  For example,
files named <TT>`patient.txt'</TT>, <TT>`patient.text'</TT>, and <TT>`patient'</TT> would
all be imported into a table named <CODE>patient</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c, --columns=...</CODE>
<DD>
This option takes a comma-separated list of field names as an argument.
The field list is used to create a proper <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command,
which is then passed to MySQL. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>

Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).

<DT><CODE>-d, --delete</CODE>

<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore errors.  For example, if a table for a text file doesn't exist,
continue processing any remaining files.  Without <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> exits if a table doesn't exist.

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>-h host_name, --host=host_name</CODE>
<DD>
Import data to the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-i, --ignore</CODE>
<DD>
See the description for the <CODE>--replace</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Lock <STRONG>ALL</STRONG> tables for writing before processing any text files. This
ensures that all tables are synchronized on the server.

<DT><CODE>-L, --local</CODE>
<DD>
Read input files from the client.  By default, text files are assumed to be on
the server if you connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the default host).

<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.

<DT><CODE>-P port_num, --port=port_num</CODE>
<DD>
The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a host.  (This is used for
connections to hosts other than <CODE>localhost</CODE>, for which Unix sockets are
used.)

<DT><CODE>-r, --replace</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>--replace</CODE> and <CODE>--ignore</CODE> options control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
<CODE>--replace</CODE>, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify <CODE>--ignore</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text
file is ignored.

<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

<DT><CODE>-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
The socket file to use when connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the
default host).

</TABLE>

<P>
All logs can be found in the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.  You can
force <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to reopen the log files (or in some cases
switch to a new log) by executing <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Error_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes all errors to the stderr, which the
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script redirects to a file called
<CODE>'hostname'.err</CODE>.  (On Windows, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes this directly
to <TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT>).

</P>
<P>
This contains information indicating when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was started and
stopped and also any critical errors found when running.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
dies unexpectedly and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> needs to restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will write a <CODE>restarted mysqld</CODE> row in this
file.  This log also holds a warning if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> notices a table
that needs to be automatically checked or repaired.

</P>
<P>
On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace
for where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. This can be used to find out where
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_stack_trace">G.1.4  Using a stack trace</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX787"></A>
<A NAME="IDX788"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you want to know what happens within <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should start
it with <CODE>--log[=file]</CODE>.  This will log all connections and queries
to the log file (by default named <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT>).  This log can
be very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know
exactly what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> thought the client sent to it.

</P>
<P>
By default, the <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script starts the MySQL
server with the <CODE>-l</CODE> option.  If you need better performance when
you start using MySQL in a production environment, you can
remove the <CODE>-l</CODE> option from <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> or change it to
<CODE>--log-bin</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The entries in this log are written as <CODE>mysqld</CODE> receives the questions.
This may be different than the order in which the statements are executed.
This is in contrast to the update log and the binary log which are written
after the query is executed, but before any locks are released.

with the update log.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-update[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update
data. If no filename is given, it defaults to the name of the host
machine. If a filename is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the file
is written in the data directory. If <TT>`file_name'</TT> doesn't have an
extension, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will create log file names like so:
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>, where <CODE>###</CODE> is a number that is incremented each
time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> statement, or restart the server.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> For the above scheme to work, you should NOT create
your own files with the same filename as the update log + some extensions
that may be regarded as a number, in the directory used by the update log!

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>--log</CODE> or <CODE>-l</CODE> options, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a
general log with a filename of <TT>`hostname.log'</TT>, and restarts and
refreshes do not cause a new log file to be generated (although it is closed
and reopened). In this case you can copy it (on Unix) by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
mv hostname.log hostname-old.log
mysqladmin flush-logs
cp hostname-old.log to-backup-directory
rm hostname-old.log
</PRE>

<P>
Update logging is smart because it logs only statements that really update
data. So an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> that finds no
rows is not written to the log. It even skips <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that
set a column to the value it already has.

</P>
<P>
The update logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
If you want to update a database from update log files, you could do the
following (assuming your update logs have names of the form
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ls -1 -t -r file_name.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ls</CODE> is used to get all the log files in the right order.

</P>
<P>
This can be useful if you have to revert to backup files after a crash
and you want to redo the updates that occurred between the time of the backup
and the crash.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Binary_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX791"></A>
<A NAME="IDX792"></A>

</P>
<P>
The intention is that the binary log should replace the update log, so
we recommend you to switch to this log format as soon as possible!

</P>
<P>
The binary log contains all information that is available in the update
log in a more efficient format. It also contains information about how long
every query that updated the database took.

</P>
<P>
The binary log is also used when you are replicating a slave from a master.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-bin[=file_name]</CODE> option, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no
file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine followed
by <CODE>-bin</CODE>. If file name is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the
file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
If you supply an extension to <CODE>--log-bin=filename.extension</CODE>, the
extension will be silenty removed.

</P>
<P>
To the binary log filename <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will append an extension that is a
number that is incremented each time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin
refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>
statement or restart the server. 

</P>
<P>
You can use the following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to affect what is logged
to the binary log:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master it should log updates for the specified database, and
exclude all others not explicitly mentioned.
(Example: <CODE>binlog-do-db=some_database</CODE>)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that updates to the given database should not be logged
to the binary log (Example: <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=some_database</CODE>)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To be able to know which different binary log files have been used,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will also create a binary log index file that
contains the name of all used binary log files. By default this has the
same name as the binary log file, with the extension <CODE>'.index'</CODE>.
You can change the name of the binary log index file with the
<CODE>--log-bin-index=[filename]</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files until you are sure that no slave will ever need to use them.
One way to do this is to do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> once a day and then
remove any logs that are more than 3 days old.

</P>
<P>
You can examine the binary log file with the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> command.
For example, you can update a MySQL server from the binary log
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqlbinlog log-file | mysql -h server_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> program to read the binary log
directly from a remote MySQL server!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlbinlog --help</CODE> will give you more information of how to use
this program!

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>BEGIN [WORK]</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you must
use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the old update log.

</P>
<P>
The binary logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
All updates (<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>INSERT</CODE>) that change
a transactional table (like BDB tables) are cached until a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>.
Any updates to a non-transactional table are stored in the binary log at
once.  Every thread will, on start, allocate a buffer of
<CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE> to buffer queries.  If a query is bigger than
this, the thread will open a temporary file to handle the bigger cache.
The temporary file will be deleted when the thread ends.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE> can be used to restrict the total size used
to cache a multi-transaction query.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the update or binary log, concurrent inserts will
not work together with <CODE>CREATE ... INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE>.
This is to ensure that you can recreate an exact copy of your tables by
applying the log on a backup.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that took
more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> to execute. The time to get the initial
table locks are not counted as execution time.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log is logged after the query is executed and after all
locks has been released. This may be different than the order in which
the statements are executed.

</P>
<P>
If no file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine
suffixed with <CODE>-slow.log</CODE>. If a filename is given, but doesn't
contain a path, the file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to
execute and are thus candidates for optimization. With a large log, that
can become a difficult task. You can pipe the slow query log through the
<CODE>mysqldumpslow</CODE> command to get a summary of the queries which
appear in the log.

</P>
<P>
You are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that are not
using indexes are printed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  mysqld Command-line Options</A>.

<P>
MySQL has a lot of log files which make it easy to see what is
going. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Log_Files">4.9  The MySQL Log Files</A>. One must however from time to time clean up
after <CODE>MysQL</CODE> to ensure that the logs don't take up too much disk
space.

</P>
<P>
When using MySQL with log files, you will, from time to time,
want to remove/backup old log files and tell MySQL to start
logging on new files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>
<P>
On a Linux (<CODE>Redhat</CODE>) installation, you can use the
<CODE>mysql-log-rotate</CODE> script for this. If you installed MySQL
from an RPM distribution, the script should have been installed
automatically.  Note that you should be careful with this if you are using
the log for replication!

</P>
<P>
On other systems you must install a short script yourself that you
start from <CODE>cron</CODE> to handle log files.

</P>
<P>
You can force MySQL to start using new log files by using
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> or by using the SQL command <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>.
If you are using MySQL Version 3.21 you must use <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The above command does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If standard logging (<CODE>--log</CODE>) or slow query logging
(<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>) is used, closes and reopens the log file.
(<TT>`mysql.log'</TT> and <TT>``hostname`-slow.log'</TT> as default).
<LI>

If update logging (<CODE>--log-update</CODE>) is used, closes the update log and
opens a new log file with a higher sequence number.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using only an update log, you only have to flush the logs and then
move away the old update log files to a backup.
If you are using the normal logging, you can do something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql-data-directory
shell&#62; mv mysql.log mysql.old
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-logs
</PRE>

<P>
and then take a backup and remove <TT>`mysql.old'</TT>.

This chapter describes the various replication features in MySQL.
It serves as a reference to the options available with replication.
You will be introduced to replication and learn how to implement it.  
Towards the end, there are some frequently asked questions and descriptions 
of problems and how to solve them.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Intro" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
One way replication can be used is to increase both robustness and
speed. For robustness you can have two systems and can switch to the backup if
you have problems with the master. The extra speed is achieved by
sending a part of the non-updating queries to the replica server. Of
course this only works if non-updating queries dominate, but that is the
normal case.

</P>
<P>
Starting in Version 3.23.15, MySQL supports one-way replication
internally. One server acts as the master, while the other acts as the
slave. Note that one server could play the roles of master in one pair
and slave in the other. The master server keeps a binary log of updates
(See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.) and an index file to binary logs to keep track of
log rotation.  The slave, upon connecting, informs the master where it
left off since the last successfully propagated update, catches up on
the updates, and then blocks and waits for the master to notify it of
the new updates.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are replicating a database, all updates to this
database should be done through the master!

</P>
<P>
Another benefit of using replication is that one can get live backups of
the system by doing a backup on a slave instead of doing it on the
master. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Implementation">4.10.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX802"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL replication is based on the server keeping track of all
changes to your database (updates, deletes, etc) in the binary
log. (See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.) and the slave server(s) reading the saved
queries from the master server's binary log so that the slave can
execute the same queries on its copy of the data.

</P>
<P>
It is <STRONG>very important</STRONG> to realize that the binary log is simply a
record starting from a fixed point in time (the moment you enable binary
logging). Any slaves which you set up will need copies of all the data
from your master as it existed the moment that you enabled binary
logging on the master. If you start your slaves with data that doesn't
agree with what was on the master <STRONG>when the binary log was
started</STRONG>, your slaves may fail.

</P>
<P>
A future version (4.0) of MySQL will remove the need to keep a
(possibly large) snapshot of data for new slaves that you might wish to
set up through the live backup functionality with no locking required.
However, at this time, it is necessary to block all writes either with a
global read lock or by shutting down the master while taking a snapshot.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is properly configured and running, it will simply connect
to the master and wait for updates to process. If the master goes away
or the slave loses connectivity with your master, it will keep trying to
connect every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds until it is able to
reconnect and resume listening for updates.

</P>
<P>
Each slave keeps track of where it left off. The master server has no
knowledge of how many slaves there are or which ones are up-to-date at
any given time.

</P>
<P>
The next section explains the master/slave setup process in more detail.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_HOWTO" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_HOWTO">4.10.3  How To Set Up Replication</A></H3>

<P>
Below is a quick description of how to set up complete replication on
your current MySQL server. It assumes you want to replicate all
your databases and have not configured replication before. You will need
to shutdown your master server briefly to complete the steps outlined
below.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure you have a recent version of MySQL installed on the master
and slave(s).

Use Version 3.23.29 or higher. Previous releases used a different binary
log format and had bugs which have been fixed in newer releases. Please,
do not report bugs until you have verified that the problem is present
in the latest release.

<LI>

Set up special a replication user on the master with the <CODE>FILE</CODE>
privilege and permission to connect from all the slaves. If the user is
only doing replication (which is recommended), you don't need to grant any
additional privileges.

For example, to create a user named <CODE>repl</CODE> which can access your
master from any host, you might use this command:


<PRE>
GRANT FILE ON *.* TO repl@"%" IDENTIFIED BY '&#60;password&#62;';
</PRE>

<LI>

Shut down MySQL on the master.


<PRE>
mysqladmin -u root -p&#60;password&#62; shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

Snapshot all the data on your master server.

The easiest way to do this (on Unix) is to simply use <STRONG>tar</STRONG> to
produce an archive of your entire data directory. The exact data
directory location depends on your installation.


<PRE>
tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar /path/to/data-dir
</PRE>

Windows users can use WinZip or similar software to create an archive of
the data directory.

<LI>

In <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> on the master add <CODE>log-bin</CODE> and
<CODE>server-id=unique number</CODE> to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section and
restart it. It is very important that the id of the slave is different from
the id of the master. Think of <CODE>server-id</CODE> as something similar
to the IP address - it uniquely identifies the server instance in the
community of replication partners.


<PRE>
[mysqld]
log-bin
server-id=1
</PRE>

<LI>

Restart MySQL on the master.

<LI>

Add the following to <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> on the slave(s):


<PRE>
master-host=&#60;hostname of the master&#62;
master-user=&#60;replication user name&#62;
master-password=&#60;replication user password&#62;
master-port=&#60;TCP/IP port for master&#62;
server-id=&#60;some unique number between 2 and 2^32-1&#62;
</PRE>

replacing the values in &#60;&#62; with what is relevant to your system.

<CODE>server-id</CODE> must be different for each server participating in
replication.  If you don't specify a server-id, it will be set to 1 if
you have not defined <CODE>master-host</CODE>, else it will be set to 2. Note
that in the case of <CODE>server-id</CODE> omission the master will refuse
connections from all slaves, and the slave will refuse to connect to a
master. Thus, omitting <CODE>server-id</CODE> is only good for backup with a
binary log.

<LI>

Copy the snapshot data into your data directory on your slave(s). Make
sure that the privileges on the files and directories are correct. The
user which MySQL runs as needs to be able to read and write to
them, just as on the master.

<LI>Restart the slave(s).

</OL>

<P>
After you have done the above, the slave(s) should connect to the master
and catch up on any updates which happened since the snapshot was taken.

</P>
<P>
If you have forgotten to set <CODE>server-id</CODE> for the slave you will get
the following error in the error log file:

</P>

<PRE>
Warning: one should set server_id to a non-0 value if master_host is set.
The server will not act as a slave.
</PRE>

<P>
If you have forgot to do this for the master, the slaves will not be
able to connect to the master.

</P>
<P>
If a slave is not able to replicate for any reason, you will find error
messages in the error log on the slave.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is replicating, you will find a file called
<CODE>master.info</CODE> in the same directory as your error log. The
<CODE>master.info</CODE> file is used by the slave to keep track of how much
of the master's binary log is has processed. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> remove or
edit the file, unless you really know what you are doing. Even in that case,
it is preferred that you use <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Features" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Features">4.10.4  Replication Features and Known Problems</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX803"></A>
<A NAME="IDX804"></A>
<A NAME="IDX805"></A>

</P>
<P>
Below is an explanation of what is supported and what is not:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Replication will be done correctly with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values.
<LI>

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> in updates does not replicate properly. Use
<CODE>RAND(some_non_rand_expr)</CODE> if you are replicating updates with
<CODE>RAND()</CODE>. You can, for example, use <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> for the
argument to <CODE>RAND()</CODE>.
<LI>

You have to use the same character set (<CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>)
on the master and the slave. If not, you may get duplicate key errors on
the slave, because a key that is regarded as unique on the master may
not be that in the other character set.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> will be handled properly as long as the file
still resides on the master server at the time of update
propagation. <CODE>LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE</CODE> will be skipped.
<LI>

Update queries that use user variables are not replication-safe (yet).
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH</CODE> commands are not stored in the binary log and are because
of this not replicated to the slaves. This is not normally a problem as
<CODE>FLUSH</CODE> doesn't change anything. This does however mean that if you
update the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> privilege tables directly without using
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement and you replicate the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> privilege
database, you must do a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> on your slaves to put
the new privileges into effect.
<LI>

Temporary tables starting in 3.23.29 are replicated properly with the
exception of the case when you shut down slave server ( not just slave thread),
you have some temporary tables open, and the are used in subsequent updates.
To deal with this problem, to shut down the slave, do <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE>, then
check <CODE>Slave_open_temp_tables</CODE> variable to see if it is 0, then issue
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>. If the number is not 0, restart the slave thread
with <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> and see
if you have better luck next time. There will be a cleaner solution, but it
has to wait until version 4.0.
In earlier versions temporary tables are not being replicated properly - we
recommend that you either upgrade, or execute <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE> on
your clients before all queries with temp tables.
<LI>

MySQL only supports one master and many slaves. We will in 4.x
add a voting algorithm to automatically change master if something goes
wrong with the current master. We will also introduce 'agent' processes
to help doing load balancing by sending select queries to different
slaves.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.26, it is safe to connect servers in a circular
master-slave relationship with <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> enabled.
Note, however, that many queries will not work right in this kind of
setup unless your client code is written to take care of the potential
problems that can happen from updates that occur in different sequence
on different servers.

This means that you can do a setup like the following:


<PRE>
A -&#62; B -&#62; C -&#62; A
</PRE>

This setup will only works if you only do non conflicting updates
between the tables.  In other words, if you insert data in A and C, you
should never insert a row in A that may have a conflicting key with a
row insert in C.  You should also not update the sam rows on two servers
if the order in which the updates are applied matters.

Note that the log format has changed in Version 3.23.26 so that
pre-3.23.26 slaves will not be able to read it.
<LI>

If the query on the slave gets an error, the slave thread will
terminate, and a message will appear in the <CODE>.err</CODE> file. You should
then connect to the slave manually, fix the cause of the error (for
example, non-existent table), and then run <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> sql
command (available starting in Version 3.23.16). In Version 3.23.15, you
will have to restart the server.
<LI>

If connection to the master is lost, the slave will retry immediately,
and then in case of failure every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> (default
60) seconds. Because of this, it is safe to shut down the master, and
then restart it after a while. The slave will also be able to deal with
network connectivity outages.
<LI>

Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track of
where it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems, especially
if disk cache was not synced before the system died. Your system fault
tolerance will be greatly increased if you have a good UPS.
<LI>

If the master is listening on a non-standard port, you will also need to
specify this with <CODE>master-port</CODE> parameter in <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> .
<LI>

In Version 3.23.15, all of the tables and databases will be
replicated. Starting in Version 3.23.16, you can restrict replication to
a set of databases with <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE> directives in
<CODE>my.cnf</CODE> or just exclude a set of databases with
<CODE>replicate-ignore-db</CODE>. Note that up until Version 3.23.23, there was a bug
that did not properly deal with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> if you did it in
a database that was excluded from replication.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.16, <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 0</CODE> will turn off
replication (binary) logging on the master, and <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN =
1</CODE> will turn in back on - you must have the process privilege to do
this.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.19, you can clean up stale replication leftovers when
something goes wrong and you want a clean start with <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>
and <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> commands. In Version 3.23.26 we have renamed them to
<CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> respectively to clarify
what they do. The old <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> variants still work, though, for
compatibility.

<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.21, you can use <CODE>LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER</CODE> for
network backup and to set up replication initially. We have recently
received a number of bug reports concerning it that we are investigating, so
we recommend that you use it only in testing until we make it more stable.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.23, you can change masters and adjust log position
with <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.23, you tell the master that updates in certain
databases should not be logged to the binary log with <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE>.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.26, you can use <CODE>replicate-rewrite-db</CODE> to tell
the slave to apply updates from one database on the master to the one
with a different name on the slave.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.28, you can use <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'log-name'</CODE>
to get rid of old logs while the slave is running.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Options">4.10.5  Replication Options in my.cnf</A></H3>

If you are using replication, we recommend you to use MySQL Version
3.23.30 or later. Older versions work, but they do have some bugs and are
missing some features.

</P>
<P>
On both master and slave you need to use the <CODE>server-id</CODE> option.
This sets an unique replication id. You should pick a unique value in the
range between 1 to 2^32-1 for each master and slave.
Example: <CODE>server-id=3</CODE>

Write to a binary update log to the specified location. Note that if you
give it a parameter with an extension (for example,
<CODE>log-bin=/mysql/logs/replication.log</CODE> ) versions up to 3.23.24 will
not work right during replication if you do <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> . The
problem is fixed in Version 3.23.25. If you are using this kind of log
name, <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> will be ignored on binlog. To clear the log, run
<CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>, and do not forget to run <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> on all
slaves. In Version 3.23.26 and in later versions you should use
<CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>log-bin-index=filename</CODE> </TD><TD>
Because the user could issue the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> command, we need to
know which log is currently active and which ones have been rotated out
and in what sequence. This information is stored in the binary log index file.
The default is `hostname`.index. You can use this option if you want to
be a rebel.

Example: <CODE>log-bin-index=db.index</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>sql-bin-update-same</CODE> </TD><TD>
If set, setting <CODE>SQL_LOG_BIN</CODE> to a value will automatically set
<CODE>SQL_LOG_UPDATE</CODE> to the same value and vice versa.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that it should log updates to the binary log if the
current database is 'database_name'. All others database are ignored.
Note that if you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in
the current database.

Example: <CODE>binlog-do-db=some_database</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that updates where the current database is
'database_name' should not be stored in the binary log.  Note that if
you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in the current
database.

Example: <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=some_database</CODE>

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-host=host</CODE> </TD><TD>
Master hostname or IP address for replication. If not set, the slave
thread will not be started.

Example: <CODE>master-host=db-master.mycompany.com</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-user=username</CODE> </TD><TD>
The user the slave thread will us for authentication when connecting to
the master. The user must have <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege. If the master user
is not set, user <CODE>test</CODE> is assumed.

Example: <CODE>master-user=scott</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-password=password</CODE> </TD><TD>
The password the slave thread will authenticate with when connecting to
the master. If not set, an empty password is assumed.

Example: <CODE>master-password=tiger</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-port=portnumber</CODE> </TD><TD>
The port the master is listening on. If not set, the compiled setting of
<CODE>MYSQL_PORT</CODE> is assumed. If you have not tinkered with
<CODE>configure</CODE> options, this should be 3306.

Example: <CODE>master-port=3306</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-connect-retry=seconds</CODE> </TD><TD>
The number of seconds the slave thread will sleep before retrying to
connect to the master in case the master goes down or the connection is
lost.  Default is 60. 

Example: <CODE>master-connect-retry=60</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-info-file=filename</CODE> </TD><TD>
The location of the file that remembers where we left off on the master
during the replication process. The default is master.info in the data
directory.  Sasha: The only reason I see for ever changing the default
is the desire to be rebelious.

Example: <CODE>master-info-file=master.info</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the specified table.
To specify more than one table, use the directive multiple times, once
for each table.  This will work for cross-database updates, in
contrast to <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-do-table=some_db.some_table</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified table. To
specify more than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple times,
once for each table. This will work for cross-datbase updates,
in contrast to <CODE>replicate-ignore-db</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-ignore-table=db_name.some_table</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the tables that match
the specified wildcard pattern.  To specify more than one table, use the
directive multiple times, once for each table.  This will work for
cross-database updates.

Example: <CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will replicate only updates
to tables in all databases that start with foo and whose table names
start with bar.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables that match the
given wild card pattern. To specify more than one table to ignore, use
the directive multiple times, once for each table. This will work for
cross-database updates.

Example: <CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will not do updates
to tables in databases that start with foo and whose table names start
with bar.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified database. To
specify more than one database to ignore, use the directive multiple
times, once for each database. This option will not work if you use cross
database updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make sure
you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%</CODE>

Example: <CODE>replicate-ignore-db=some_db</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>

Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the specified
database.  To specify more than one database, use the directive multiple
times, once for each database. Note that this will only work if you do
not use cross-database queries such as <CODE>UPDATE some_db.some_table
SET foo='bar'</CODE> while having selected a different or no database. If you
need cross database updates to work, make sure you have 3.23.28 or
later, and use <CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%</CODE>

Example: <CODE>replicate-do-db=some_db</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread to the binary
log. Off by default. You will need to turn it on if you plan to
daisy-chain the slaves.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-rewrite-db=from_name-&#62;to_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Updates to a database with a different name than the original

Example: <CODE>replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name-&#62;slave_db_name</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>slave-skip-errors=err_code1,err_code2,..</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available only in 3.23.47 and later. Tells the slave thread to continue
replication when a query returns an error from the provided
list. Normally, replication will discontinue when an error is
encountered giving the user a chance to resolve the inconsistency in the
data manually. Do not use this option unless you fully understand why
you are getting the errors.  If there are no bugs in your 
replication setup and client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, you
should never get an abort with error.Indiscriminate use of this option
will result in slaves being hopelessly out of sync with the master and
you having no idea how the problem happened.

For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the error message in
your slave error log and in the output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. Full list
of error messages can be found in the source distribution in
<CODE>Docs/mysqld_error.txt</CODE>.

You can ( but should not) also use a very non-recommended value of <CODE>all</CODE>
which will ignore all error messages and keep barging along regardless.
Needless to say, if you use it, we make no promises regarding your data
integrity. Please do not complain if your data on the slave is not anywhere
close to what it is on the master in this case - you have been warned.

Example:

<CODE>slave-skip-errors=1062,1053</CODE> or <CODE>slave-skip-errors=all</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>skip-slave-start</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave server not to start the slave on the startup.  The user
can start it later with <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>slave_read_timeout=#</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of seconds to wait for more data from the master before aborting
the read.

Replication can be controlled through the SQL interface. Below is the
summary of commands:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Command</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Starts the slave thread. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Stops the slave thread. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Disables update logging if the user has process privilege.
 Ignored otherwise. (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Re-enables update logging if the user has process privilege.
 Ignored otherwise. (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Skip the next <CODE>n</CODE> events from the master. Only valid when
the slave thread is not running, otherwise, gives an error. Useful for
recovering from replication glitches.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Deletes all binary logs listed in the index file, resetting the binlog
index file to be empty. In pre-3.23.26 versions, <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE> (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Makes the slave forget its replication position in the master
logs. In pre 3.23.26 versions the command was called
<CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE>(Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>LOAD TABLE tblname FROM MASTER</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Downloads a copy of the table from master to the slave. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO master_def_list</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Changes the master parameters to the values specified in
<CODE>master_def_list</CODE> and restarts the slave thread. <CODE>master_def_list</CODE>
is a comma-separated list of <CODE>master_def</CODE> where <CODE>master_def</CODE> is
one of the following: <CODE>MASTER_HOST</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_USER</CODE>,
<CODE>MASTER_PASSWORD</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_PORT</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY</CODE>,
<CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE>. Example:


<PRE>

CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=4;

</PRE>

You only need to specify the values that need to be changed. The values that
you omit will stay the same with the exception of when you change the host or
the port. In that case, the slave will assume that since you are connecting to
a different host or a different port, the master is different. Therefore, the
old values of log and position are not applicable anymore, and will
automatically be reset to an empty string and 0, respectively (the start
values). Note that if you restart the slave, it will remember its last master.
If this is not desirable, you should delete the <TT>`master.info'</TT> file before
restarting, and the slave will read its master from <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> or the
command line. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> </TD><TD> Provides status information on the binlog of the master. (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> </TD><TD> Provides status information on essential parameters of the slave thread. (Slave)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE> </TD><TD> Only available starting in Version 3.23.28. Lists the binary logs on the master. You should use this command prior to <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO</CODE> to find out how far you should go.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'logname'</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Available starting in Version 3.23.28. Deletes all the
replication logs that are listed in the log
index as being prior to the specified log, and removed them from the
log index, so that the given log now becomes first. Example:


<PRE>
PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010'
</PRE>

This command will do nothing and fail with an error if you have an
active slave that is currently reading one of the logs you are trying to
delete. However, if you have a dormant slave, and happen to purge one of
the logs it wants to read, the slave will be unable to replicate once it
comes up.  The command is safe to run while slaves are replicating - you
do not need to stop them.

You must first check all the slaves with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> to
see which log they are on, then do a listing of the logs on the
master with <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>, find the earliest log among all
the slaves (if all the slaves are up to date, this will be the
last log on the list), backup all the logs you are about to delete
(optional) and purge up to the target log.

<H3><A NAME="Replication_FAQ" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.7  Replication FAQ</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX809"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Why do I sometimes see more than one <CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread on
the master after I have restarted the slave?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: <CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> is a continuous process that is handled by the
server in the following way:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Catch up on the updates.
<LI>

Once there are no more updates left, go into <CODE>pthread_cond_wait()</CODE>,
from which we can be awakened either by an update or a kill.
<LI>

On wake up, check the reason. If we are not supposed to die, continue
the <CODE>Binlog_dump</CODE> loop.
<LI>

If there is some fatal error, such as detecting a dead client,
terminate the loop.
</UL>

<P>
So if the slave thread stops on the slave, the corresponding
<CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread on the master will not notice it until after
at least one update to the master (or a kill), which is needed to wake
it up from <CODE>pthread_cond_wait()</CODE>.  In the meantime, the slave
could have opened another connection, which resulted in another
<CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread.

</P>
<P>
The above problem should not be present in Version 3.23.26 and later
versions.  In Version 3.23.26 we added <CODE>server-id</CODE> to each
replication server, and now all the old zombie threads are killed on the
master when a new replication thread connects from the same slave

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I rotate replication logs?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: In Version 3.23.28 you should use <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS
TO</CODE> command after determining which logs can be deleted, and optionally
backing them up first. In earlier versions the process is much more
painful, and cannot be safely done without stopping all the slaves in
the case that you plan to re-use log names. You will need to stop the
slave threads, edit the binary log index file, delete all the old logs,
restart the master, start slave threads, and then remove the old log files.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I upgrade on a hot replication setup?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: If you are upgrading  pre-3.23.26 versions, you should just
lock the master tables, let the slave catch up, then run <CODE>FLUSH
MASTER</CODE> on the master, and <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> on the slave to reset the
logs, then restart new versions of the master and the slave. Note that
the slave can stay down for some time - since the master is logging
all the updates, the slave will be able to catch up once it is up and
can connect.

</P>
<P>
After 3.23.26, we have locked the replication protocol for modifications, so
you can upgrade masters and slave on the fly to a newer 3.23 version and you
can have different versions of MySQL running on the slave and the
master, as long as they are both newer than 3.23.26. 

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX810"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What issues should I be aware of when setting up two-way
replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication currently does not support any
locking protocol between master and slave to guarantee the atomicity of
a distributed (cross-server) update. In in other words, it is possible
for client A to make an update to  co-master 1, and in the meantime,
before it propagates to co-master 2, client B could make an update to
co-master 2 that will make the update of client A work differently than
it did on co-master 1. Thus when the update of client A will make it
to co-master 2, it will produce  tables that will be different than
what you have on co-master 1, even after all the updates from co-master
2 have also propagated. So you should not co-chain two servers in a
two-way replication relationship, unless you are sure that you updates
can safely happen in any order, or unless you take care of mis-ordered
updates somehow in the client code.

</P>

<P>
You must also realize that two-way replication actually does not improve
performance very much, if at all, as far as updates are concerned. Both
servers need to do the same amount of updates each, as you would have
one server do. The only difference is that there will be a little less
lock contention, because the updates originating on another server will
be serialized in one slave thread. This benefit, though, might be
offset by network delays.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX811"></A>
<A NAME="IDX812"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to improve performance of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: You should set up one server as the master, and direct all
writes to it, and configure as many slaves as you have the money and
rackspace for, distributing the reads among the master and the slaves.
You can also start the slaves with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE>,
<CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> and <CODE>--delay-key-write-for-all-tables</CODE>
to get speed improvements for the slave.  In this case the slave will
use non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables instead of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables
to get more speed.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What should I do to prepare my client code to use
performance-enhancing replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:
If the part of your code that is responsible for database access has
been properly abstracted/modularized, converting it to run with the
replicated setup should be very smooth and easy - just change the
implementation of your database access to read from some slave or the
master, and to always write to the master. If your code does not have
this level of abstraction,
setting up a replicated system will give you an opportunity/motivation
to it clean up.
 You should start by creating a wrapper library
/module with the following functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_query()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_query()</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>safe_</CODE> means that the function will take care of handling all
the error conditions.

</P>
<P>
You should then convert your client code to use the wrapper library.
It may be a painful and scary process at first, but it will pay off in
the long run. All applications that follow the above pattern will be
able to take advantage of one-master/many slaves solution.  The
code will be a lot easier to maintain, and adding troubleshooting
options will be trivial. You will just need to modify one or two
functions, for example, to log how long each query took, or which
query, among your many thousands, gave you an error. If you have written a lot of code already,
you may want to automate the conversion task by using Monty's
<CODE>replace</CODE> utility, which comes with the standard distribution of
MySQL, or just write your own Perl script. Hopefully, your
code follows some recognizable pattern. If not, then you are probably
better off re-writing it anyway, or at least going through and manually
beating it into a pattern.

</P>
<P>
Note that, of course, you can use different names for the
functions. What is important is having unified interface for connecting
for reads, connecting for writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: When and how much can MySQL replication improve the performance
of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication is most beneficial for a system
with frequent reads and not so frequent writes. In theory, by using a
one master/many slaves setup you can scale by adding more slaves until
you either run out of network bandwidth, or your update
load grows to the point
that the master cannot handle it.

</P>
<P>
In order to determine how many slaves you can get before the added
benefits begin to level out, and how much you can improve performance
of your site, you need to know your query patterns, and empirically
 (by benchmarking) determine the relationship between the throughput
on reads (reads per second, or <CODE>max_reads</CODE>) and on writes
<CODE>max_writes</CODE>) on a typical master and a typical slave. The
example below will show you a rather simplified calculation of what you
can get with replication for our imagined system.

</P>
<P>
Let's say our system load consists of 10% writes and 90% reads, and we
have determined that <CODE>max_reads</CODE> = 1200 - 2 * <CODE>max_writes</CODE>,
or in other words, our system can do 1200 reads per second with no
writes, our average write is twice as slow as average read,
and the relationship is
linear. Let us suppose that our master and slave are of the same
capacity, and we have N slaves and 1 master. Then we have for each
server (master or slave):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 1200 - 2 * writes</CODE> (from bencmarks)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 9* writes / (N + 1) </CODE> (reads split, but writes go
to all servers)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>9*writes/(N+1) + 2 * writes = 1200</CODE>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>writes = 1200/(2 + 9/(N+1)</CODE>

</P>
<P>
So if N = 0, which means we have no replication, our system can handle
1200/11, about 109 writes per second (which means we will have 9 times
as many reads due to the nature of our application).

</P>
<P>
If N = 1, we can get up to 184 writes per second.

</P>
<P>
If N = 8, we get up to 400.

</P>
<P>
If N = 17, 480 writes.

</P>
<P>
Eventually as N approaches infinity (and our budget negative infinity),
we can get very close to 600 writes per second, increasing system
throughput about 5.5 times. However, with only 8 servers, we increased
it almost 4 times already.

</P>
<P>
Note that our computations assumed infinite network bandwidth, and
neglected several other factors that could turn out to be significant on
your system. In many cases, you may not be able to make a computation
similar to the one above that will accurately predict what will happen
on your system if you add N replication slaves. However, answering the
following questions should help you decided whether and how much, if at
all, the replication will improve the performance of your system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

What is the read/write ratio on your system?
<LI>

How much more write load can one server handle if you reduce the reads?
<LI>

How many slaves do you have bandwidth for on your network?
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to provide redundancy/high
availability?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: With the currently available features, you would have to
set up a master and a slave (or several slaves), and write a script
that will monitor the
master to see if it is up, and instruct your applications and
the slaves of the master change in case of failure. Some suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To tell a slave to change the master use the <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.
<LI>

A good way to keep your applications informed where the master is by
having a dynamic DNS entry for the master. With <STRONG>bind</STRONG> you can
use <CODE>nsupdate</CODE> to dynamically update your DNS.
<LI>

You should run your slaves with the <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option and without
<CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE>. This way the slave will be ready to become a
master as soon as you issue <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>; <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>, and
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> on the other slaves. It will also help you catch
spurious updates that may happen because of misconfiguration of the
slave (ideally, you want to configure access rights so that no client
can update the slave, except for the slave thread) combined with the
bugs in your client programs (they should never update the slave
directly).

</UL>

<P>
We are currently working on integrating an automatic master election
system into MySQL, but until it is ready, you will have to
create your own monitoring tools.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Problems">4.10.8  Troubleshooting Replication</A></H3>

<P>
If you have followed the instructions, and your replication setup is not
working, first eliminate the user error factor by checking the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Is the master logging to the binary log? Check with <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE>.
If it is, <CODE>Position</CODE> will be non-zero. If not, verify that you have
given the master <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option and have set <CODE>server-id</CODE>.
<LI>

Is the slave running? Check with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. The answer is found
in <CODE>Slave_running</CODE> column. If not, verify slave options and check the
error log for messages.
<LI>

If the slave is running, did it establish connection with the master? Do
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>, find the thread with <CODE>system user</CODE> value in
<CODE>User</CODE> column and <CODE>none</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column, and check the
<CODE>State</CODE> column. If it says <CODE>connecting to master</CODE>, verify the
privileges for the replication user on the master, master host name, your
DNS setup, whether the master is actually running, whether it is reachable
from the slave, and if all that seems ok, read the error logs.
<LI>

If the slave was running, but then stopped, look at SHOW SLAVE STATUS
output and check the error logs. It usually
happens when some query that succeeded on the master fails on the slave. This
should never happen if you have taken a proper snapshot of the master, and
never modify the data on the slave outside of the slave thread. If it does,
it is a bug, read below on how to report it.
<LI>

If a query on that succeeded on the master refuses to run on the slave, and
a full database resync ( the proper thing to do ) does not seem feasible,
try the following:

<UL>
<LI>

First see if there is some stray record in the way. Understand how it got
there, then delete it and run <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>
<LI>

If the above does not work or does not apply, try to understand if it would
be safe to make the update manually ( if needed) and then ignore the next
query from the master.
<LI>

If you have decided you can skip the next query, do
<CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START;</CODE> to skip a query that
does not use auto_increment, or last_insert_id  or
<CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=2; SLAVE START;</CODE> otherwise. The reason
auto_increment/last_insert_id queries are different is that they take
two events in the binary log of the master.

<LI>

If you are sure the slave started out perfectly in sync with the master,
and no one has updated  the tables involved outside of slave thread,
report the bug, so
you will not have to do the above tricks again.
</UL>

<LI>

Make sure you are not running into an old bug by upgrading to the most recent
version.
<LI>

If all else fails, read the error logs. If they are big,
<CODE>grep -i slave /path/to/your-log.err</CODE> on the slave. There is no
generic pattern to search for on the master, as the only errors it logs
are general system errors - if it can, it will send the error to the slave
when things go wrong.
</UL>

<P>
When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and replication
still either does not work at all or is unstable, it is time to start working
on a bug report. We need to get as much info as possible from you to be able
to track down the bug. Please do spend some time and effort preparing a good
bug report. Ideally, we would like to have a test case in the format found in
<CODE>mysql-test/t/rpl*</CODE> directory of the source tree. If you submit a test
case like that, you can expect a patch within a day or two in most cases,
although, of course, you mileage may vary depending on a number of factors.

</P>
<P>
Second best option is a just program with easily configurable connection
arguments for the master and the slave that will demonstrate the problem on our
systems. You can write one in Perl or in C, depending on which language you
know better.

</P>
<P>
If you have one of the above ways to demonstrate the bug, use
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> to prepare a bug report and send it to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>. If you have a phantom - a problem that
does occur but you cannot duplicate "at will":

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Verify that there is no user error involved. For example, if you update the
slave outside of the slave thread, the data will be out of sync, and you can
have unique key violations on updates, in which case the slave thread will
stop and wait for you to clean up the tables manually to bring them in sync.
<LI>

Run slave with <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> and <CODE>log-bin</CODE> - this will keep
a log of all updates on the slave.
<LI>

Save all evidence before resetting the replication. If we have no or only
sketchy information, it would take us a while to track down the problem. The
evidence you should collect is:

<UL>
<LI>

All binary logs on the master
<LI>

All binary log on the slave
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> on the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> on the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

Error logs on the master and on the slave
</UL>

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> to examine the binary logs. The following should
be helpful
to find the trouble query, for example:

<PRE>
mysqlbinlog -j pos_from_slave_status /path/to/log_from_slave_status | head
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Once you have collected the evidence on the phantom problem, try hard to
isolate it into a separate test case first. Then report the problem to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> with as much info as possible.

<H1><A NAME="MySQL_Optimization" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_Optimization">5  MySQL Optimization</A></H1>

<P>
Optimization is a complicated task because it ultimately requires
understanding of the whole system. While it may be possible to do some
local optimizations with small knowledge of your system or application,
the more optimal you want your system to become the more you will have
to know about it.

</P>
<P>
This chapter will try to explain and give some examples of different
ways to optimize MySQL.  Remember, however, that there are 
always some (increasingly harder) additional ways to make the system
even faster.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Optimize_Overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#Optimize_Overview">5.1  Optimization Overview</A></H2>

<P>
The most important part for getting a system fast is of course the basic
design. You also need to know what kinds of things your system will be
doing, and what your bottlenecks are.

</P>
<P>
The most common bottlenecks are:

<UL>
<LI>Disk seeks.

It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data. With modern disks in
1999, the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in
theory do about 1000 seeks a second. This time improves slowly with new
disks and is very hard to optimize for a single table. The way to
optimize this is to spread the data on more than one disk.

<LI>Disk reading/writing.

When the disk is at the correct position we need to read the data. With
modern disks in 1999, one disk delivers something like 10-20Mb/s. This
is easier to optimize than seeks because you can read in parallel from
multiple disks.

<LI>CPU cycles.

When we have the data in main memory (or if it already were
there) we need to process it to get to our result. Having small
tables compared to the memory is the most common limiting
factor. But then, with small tables speed is usually not the problem.

<LI>Memory bandwidth.

When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache the main
memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This is an uncommon bottleneck
for most systems, but one should be aware of it.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Design_Limitations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Design_Limitations">5.1.1  MySQL Design Limitations/Tradeoffs</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX813"></A>
<A NAME="IDX814"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL uses extremely fast table locking (multiple readers /
single writers) the biggest remaining problem is a mix of a steady stream of
inserts and slow selects on the same table.

</P>
<P>
We believe that for a huge number of systems the extremely fast
performance in other cases make this choice a win. This case is usually
also possible to solve by having multiple copies of the table, but it
takes more effort and hardware.

</P>
<P>
We are also working on some extensions to solve this problem for some
common application niches.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Portability" HREF="manual_toc.html#Portability">5.1.2  Portability</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX815"></A>
<A NAME="IDX816"></A>
<A NAME="IDX817"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because all SQL servers implement different parts of SQL, it takes work to
write portable SQL applications. For very simple selects/inserts it is
very easy, but the more you need the harder it gets. If you want an
application that is fast with many databases it becomes even harder!

</P>
<P>
To make a complex application portable you need to choose a number of
SQL servers that it should work with.

</P>
<P>
You can use the MySQL crash-me program/web-page
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php">http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php</a> to find functions,
types, and limits you can use with a selection of database
servers. Crash-me now tests far from everything possible, but it
is still comprehensive with about 450 things tested.

</P>
<P>
For example, you shouldn't have column names longer than 18 characters
if you want to be able to use Informix or DB2.

</P>
<P>
Both the MySQL benchmarks and crash-me programs are very
database-independent.  By taking a look at how we have handled this, you
can get a feeling for what you have to do to write your application
database-independent.  The benchmarks themselves can be found in the
<TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory in the MySQL source
distribution. They are written in Perl with DBI database interface
(which solves the access part of the problem).

</P>
<P>
See <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a> for the results
from this benchmark.

</P>
<P>
As you can see in these results, all databases have some weak points. That
is, they have different design compromises that lead to different
behavior.

</P>
<P>
If you strive for database independence, you need to get a good feeling
for each SQL server's bottlenecks. MySQL is VERY fast in
retrieving and updating things, but will have a problem in mixing slow
readers/writers on the same table. Oracle, on the other hand, has a big
problem when you try to access rows that you have recently updated
(until they are flushed to disk). Transaction databases in general are
not very good at generating summary tables from log tables, as in this
case row locking is almost useless.

</P>
<P>
To get your application <EM>really</EM> database-independent, you need to define
an easy extendable interface through which you manipulate your data. As
C++ is available on most systems, it makes sense to use a C++ classes
interface to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you use some specific feature for some database (like the
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command in MySQL), you should code a method for
the other SQL servers to implement the same feature (but slower).  With
MySQL you can use the <CODE>/*!  */</CODE> syntax to add
MySQL-specific keywords to a query.  The code inside
<CODE>/**/</CODE> will be treated as a comment (ignored) by most other SQL
servers.

</P>
<P>
If REAL high performance is more important than exactness, as in some
Web applications, a possibility is to create an application layer that
caches all results to give you even higher performance. By letting
old results 'expire' after a while, you can keep the cache reasonably
fresh.  This is quite nice in case of extremely high load, in which case
you can dynamically increase the cache and set the expire timeout higher
until things get back to normal.

</P>
<P>
In this case the table creation information should contain information
of the initial size of the cache and how often the table should normally
be refreshed.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Internal_use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Internal_use">5.1.3  What Have We Used MySQL For?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX818"></A>
<A NAME="IDX819"></A>

</P>
<P>
During MySQL initial development, the features of MySQL
were made to fit our largest customer. They handle data warehousing for a
couple of the biggest retailers in Sweden.

</P>
<P>
From all stores, we get weekly summaries of all bonus card transactions,
and we are expected to provide useful information for the store owners
to help them find how their advertisement campaigns are affecting their
customers.

</P>
<P>
The data is quite huge (about 7 million summary transactions per month),
and we have data for 4-10 years that we need to present to the users.
We got weekly requests from the customers that they want to get
'instant' access to new reports from this data.

</P>
<P>
We solved this by storing all information per month in compressed
'transaction' tables. We have a set of simple macros (script) that
generates summary tables grouped by different criteria (product group,
customer id, store ...) from the transaction tables.  The reports are
Web pages that are dynamically generated by a small Perl script that
parses a Web page, executes the SQL statements in it, and inserts the
results. We would have used PHP or mod_perl instead but they were
not available at that time.

</P>
<P>
For graphical data we wrote a simple tool in <CODE>C</CODE> that can produce
GIFs based on the result of a SQL query (with some processing of the
result). This is also dynamically executed from the Perl script that
parses the <CODE>HTML</CODE> files.

</P>
<P>
In most cases a new report can simply be done by copying an existing
script and modifying the SQL query in it.  In some cases, we will need to
add more fields to an existing summary table or generate a new one, but
this is also quite simple, as we keep all transactions tables on disk.
(Currently we have at least 50G of transactions tables and 200G of other
customer data.)

</P>
<P>
We also let our customers access the summary tables directly with ODBC
so that the advanced users can themselves experiment with the data.

</P>
<P>
We haven't had any problems handling this with quite modest Sun Ultra
SPARCstation (2x200 Mhz). We recently upgraded one of our servers to a 2
CPU 400 Mhz UltraSPARC, and we are now planning to start handling
transactions on the product level, which would mean a ten-fold increase
of data. We think we can keep up with this by just adding more disk to
our systems.

</P>
<P>
We are also experimenting with Intel-Linux to be able to get more CPU
power cheaper. Now that we have the binary portable database format (new
in Version 3.23), we will start to use this for some parts of the application.

</P>
<P>
Our initial feelings are that Linux will perform much better on
low-to-medium load and Solaris will perform better when you start to get a
high load because of extreme disk IO, but we don't yet have anything
conclusive about this. After some discussion with a Linux Kernel
developer, this might be a side effect of Linux giving so much resources
to the batch job that the interactive performance gets very low. This
makes the machine feel very slow and unresponsive while big batches are
going. Hopefully this will be better handled in future Linux Kernels.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX821"></A>

</P>
<P>
This should contain a technical description of the MySQL
benchmark suite (and <CODE>crash-me</CODE>), but that description is not
written yet. Currently, you can get a good idea of the benchmark by
looking at the code and results in the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory in any
MySQL source distributions.

</P>
<P>
This benchmark suite is meant to be a benchmark that will tell any user
what things a given SQL implementation performs well or poorly at.

</P>
<P>
Note that this benchmark is single threaded, so it measures the minimum
time for the operations. We plan to in the future add a lot of
multi-threaded tests to the benchmark suite.

<P>
Note that Oracle is not included because they asked to be removed. All
Oracle benchmarks have to be passed by Oracle! We believe that makes
Oracle benchmarks <STRONG>VERY</STRONG> biased because the above benchmarks are
supposed to show what a standard installation can do for a single

</P>
<P>
To run the benchmark suite, you have to download a MySQL source
distribution, install the perl DBI driver, the perl DBD driver for the
database you want to test and then do:

</P>

<PRE>
cd sql-bench
perl run-all-tests --server=#

</P>
<P>
You should definitely benchmark your application and database to find
out where the bottlenecks are.  By fixing it (or by replacing the
bottleneck with a 'dummy module') you can then easily identify the next
bottleneck (and so on).  Even if the overall performance for your
application is sufficient, you should at least make a plan for each
bottleneck, and decide how to solve it if someday you really need the
extra performance.

</P>
<P>
For an example of portable benchmark programs, look at the MySQL
benchmark suite. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>. You
can take any program from this suite and modify it for your needs. By doing
this, you can try different solutions to your problem and test which is really
the fastest solution for you.

</P>
<P>
It is very common that some problems only occur when the system is very
heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us when they
have a (tested) system in production and have encountered load problems. In
every one of these cases so far, it has been problems with basic design
(table scans are NOT good at high load) or OS/Library issues. Most of
this would be a <STRONG>LOT</STRONG> easier to fix if the systems were not
already in production.

</P>
<P>
To avoid problems like this, you should put some effort into benchmarking
your whole application under the worst possible load!  You can use
Super Smack for this, and it is available at:
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz</a>.

First, one thing that affects all queries: The more complex permission
system setup you have, the more overhead you get.

</P>
<P>
If you do not have any <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements done, MySQL will
optimize the permission checking somewhat. So if you have a very high
volume it may be worth the time to avoid grants. Otherwise more
permission check results in a larger overhead.

</P>
<P>
If your problem is with some explicit MySQL function, you can
always time this in the MySQL client:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select benchmark(1000000,1+1);
+------------------------+
| benchmark(1000000,1+1) |
+------------------------+
|                      0 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.32 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The above shows that MySQL can execute 1,000,000 <CODE>+</CODE>
expressions in 0.32 seconds on a <CODE>PentiumII 400MHz</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL functions should be very optimized, but there may be
some exceptions, and the <CODE>benchmark(loop_count,expression)</CODE> is a
great tool to find out if this is a problem with your query.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="EXPLAIN" HREF="manual_toc.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX828"></A>
<A NAME="IDX829"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
    EXPLAIN tbl_name
or  EXPLAIN SELECT select_options
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>EXPLAIN tbl_name</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you precede a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement with the keyword <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>,
MySQL explains how it would process the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, providing
information about how tables are joined and in which order.

</P>
<P>
With the help of <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, you can see when you must add indexes
to tables to get a faster <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that uses indexes to find the
records. You can also see if the optimizer joins the tables in an optimal
order. To force the optimizer to use a specific join order for a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, add a <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
For non-simple joins, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> returns a row of information for each
table used in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement. The tables are listed in the order
they would be read.  MySQL resolves all joins using a single-sweep
multi-join method. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first
table, then finds a matching row in the second table, then in the third table
and so on. When all tables are processed, it outputs the selected columns and
backtracks through the table list until a table is found for which there are
more matching rows. The next row is read from this table and the process
continues with the next table.

</P>
<P>
Output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> includes the following columns:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>table</CODE>
<DD>
The table to which the row of output refers.

<DT><CODE>type</CODE>
<DD>
The join type.  Information about the various types is given below.

<DT><CODE>possible_keys</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> column indicates which indexes MySQL
could use to find the rows in this table. Note that this column is
totally independent of the order of the tables. That means that some of
the keys in possible_keys may not be usable in practice with the
generated table order.

If this column is empty, there are no relevant indexes. In this case,
you may be able to improve the performance of your query by examining
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to see if it refers to some column or columns
that would be suitable for indexing.  If so, create an appropriate index
and check the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To see what indexes a table has, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>key</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates the key that MySQL actually
decided to use. The key is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if no index was chosen.  If
MySQL chooses the wrong index, you can probably force
MySQL to use another index by using <CODE>myisamchk --analyze</CODE>,
See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A>, or by using <CODE>USE INDEX/IGNORE INDEX</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>key_len</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> column indicates the length of the key that
MySQL decided to use.  The length is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the
<CODE>key</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Note that this tells us how many parts of a
multi-part key MySQL will actually use.

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column shows which columns or constants are used with the
<CODE>key</CODE> to select rows from the table.

<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>rows</CODE> column indicates the number of rows MySQL
believes it must examine to execute the query.

<DT><CODE>Extra</CODE>
<DD>
This column contains additional information of how MySQL will
resolve the query. Here is an explanation of the different text
strings that can be found in this column:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Distinct</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will not continue searching for more rows for the current row
combination after it has found the first matching row.

<DT><CODE>Not exists</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL was able to do a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> optimization on the
query and will not examine more rows in this table for the previous row
combination after it finds one row that matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> criteria.

Here is an example for this:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

Assume that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> is defined with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.  In this case
MySQL will scan <CODE>t1</CODE> and look up the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE>
through <CODE>t1.id</CODE>. If MySQL finds a matching row in
<CODE>t2</CODE>, it knows that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> can never be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, and will
not scan through the rest of the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE> that has the same
<CODE>id</CODE>.  In other words, for each row in <CODE>t1</CODE>, MySQL
only needs to do a single lookup in <CODE>t2</CODE>, independent of how many
matching rows there are in <CODE>t2</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>range checked for each record (index map: #)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
MySQL didn't find a real good index to use. It will, instead, for
each row combination in the preceding tables, do a check on which index to
use (if any), and use this index to retrieve the rows from the table.  This
isn't very fast but is faster than having to do a join without
an index.

<DT><CODE>Using filesort</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will need to do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve
the rows in sorted order.  The sort is done by going through all rows
according to the <CODE>join type</CODE> and storing the sort key + pointer to
the row for all rows that match the <CODE>WHERE</CODE>. Then the keys are
sorted. Finally the rows are retrieved in sorted order.

<DT><CODE>Using index</CODE>
<DD>
The column information is retrieved from the table using only
information in the index tree without having to do an additional seek to
read the actual row.  This can be done when all the used columns for
the table are part of the same index.

<DT><CODE>Using temporary</CODE>
<DD>
To resolve the query MySQL will need to create a
temporary table to hold the result.  This typically happens if you do an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a different column set than you did a <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on.

<DT><CODE>Where used</CODE>
<DD>
A <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be used to restrict which rows will be
matched against the next table or sent to the client.  If you don't have
this information and the table is of type <CODE>ALL</CODE> or <CODE>index</CODE>,
you may have something wrong in your query (if you don't intend to
fetch/examine all rows from the table).
</DL>

If you want to get your queries as fast as possible, you should look out for
<CODE>Using filesort</CODE> and <CODE>Using temporary</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
The different join types are listed below, ordered from best to worst type:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX830"></A>
<A NAME="IDX831"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>system</CODE>
<DD>
The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special case of
the <CODE>const</CODE> join type.

<A NAME="IDX832"></A>
<A NAME="IDX833"></A>
<DT><CODE>const</CODE>
<DD>
The table has at most one matching row, which will be read at the start
of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the column in
this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the
optimizer. <CODE>const</CODE> tables are very fast as they are read only once!

<DT><CODE>eq_ref</CODE>
<DD>
One row will be read from this table for each combination of rows from
the previous tables.  This is the best possible join type, other than the
<CODE>const</CODE> types.  It is used when all parts of an index are used by
the join and the index is <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
All rows with matching index values will be read from this table for each
combination of rows from the previous tables.  <CODE>ref</CODE> is used if the join
uses only a leftmost prefix of the key, or if the key is not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> (in other words, if the join cannot select a single
row based on the key value).  If the key that is used matches only a few rows,
this join type is good.

<DT><CODE>range</CODE>
<DD>
Only rows that are in a given range will be retrieved, using an index to
select the rows.  The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates which index is used.
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> contains the longest key part that was used.
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column will be NULL for this type.

<DT><CODE>index</CODE>
<DD>
This is the same as <CODE>ALL</CODE>, except that only the index tree is
scanned.  This is usually faster than <CODE>ALL</CODE>, as the index file is usually
smaller than the data file.

<DT><CODE>ALL</CODE>
<DD>
A full table scan will be done for each combination of rows from the
previous tables.  This is normally not good if the table is the first
table not marked <CODE>const</CODE>, and usually <STRONG>very</STRONG> bad in all other
cases. You normally can avoid <CODE>ALL</CODE> by adding more indexes, so that
the row can be retrieved based on constant values or column values from
earlier tables.
</DL>

<P>
You can get a good indication of how good a join is by multiplying all values
in the <CODE>rows</CODE> column of the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output. This should tell you
roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query. This
number is also used when you restrict queries with the <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following example shows how a <CODE>JOIN</CODE> can be optimized progressively
using the information provided by <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement shown below, that you examine
using <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
            tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
            tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
            tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
            tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
            tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
            et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
        FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
        WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
            AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
</PRE>

<P>
For this example, assume that:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The columns being compared have been declared as follows:

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>

The <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> values aren't evenly distributed.
</UL>

<P>
Initially, before any optimizations have been performed, the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
statement produces the following information:

</P>

<PRE>
table type possible_keys                key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
et    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
do    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 2135
et_1  ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
tt    ALL  AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL    NULL 3872
      range checked for each record (key map: 35)
</PRE>

<P>
Because <CODE>type</CODE> is <CODE>ALL</CODE> for each table, this output indicates that
MySQL is doing a full join for all tables!  This will take quite a
long time, as the product of the number of rows in each table must be
examined!  For the case at hand, this is <CODE>74 * 2135 * 74 * 3872 =
45,268,558,720</CODE> rows.  If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine how
long it would take.

</P>
<P>
One problem here is that MySQL can't (yet) use indexes on columns
efficiently if they are declared differently.  In this context,
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> are the same unless they are declared as
different lengths. Because <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE>
and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(15)</CODE>, there is a length
mismatch.

</P>
<P>
To fix this disparity between column lengths, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
lengthen <CODE>ActualPC</CODE> from 10 characters to 15 characters:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> are both <CODE>VARCHAR(15)</CODE>.
Executing the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> statement again produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL 3872    where used
do    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et_1  ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        74
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1
</PRE>

<P>
This is not perfect, but is much better (the product of the <CODE>rows</CODE>
values is now less by a factor of 74). This version is executed in a couple
of seconds.

</P>
<P>
A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length mismatches
for the <CODE>tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID</CODE> and <CODE>tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR</CODE> comparisons:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
                      MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces the output shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref            rows     Extra
et    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL           74
tt    ref    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC ActualPC 15 et.EMPLOYID 52 where used
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC  1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID    1
</PRE>

<P>
This is almost as good as it can get.

</P>
<P>
The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL assumes that values
in the <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> column are evenly distributed, and that isn't the
case for the <CODE>tt</CODE> table.  Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL
about this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk --analyze PATH_TO_MYSQL_DATABASE/tt
shell&#62; mysqladmin refresh
</PRE>

<P>
Now the join is perfect, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref            rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL    3872    where used
et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC    1
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC  1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID    1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>rows</CODE> column in the output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> is an
educated guess from the MySQL join optimizer. To optimize a
query, you should check if the numbers are even close to the truth.  If not,
you may get better performance by using <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in your
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement and trying to list the tables in a different order in
the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Estimating_performance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Estimating_performance">5.2.2  Estimating Query Performance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX834"></A>
<A NAME="IDX835"></A>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>

</P>
<P>
In most cases you can estimate the performance by counting disk seeks.
For small tables, you can usually find the row in 1 disk seek (as the
index is probably cached).  For bigger tables, you can estimate that
(using B++ tree indexes) you will need: <CODE>log(row_count) /
log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) +
1</CODE> seeks to find a row.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data
pointer is usually 4 bytes. A 500,000 row table with an
index length of 3 (medium integer) gives you:
<CODE>log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1</CODE> = 4 seeks.

</P>
<P>
As the above index would require about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2 = 5.2M,
(assuming that the index buffers are filled to 2/3, which is typical)
you will probably have much of the index in memory and you will probably
only need 1-2 calls to read data from the OS to find the row.

</P>
<P>
For writes, however, you will need 4 seek requests (as above) to find
where to place the new index and normally 2 seeks to update the index
and write the row.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that your application will slowly
degenerate by N log N!  As long as everything is cached by the OS or SQL
server things will only go marginally slower while the table gets
bigger. After the data gets too big to be cached, things will start to
go much slower until your applications is only bound by disk-seeks
(which increase by N log N). To avoid this, increase the index cache as
the data grows. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<P>
In general, when you want to make a slow <CODE>SELECT ... WHERE</CODE> faster, the
first thing to check is whether or not you can add an index. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>. All references between different tables
should usually be done with indexes. You can use the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
to determine which indexes are used for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
Some general tips:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To help MySQL optimize queries better, run <CODE>myisamchk
--analyze</CODE> on a table after it has been loaded with relevant data. This
updates a value for each index part that indicates the average number of
rows that have the same value.  (For unique indexes, this is always 1,
of course.).  MySQL will use this to decide which index to
choose when you connect two tables with 'a non-constant expression'.
You can check the result from the <CODE>analyze</CODE> run by doing <CODE>SHOW
INDEX FROM table_name</CODE> and examining the <CODE>Cardinality</CODE> column.

<LI>

To sort an index and data according to an index, use <CODE>myisamchk
--sort-index --sort-records=1</CODE> (if you want to sort on index 1). If you
have a unique index from which you want to read all records in order
according to that index, this is a good way to make that faster.  Note,
however, that this sorting isn't written optimally and will take a long
time for a large table!
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Where_optimizations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Where_optimizations">5.2.4  How MySQL Optimizes <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX839"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX840"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimizations are put in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part here because
they are mostly used with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, but the same optimizations apply for
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> in <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Also note that this section is incomplete. MySQL does many
optimizations, and we have not had time to document them all.

</P>
<P>
Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL are listed below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Removal of unnecessary parentheses:

<PRE>
   ((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
-&#62; (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant folding:

<PRE>
   (a&#60;b AND b=c) AND a=5
-&#62; b&#62;5 AND b=c AND a=5
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):

<PRE>
   (B&#62;=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
-&#62; B=5 OR B=6
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.
<LI>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> on a single table without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is retrieved
directly from the table information.  This is also done for any <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>
expression when used with only one table.
<LI>

Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly
detects that some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are impossible and returns no rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> is merged with <CODE>WHERE</CODE> if you don't use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
or group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>...).
<LI>

For each sub-join, a simpler <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is constructed to get a fast
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> evaluation for each sub-join and also to skip records as
soon as possible.
<A NAME="IDX841"></A>
<A NAME="IDX842"></A>
<LI>

All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the query.
A constant table is:

<UL>
<LI>

An empty table or a table with 1 row.
<LI>

A table that is used with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
index, or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, where all index parts are used with constant
expressions and the index parts are defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

All the following tables are used as constant tables:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t1,t2
           WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
</PRE>

<LI>

The best join combination to join the tables is found by trying all
possibilities. If all columns in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and in <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> come from the same table, then this table is preferred first when
joining.
<LI>

If there is an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause and a different <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
clause, or if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> contains columns
from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary
table is created.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, MySQL will use an in-memory
temporary table.
<LI>

Each table index is queried, and the best index that spans fewer than 30% of
the rows is used. If no such index can be found, a quick table scan is used.
<LI>

In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even
consulting the data file.  If all columns used from the index are numeric,
then only the index tree is used to resolve the query.
<LI>

Before each record is output, those that do not match the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause
are skipped.
</UL>

<P>
Some examples of queries that are very fast:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
           WHERE key_part_1=constant;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
           ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
           ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... LIMIT 10;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries are resolved using only the index tree (assuming
the indexed columns are numeric):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
           WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted
order without a separate sorting pass:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... ;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX844"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is converted to a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on all columns,
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> combined with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will in many cases also
need a temporary table.

</P>
<P>
When combining <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds <CODE>#</CODE> unique rows.

</P>
<P>
If you don't use columns from all used tables, MySQL will stop
the scanning of the not used tables as soon as it has found the first match.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;
</PRE>

<P>
In the case, assuming t1 is used before t2 (check with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>), then
MySQL will stop reading from t2 (for that particular row in t1)
when the first row in t2 is found.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="LEFT_JOIN_optimization" HREF="manual_toc.html#LEFT_JOIN_optimization">5.2.6  How MySQL Optimizes <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE></A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX845"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX846"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>A LEFT JOIN B</CODE> in MySQL is implemented as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table <CODE>B</CODE> is set to be dependent on table <CODE>A</CODE> and all tables
that <CODE>A</CODE> is dependent on.

<LI>

The table <CODE>A</CODE> is set to be dependent on all tables (except <CODE>B</CODE>)
that are used in the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.

<LI>

All <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> conditions are moved to the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

All standard join optimizations are done, with the exception that a table is
always read after all tables it is dependent on.  If there is a circular
dependence then MySQL will issue an error.

<LI>

All standard <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimizations are done.

<LI>

If there is a row in <CODE>A</CODE> that matches the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, but there
wasn't any row in <CODE>B</CODE> that matched the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition,
then an extra <CODE>B</CODE> row is generated with all columns set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> to find rows that don't exist in some
table and you have the following test: <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> in the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> part, where column_name is a column that is declared as
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, then MySQL will stop searching after more rows
(for a particular key combination) after it has found one row that
matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> is implemented analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The table read order forced by <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT JOIN</CODE>
will help the join optimizer (which calculates in which order tables
should be joined) to do its work much more quickly, as there are fewer
table permutations to check.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that if you do a query of type:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM a,b LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key) WHERE b.key=d.key

<UL>
<LI>

If you are selecting only a few rows with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, MySQL
will use indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a
full table scan.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, MySQL will end the
sorting as soon as it has found the first <CODE>#</CODE> lines instead of sorting
the whole table.
<LI>

When combining <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds <CODE>#</CODE> unique rows.
<LI>

In some cases a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> can be resolved by reading the key in order
(or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until the
key value changes.  In this case <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> will not calculate any
unnecessary <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>'s.
<LI>

As soon as MySQL has sent the first <CODE>#</CODE> rows to the client, it
will abort the query.
<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT 0</CODE> will always quickly return an empty set.  This is useful
to check the query and to get the column types of the result columns.
<LI>

The size of temporary tables uses the <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> to calculate how much

where the numbers are somewhat proportional to the overall time. This

(which is done once for each concurrently running query).

</P>
<P>
The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by N log N
(B-trees).

</P>
<P>
Some ways to speed up inserts:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use
multiple value lists <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements. This is much faster (many
times in some cases) than using separate <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.
<LI>

If you are inserting a lot of rows from different clients, you can get
higher speed by using the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.2  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Note that with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> you can insert rows at the same time
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are running if there are no deleted rows in the tables.
<LI>

When loading a table from a text file, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This
is usually 20 times faster than using a lot of <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

It is possible with some extra work to make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> run even
faster when the table has many indexes. Use the following procedure:


<OL>
<LI>

Optionally create the table with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. For example, using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> or Perl-DBI.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will
remove all usage of all indexes from the table.

<LI>

Insert data into the table with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This will not
update any indexes and will therefore be very fast.

<LI>

If you are going to only read the table in the future, run <CODE>myisampack</CODE>
on it to make it smaller. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compressed_format">7.1.2.3  Compressed Table Characteristics</A>.

<LI>

Re-create the indexes with <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
/path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will create the index tree in memory before
writing it to disk, which is much faster because it avoids lots of disk
seeks. The resulting index tree is also perfectly balanced.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.
</OL>

This procedure will be built into <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> in some future
version of MySQL.
<LI>

You can speed up insertions by locking your tables:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

The main speed difference is that the index buffer is flushed to disk only
once, after all <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements have completed. Normally there would
be as many index buffer flushes as there are different <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements. Locking is not needed if you can insert all rows with a single
statement.

Locking will also lower the total time of multi-connection tests, but the
maximum wait time for some threads will go up (because they wait for
locks).  For example:


<PRE>
thread 1 does 1000 inserts
thread 2, 3, and 4 does 1 insert
thread 5 does 1000 inserts
</PRE>

If you don't use locking, 2, 3, and 4 will finish before 1 and 5. If you
use locking, 2, 3, and 4 probably will not finish before 1 or 5, but the
total time should be about 40% faster.

As <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> operations are very
fast in MySQL, you will obtain better overall performance by
adding locks around everything that does more than about 5 inserts or
updates in a row.  If you do very many inserts in a row, you could do a
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> followed by an <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> once in a while
(about each 1000 rows) to allow other threads access to the table. This
would still result in a nice performance gain.

Of course, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is much faster for loading data.
</UL>

<P>
To get some more speed for both <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, enlarge the key buffer. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Update_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Update_speed">5.2.9  Speed of <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

<P>
Update queries are optimized as a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query with the additional
overhead of a write. The speed of the write is dependent on the size of
the data that is being updated and the number of indexes that are
updated.  Indexes that are not changed will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
Also, another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do
many updates in a row later. Doing many updates in a row is much quicker
than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

</P>
<P>
Note that, with dynamic record format, updating a record to
a longer total length may split the record.  So if you do this often,
it is very important to <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> sometimes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Delete_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Delete_speed">5.2.10  Speed of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE table_name</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.6  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of

Unsorted tips for faster systems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use persistent connections to the database to avoid the connection
overhead. If you can't use persistent connections and you are doing a
lot of new connections to the database, you may want to change the value
of the <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
<LI>

Always check that all your queries really use the indexes you have created
in the tables. In MySQL you can do this with the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

Try to avoid complex <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries on tables that are updated a
lot. This is to avoid problems with table locking.
<LI>

The new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables can insert rows in a table without deleted
rows at the same time another table is reading from it.  If this is important
for you, you should consider methods where you don't have to delete rows
or run <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> after you have deleted a lot of rows.
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY expr1,expr2...</CODE> if you mostly
retrieve rows in expr1,expr2.. order.  By using this option after big
changes to the table, you may be able to get higher performance.
<LI>

In some cases it may make sense to introduce a column that is 'hashed'
based on information from other columns. If this column is short and
reasonably unique it may be much faster than a big index on many
columns. In MySQL it's very easy to use this extra column:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE hash=MD5(concat(col1,col2))
AND col_1='constant' AND col_2='constant'</CODE>
<LI>

For tables that change a lot you should try to avoid all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. You will get dynamic row length as soon as you
are using a single <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

It's not normally useful to split a table into different tables just
because the rows gets 'big'. To access a row, the biggest performance
hit is the disk seek to find the first byte of the row. After finding
the data most new disks can read the whole row fast enough for most
applications. The only cases where it really matters to split up a table is if
it's a dynamic row size table (see above) that you can change to a fixed
row size, or if you very often need to scan the table and don't need
most of the columns. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

If you very often need to calculate things based on information from a
lot of rows (like counts of things), it's probably much better to
introduce a new table and update the counter in real time. An update of
type <CODE>UPDATE table set count=count+1 where index_column=constant</CODE>
is very fast!

This is really important when you use databases like MySQL that
only have table locking (multiple readers / single writers). This will
also give better performance with most databases, as the row locking
manager in this case will have less to do.
<LI>

If you need to collect statistics from big log tables, use summary tables
instead of scanning the whole table. Maintaining the summaries should be
much faster than trying to do statistics 'live'. It's much faster to
regenerate new summary tables from the logs when things change
(depending on business decisions) than to have to change the running
application!
<LI>

If possible, one should classify reports as 'live' or 'statistical',
where data needed for statistical reports are only generated based on
summary tables that are generated from the actual data.
<LI>

Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert
values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the
default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL need to do and
improves the insert speed.
<LI>

In some cases it's convenient to pack and store data into a blob. In this
case you have to add some extra code in your application to pack/unpack
things in the blob, but this may save a lot of accesses at some stage.
This is practical when you have data that doesn't conform to a static
table structure.
<LI>

Normally you should try to keep all data non-redundant (what
is called 3rd normal form in database theory), but you should not be
afraid of duplicating things or creating summary tables if you need these
to gain more speed.
<LI>

Stored procedures or UDF (user-defined functions) may be a good way to
get more performance.  In this case you should, however, always have a way
to do this some other (slower) way if you use some database that doesn't
support this.
<LI>

You can always gain something by caching queries/answers in your
application and trying to do many inserts/updates at the same time.  If
your database supports lock tables (like MySQL and Oracle),
this should help to ensure that the index cache is only flushed once
after all updates.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! DELAYED */</CODE> when you do not need to know when your
data is written. This speeds things up because many records can be written
with a single disk write.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! LOW_PRIORITY */</CODE> when you want your selects to be
more important.
<LI>

Use <CODE>SELECT /*! HIGH_PRIORITY */</CODE> to get selects that jump the
queue. That is, the select is done even if there is somebody waiting to
do a write.
<LI>

Use the multi-line <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement to store many rows with one
SQL command (many SQL servers supports this).
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to load bigger amounts of data. This is
faster than normal inserts and will be even faster when <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is integrated in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns to make unique values.
<LI>

Use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> once in a while to avoid fragmentation when
using dynamic table format. See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables to get more speed when possible. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

When using a normal Web server setup, images should be stored as
files. That is, store only a file reference in the database.  The main
reason for this is that a normal Web server is much better at caching
files than database contents. So it it's much easier to get a fast
system if you are using files.
<LI>

Use in memory tables for non-critical data that are accessed often (like
information about the last shown banner for users that don't have
cookies).
<LI>

Columns with identical information in different tables should be
declared identical and have identical names. Before Version 3.23 you
got slow joins otherwise.

Try to keep the names simple (use <CODE>name</CODE> instead of
<CODE>customer_name</CODE> in the customer table). To make your names portable
to other SQL servers you should keep them shorter than 18 characters.
<LI>

If you need REALLY high speed, you should take a look at the low-level
interfaces for data storage that the different SQL servers support!  For
example, by accessing the MySQL <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> directly, you could
get a speed increase of 2-5 times compared to using the SQL interface.
To be able to do this the data must be on the same server as
the application, and usually it should only be accessed by one process
(because external file locking is really slow).  One could eliminate the
above problems by introducing low-level <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> commands in the
MySQL server (this could be one easy way to get more
performance if needed).  By carefully designing the database interface,
it should be quite easy to support this types of optimization.
<LI>

In many cases it's faster to access data from a database (using a live
connection) than accessing a text file, just because the database is
likely to be more compact than the text file (if you are using numerical
data), and this will involve fewer disk accesses.  You will also save
code because you don't have to parse your text files to find line and
column boundaries.
<LI>

You can also use replication to speed things up. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Declaring a table with <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1</CODE> will make the updating of
indexes faster, as these are not logged to disk until the file is closed.
The downside is that you should run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on these tables before
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that they are okay if something killed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the middle.  As the key information can always be generated
from the data, you should not lose anything by using <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE>.

You can find a discussion about different locking methods in the appendix.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Locking_methods">G.4  Locking methods</A>.

</P>
<P>
All locking in MySQL is deadlock-free.  This is managed by always
requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning of a query and always
locking the tables in the same order.

</P>
<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no locks on the table, put a write lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>READ</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
When a lock is released, the lock is made available to the threads
in the write lock queue, then to the threads in the read lock queue.

</P>
<P>
This means that if you have many updates on a table, <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements will wait until there are no more updates.

</P>
<P>
To work around this for the case where you want to do many <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations on a table, you can insert rows in a temporary
table and update the real table with the records from the temporary table
once in a while.

</P>
<P>
This can be done with the following code:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES real_table WRITE, insert_table WRITE;
mysql&#62; insert into real_table select * from insert_table;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE insert_table;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> options with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> if you want to prioritize retrieval in some specific
cases.  You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
to get the same behaveour.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> can also help making table locks shorter.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You could also change the locking code in <TT>`mysys/thr_lock.c'</TT> to use a
single queue.  In this case, write locks and read locks would have the same
priority, which might help some applications.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX857"></A>

</P>
<P>
The table locking code in MySQL is deadlock free.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses table locking (instead of row locking or column
locking) on all table types, except <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, to achieve a very
high lock speed.  For large tables, table locking is MUCH better than
row locking for most applications, but there are, of course, some
pitfalls.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>BDB</CODE> and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, MySQL only uses table
locking if you explicitely lock the table with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or
execute a command that will modify every row in the table, like
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.  For these table types we recommend you to not use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> at all.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.7 and above, you can insert rows into
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time other threads are reading from the
table.  Note that currently this only works if there are no holes after
deleted rows in the table at the time the insert is made. When all holes
has been filled with new data, concurrent inserts will automatically be
enabled again.

</P>
<P>
Table locking enables many threads to read from a table at the same
time, but if a thread wants to write to a table, it must first get
exclusive access.  During the update, all other threads that want to
access this particular table will wait until the update is ready.

</P>
<P>
As updates on tables normally are considered to be more important than
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, all statements that update a table have higher priority
than statements that retrieve information from a table. This should
ensure that updates are not 'starved' because one issues a lot of heavy
queries against a specific table. (You can change this by using
LOW_PRIORITY with the statement that does the update or
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL Version 3.23.7 one can use the
<CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE> variable to force MySQL to
temporary give all <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, that wait for a table, a
higher priority after a specific number of inserts on a table.

</P>
<P>
Table locking is, however, not very good under the following senario:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A client issues a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that takes a long time to run.
<LI>

Another client then issues an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> on a used table. This client
will wait until the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is finished.
<LI>

Another client issues another <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement on the same table. As
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> has higher priority than <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, this <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
will wait for the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> to finish.  It will also wait for the first
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> to finish!
<LI>

A thread is waiting for something like <CODE>full disk</CODE>, in which case all
threads that wants to access the problem table will also be put in a waiting
state until more disk space is made available.
</UL>

<P>
Some possible solutions to this problem are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Try to get the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements to run faster. You may have to create
some summary tables to do this.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>.  This will give
all statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. In this case the last <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement in the previous
scenario would execute before the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

You can give a specific <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
statement lower priority with the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a low value for <STRONG>max_write_lock_count</STRONG> to give
<CODE>READ</CODE> locks after a certain number of <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks.

<LI>

You can specify that all updates from a specific thread should be done with
low priority by using the SQL command: <CODE>SET SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can specify that a specific <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is very important with the
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> combined with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
switch to use the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as these support concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s.

<LI>

If you mainly mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> will probably solve your problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.2  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>

MySQL keeps row data and index data in separate files. Many (almost
all) other databases mix row and index data in the same file. We believe that
the MySQL choice is better for a very wide range of modern systems.

</P>
<P>
Another way to store the row data is to keep the information for each
column in a separate area (examples are SDBM and Focus). This will cause a
performance hit for every query that accesses more than one column. Because
this degenerates so quickly when more than one column is accessed,
we believe that this model is not good for general purpose databases.

</P>
<P>
The more common case is that the index and data are stored together
(like in Oracle/Sybase et al). In this case you will find the row
information at the leaf page of the index. The good thing with this
layout is that it, in many cases, depending on how well the index is
cached, saves a disk read.  The bad things with this layout are:

Table scanning is much slower because you have to read through the indexes

You lose a lot of space, as you must duplicate indexes from the nodes
(as you can't store the row in the nodes).
<LI>

Deletes will degenerate the table over time (as indexes in nodes are
usually not updated on delete).
<LI>

It's harder to cache ONLY the index data.

One of the most basic optimization is to get your data (and indexes) to
take as little space on the disk (and in memory) as possible. This can
give huge improvements because disk reads are faster and normally less
main memory will be used. Indexing also takes less resources if
done on smaller columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports a lot of different table types and row formats.
Choosing the right table format may give you a big performance gain.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get better performance on a table and minimize storage space
using the techniques listed below:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use the most efficient (smallest) types possible. MySQL has
many specialized types that save disk space and memory.

<LI>

Use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables. For
example, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE> is often better than <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<LI>

Declare columns to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> if possible. It makes everything
faster and you save one bit per column. Note that if you really need
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in your application you should definitely use it. Just avoid
having it on all columns by default.

<LI>

If you don't have any variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), a fixed-size record format is
used. This is faster but unfortunately may waste some space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  MyISAM Table Formats</A>.

<LI>

The primary index of a table should be as short as possible. This makes
identification of one row easy and efficient.

<LI>

For each table, you have to decide which storage/index method to
use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

Only create the indexes that you really need. Indexes are good for
retrieval but bad when you need to store things fast. If you mostly
access a table by searching on a combination of columns, make an index
on them. The first index part should be the most used column. If you are
ALWAYS using many columns, you should use the column with more duplicates
first to get better compression of the index.

<LI>

If it's very likely that a column has a unique prefix on the first number
of characters, it's better to only index this prefix. MySQL
supports an index on a part of a character column. Shorter indexes are
faster not only because they take less disk space but also because they
will give you more hits in the index cache and thus fewer disk
seeks. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

In some circumstances it can be beneficial to split into two a table that is
scanned very often. This is especially true if it is a dynamic
format table and it is possible to use a smaller static format table that
can be used to find the relevant rows when scanning the table.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_indexes" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX866"></A>

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to find rows with a specific value of one column
fast. Without an index MySQL has to start with the first record
and then read through the whole table until it finds the relevant
rows. The bigger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index
for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly get a position to
seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the
data. If a table has 1000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than
reading sequentially. Note that if you need to access almost all 1000
rows it is faster to read sequentially because we then avoid disk seeks.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL indexes (<CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>, <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>, and
<CODE>INDEX</CODE>) are stored in B-trees. Strings are automatically prefix-
and end-space compressed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_INDEX">6.5.7  <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to:

<UL>
<LI>

Quickly find the rows that match a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.

<LI>

Find the <CODE>MAX()</CODE> or <CODE>MIN()</CODE> value for a specific indexed
column. This is optimized by a preprocessor that checks if you are
using <CODE>WHERE</CODE> key_part_# = constant on all key parts &#60; N.  In this case
MySQL will do a single key lookup and replace the <CODE>MIN()</CODE>
expression with a constant.  If all expressions are replaced with
constants, the query will return at once:


<PRE>
SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2) FROM table_name where key_part1=10
</PRE>

<LI>

Sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a leftmost
prefix of a usable key (for example, <CODE>ORDER BY key_part_1,key_part_2 </CODE>). The
key is read in reverse order if all key parts are followed by <CODE>DESC</CODE>.

The index can also be used even if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> doesn't match the index
exactly, as long as all the unused index parts and all the extra
are <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> columns are constants in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. The
following queries will use the index to resolve the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> part:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM foo ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,key_part3;
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE column=constant ORDER BY column, key_part1;
SELECT * FROM foo WHERE key_part1=const GROUP BY key_part2;
</PRE>

<LI>

In some cases a query can be optimized to retrieve values without
consulting the data file. If all used columns for some table are numeric
and form a leftmost prefix for some key, the values may be retrieved
from the index tree for greater speed:


<PRE>
SELECT key_part3 FROM table_name WHERE key_part1=1
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Suppose you issue the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
</PRE>

<P>
If a multiple-column index exists on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the
appropriate rows can be fetched directly. If separate single-column
indexes exist on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the optimizer tries to
find the most restrictive index by deciding which index will find fewer
rows and using that index to fetch the rows.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX867"></A>
<A NAME="IDX868"></A>
If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the
index can be used by the optimizer to find rows. For example, if you
have a three-column index on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, you have indexed
search capabilities on <CODE>(col1)</CODE>, <CODE>(col1,col2)</CODE>, and
<CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can't use a partial index if the columns don't form a
leftmost prefix of the index.  Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;
</PRE>

<P>
If an index exists on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, only the first query
shown above uses the index. The second and third queries do involve
indexed columns, but <CODE>(col2)</CODE> and <CODE>(col2,col3)</CODE> are not
leftmost prefixes of <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX869"></A>
<A NAME="IDX870"></A>
<A NAME="IDX871"></A>
<A NAME="IDX872"></A>
MySQL also uses indexes for <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons if the argument
to <CODE>LIKE</CODE> is a constant string that doesn't start with a wild-card
character.  For example, the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements use indexes:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "Patrick%";
mysql&#62; select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "Pat%_ck%";
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, only rows with <CODE>"Patrick" &#60;= key_col &#60;
"Patricl"</CODE> are considered.  In the second statement, only rows with
<CODE>"Pat" &#60;= key_col &#60; "Pau"</CODE> are considered.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements will not use indexes:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "%Patrick%";
mysql&#62; select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE other_col;
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value begins with a wild-card
character.  In the second statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value is not a
constant.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX873"></A>
<A NAME="IDX874"></A>
Searching using <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> will use indexes if column_name
is an index.

</P>
<P>
MySQL normally uses the index that finds the least number of rows. An
index is used for columns that you compare with the following operators:
<CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE>, <CODE>BETWEEN</CODE>, and a
<CODE>LIKE</CODE> with a non-wild-card prefix like <CODE>'something%'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Any index that doesn't span all <CODE>AND</CODE> levels in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
is not used to optimize the query. In other words:  To be able to use an
index, a prefix of the index must be used in every <CODE>AND</CODE> group.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2      /* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
... WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part_3=5
          /* optimized like "index_part1='hello'" */
... WHERE index1=1 and index2=2 or index1=3 and index3=3;
          /* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index 3 */
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2  /* index_part_1 is not used */
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10                  /* Index is not used in both AND parts */
... WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10  /* No index spans all rows */
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in some cases MySQL will not use an index, even if one
would be available.  Some of the cases where this happens are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If the use of the index would require MySQL to access more
than 30 % of the rows in the table.  (In this case a table scan is
probably much faster, as this will require us to do much fewer seeks).
Note that if such a query uses <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to only retrieve
part of the rows, MySQL will use an index anyway, as it can
much more quickly find the few rows to return in the result.
</UL>

<P>
All MySQL column types can be indexed.  Use of indexes on the
relevant columns is the best way to improve the performance of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
operations.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of keys and the maximum index length is defined per
table handler. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>. You can with all table handlers have
at least 16 keys and a total index length of at least 256 bytes.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, you can index a prefix of a
column.  This is much faster and requires less disk space than indexing the
whole column.  The syntax to use in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to
index a column prefix looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
KEY index_name (col_name(length))
</PRE>

<P>
The example below creates an index for the first 10 characters of the
<CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
           name CHAR(200) NOT NULL,
           KEY index_name (name(10)));
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, you must index a prefix of the
column.  You cannot index the entire column.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<STRONG>FULLTEXT</STRONG> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be
created only from <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column and partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can create indexes on multiple columns.  An index may
consist of up to 15 columns. (On <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns you
can also use a prefix of the column as a part of an index).

</P>
<P>
A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array containing values
that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses multiple-column indexes in such a way that queries are
fast when you specify a known quantity for the first column of the index in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, even if you don't specify values for the other columns.

</P>
<P>
Suppose a table is created using the following specification:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
           id INT NOT NULL,
           last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
           first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
           PRIMARY KEY (id),
           INDEX name (last_name,first_name));
</PRE>

<P>
Then the index <CODE>name</CODE> is an index over <CODE>last_name</CODE> and
<CODE>first_name</CODE>.  The index will be used for queries that specify
values in a known range for <CODE>last_name</CODE>, or for both <CODE>last_name</CODE>
and <CODE>first_name</CODE>.
Therefore, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                          AND first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                          AND (first_name="Michael" OR first_name="Monty");

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                          AND first_name &#62;="M" AND first_name &#60; "N";
</PRE>

<P>
However, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will NOT be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                          OR first_name="Michael";

<CODE>table_cache</CODE>, <CODE>max_connections</CODE>, and <CODE>max_tmp_tables</CODE>
affect the maximum number of files the server keeps open.  If you
increase one or both of these values, you may run up against a limit
imposed by your operating system on the per-process number of open file
descriptors.  However, you can increase the limit on many systems.
Consult your OS documentation to find out how to do this, because the
method for changing the limit varies widely from system to system.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>table_cache</CODE> is related to <CODE>max_connections</CODE>.  For example,
for 200 concurrent running connections, you should have a table cache of
at least <CODE>200 * n</CODE>, where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum number of tables
in a join.  You also need to reserve some extra file descriptors for
temporary tables and files.

</P>
<P>
The cache of open tables can grow to a maximum of <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
(default 64; this can be changed with the <CODE>-O table_cache=#</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>).  A table is never closed, except when the
cache is full and another thread tries to open a table or if you use
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure
to locate a cache entry to use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Tables that are not currently in use are released, in least-recently-used
order.

<LI>

If the cache is full and no tables can be released, but a new table needs to
be opened, the cache is temporarily extended as necessary.

<LI>

If the cache is in a temporarily-extended state and a table goes from in-use
to not-in-use state, the table is closed and released from the cache.
</UL>

<P>
A table is opened for each concurrent access. This means that
if you have two threads accessing the same table or access the table
twice in the same query (with <CODE>AS</CODE>) the table needs to be opened twice.
The first open of any table takes two file descriptors; each additional
use of the table takes only one file descriptor.  The extra descriptor
for the first open is used for the index file; this descriptor is shared
among all threads.

</P>
<P>
You can check if your table cache is too small by checking the mysqld
variable <CODE>opened_tables</CODE>.  If this is quite big, even if you
haven't done a lot of <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>, you should increase your table
cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.5.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have many files in a directory, open, close, and create operations will
be slow.  If you execute <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements on many different tables,
there will be a little overhead when the table cache is full, because for
every table that has to be opened, another must be closed. You can reduce
this overhead by making the table cache larger.

<P>
MySQL is multithreaded, so it may have many queries on the same
table simultaneously. To minimize the problem with two threads having
different states on the same file, the table is opened independently by
each concurrent thread. This takes some memory and one extra file
descriptor for the data file. The index file descriptor is shared
between all threads.

The default OS to use is really important!  To get the most use of
multiple CPU machines one should use Solaris (because the threads works
really nice) or Linux (because the 2.2 kernel has really good SMP
support). Also on 32-bit machines Linux has a 2G file size limit by
default. Hopefully this will be fixed soon when new filesystems are
released (XFS/Reiserfs).  If you have a desperate need for files bigger
than 2G on Linux-intel 32 bit, you should get the LFS patch for the ext2
file system.

Other tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have enough RAM, you could remove all swap devices. Some
operating systems will use a swap device in some contexts even if you
have free memory.
<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> MySQL option to avoid external
locking. Note that this will not impact MySQL's functionality as
long as you only run one server. Just remember to take down the server (or
lock relevant parts) before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. On some system
this switch is mandatory because the external locking does not work in any
case.

The <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> option is on by default when compiling with
MIT-pthreads, because <CODE>flock()</CODE> isn't fully supported by
MIT-pthreads on all platforms.  It's also on default for Linux
as Linux file locking are not yet safe.

The only case when you can't use <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> is if you run
multiple MySQL <EM>servers</EM> (not clients) on the same data,
or run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on the table without first flushing and locking
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server tables first.

You can still use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>/<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> even if you
are using <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>

<P>
If there is a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server currently running, you can see what
values it actually is using for the variables by executing this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

<P>
You can find a full description for all variables in the <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>
section in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.5.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also see some statistics from a running server by issuing the command
<CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.5.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses algorithms that are very scalable, so you can usually
run with very little memory. If you, however, give MySQL more
memory, you will normally also get better performance.

</P>
<P>
When tuning a MySQL server, the two most important variables to use
are <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> and <CODE>table_cache</CODE>.  You should first feel
confident that you have these right before trying to change any of the
other variables.

</P>
<P>
If you have much memory (&#62;=256M) and many tables and want maximum performance
with a moderate number of clients, you should use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=64M -O table_cache=256 \
           -O sort_buffer=4M -O record_buffer=1M &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you have only 128M and only a few tables, but you still do a lot of
sorting, you can use something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=16M -O sort_buffer=1M
</PRE>

<P>
If you have little memory and lots of connections, use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=100k \
           -O record_buffer=100k &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
or even:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=16k \
           -O table_cache=32 -O record_buffer=8k -O net_buffer=1K &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you are doing a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on files that are
much bigger than your available memory you should increase the value of
<CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE> to speed up the reading of rows after the sorting
is done.

</P>
<P>
When you have installed MySQL, the <TT>`support-files'</TT> directory will
contain some different <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> example files, <TT>`my-huge.cnf'</TT>,
<TT>`my-large.cnf'</TT>, <TT>`my-medium.cnf'</TT>, and <TT>`my-small.cnf'</TT>, you can
use as a base to optimize your system.

</P>
<P>
If there are very many connections, ``swapping problems'' may occur unless
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> has been configured to use very little memory for each
connection. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> performs better if you have enough memory for all
connections, of course.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you change an option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, it remains in effect only
for that instance of the server.

</P>
<P>
To see the effects of a parameter change, do something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld -O key_buffer=32m --help
</PRE>

<P>
Make sure that the <CODE>--help</CODE> option is last; otherwise, the effect of any
options listed after it on the command line will not be reflected in the
output.

Most of the following tests are done on Linux with the
MySQL benchmarks, but they should give some indication for
other operating systems and workloads.

</P>
<P>
You get the fastest executable when you link with <CODE>-static</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Linux, you will get the fastest code when compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>
and <CODE>-O3</CODE>. To compile <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with these options, you
need about 200M memory because <CODE>gcc/pgcc</CODE> needs a lot of memory to
make all functions inline. You should also set <CODE>CXX=gcc</CODE> when
configuring MySQL to avoid inclusion of the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
library (it is not needed). Note that with some versions of <CODE>pgcc</CODE>,
the resulting code will only run on true Pentium processors, even if you
use the compiler option that you want the resulting code to be working on
all x586 type processors (like AMD).

</P>
<P>
By just using a better compiler and/or better compiler options you can
get a 10-30 % speed increase in your application.  This is particularly
important if you compile the SQL server yourself!

</P>
<P>
We have tested both the Cygnus CodeFusion and Fujitsu compilers, but
when we tested them, neither was sufficiently bug free to allow
MySQL to be compiled with optimizations on.

</P>
<P>
When you compile MySQL you should only include support for the
character sets that you are going to use. (Option <CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE>).
The standard MySQL binary distributions are compiled with support
for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of some measurements that we have done:

<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>pgcc</CODE> and compile everything with <CODE>-O6</CODE>, the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is 1% faster than with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.

<LI>

If you link dynamically (without <CODE>-static</CODE>), the result is 13%
slower on Linux.  Note that you still can use a dynamic linked
MySQL library. It is only the server that is critical for
performance.

<LI>

If you strip your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary with <CODE>strip libexec/mysqld</CODE>,
the resulting binary can be up to 4 % faster.

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP rather than Unix sockets, the result is 7.5%
slower on the same computer. (If you are connection to <CODE>localhost</CODE>,
MySQL will, by default, use sockets).

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP from another computer over a 100M Ethernet,
things will be 8-11 % slower.

<LI>

If you compile with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, then you will loose 20 %
for most queries, but some queries may take substantially longer (The
MySQL benchmarks ran 35 % slower)
If you use <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, then you will only loose 15 %.
By starting a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version compiled with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>
with <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> the end result should be close to when
configuring with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>.

<LI>

On a Sun SPARCstation 20, SunPro C++ 4.2 is 5 % faster than <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.

<LI>

Compiling with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 for ultrasparc with the option
<CODE>-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa</CODE> gives 4 % more performance.

<LI>

On Solaris 2.5.1, MIT-pthreads is 8-12% slower than Solaris native
threads on a single processor. With more load/CPUs the difference should
get bigger.

<LI>

Running with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> makes <STRONG>[MySQL</STRONG> 1 % slower.

<LI>

Compiling on Linux-x86 using gcc without frame pointers
<CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE> or <CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp</CODE>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> 1-4% faster.
</UL>

<P>
The MySQL-Linux distribution provided by MySQL AB used
to be compiled with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>, but we had to go back to regular gcc
because of a bug in <CODE>pgcc</CODE> that would generate the code that does
not run on AMD. We will continue using gcc until that bug is resolved.
In the meantime, if you have a non-AMD machine, you can get a faster
binary by compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>.  The standard MySQL
Linux binary is linked statically to get it faster and more portable.

<H3><A NAME="Memory_use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Memory_use">5.5.4  How MySQL Uses Memory</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX904"></A>

</P>
<P>
The list below indicates some of the ways that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
uses memory.  Where applicable, the name of the server variable relevant
to the memory use is given:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The key buffer (variable <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>) is shared by all
threads; Other buffers used by the server are allocated as
needed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

Each connection uses some thread-specific space: A stack (default 64K,
variable <CODE>thread_stack</CODE>), a connection buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>), and a result buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>). The connection buffer and result buffer are
dynamically enlarged up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> when needed.  When
a query is running, a copy of the current query string is also allocated.

<LI>

All threads share the same base memory.

<LI>

Only the compressed ISAM / MyISAM tables are memory mapped.  This is
because the 32-bit memory space of 4GB is not large enough for most
big tables. When systems with a 64-bit address space become more
common we may add general support for memory mapping.

<LI>

Each request doing a sequential scan over a table allocates a read buffer
(variable <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>).

<LI>

When reading rows in 'random' order (for example after a sort) a
random-read buffer is allocated to avoid disk seeks.
(variable <CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE>).

<LI>

All joins are done in one pass, and most joins can be done without even
using a temporary table. Most temporary tables are memory-based (HEAP)
tables.  Temporary tables with a big record length (calculated as the
sum of all column lengths) or that contain <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns are
stored on disk.

One problem in MySQL versions before Version 3.23.2 is that if a HEAP table
exceeds the size of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>, you get the error <CODE>The
table tbl_name is full</CODE>. In newer versions this is handled by
automatically changing the in-memory (HEAP) table to a disk-based
(MyISAM) table as necessary. To work around this problem, you can
increase the temporary table size by setting the <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, or by setting the SQL option
<CODE>SQL_BIG_TABLES</CODE> in the client program.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>. In MySQL Version 3.20, the maximum size of the
temporary table was <CODE>record_buffer*16</CODE>, so if you are using this
version, you have to increase the value of <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>. You can
also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option to always
store temporary tables on disk. However, this will affect the speed of
many complicated queries.

<LI>

Most requests doing a sort allocates a sort buffer and 0-2 temporary
files depending on the result set size. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<LI>

Almost all parsing and calculating is done in a local memory store. No
memory overhead is needed for small items and the normal slow memory
allocation and freeing is avoided. Memory is allocated only for
unexpectedly large strings (this is done with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and
<CODE>free()</CODE>).

<LI>

Each index file is opened once and the data file is opened once for each
concurrently running thread. For each concurrent thread, a table structure,
column structures for each column, and a buffer of size <CODE>3 * n</CODE> is
allocated (where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum row length, not counting <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
columns). A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> uses 5 to 8 bytes plus the length of the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
data. The <CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table handlers will use one extra row
buffer for internal usage.

<LI>

For each table having <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, a buffer is enlarged dynamically
to read in larger <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values. If you scan a table, a buffer as large
as the largest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> value is allocated.

<LI>

Table handlers for all in-use tables are saved in a cache and managed as a
FIFO. Normally the cache has 64 entries. If a table has been used by two
running threads at the same time, the cache contains two entries for the
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.6  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<LI>

A <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> command closes all tables that are not in
use and marks all in-use tables to be closed when the currently executing
thread finishes. This will effectively free most in-use memory.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>ps</CODE> and other system status programs may report that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
uses a lot of memory. This may be caused by thread-stacks on different
memory addresses. For example, the Solaris version of <CODE>ps</CODE> counts
the unused memory between stacks as used memory. You can verify this by
checking available swap with <CODE>swap -s</CODE>. We have tested
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with commercial memory-leakage detectors, so there should
be no memory leaks.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX905"></A>
<A NAME="IDX906"></A>

</P>
<P>
When a new thread connects to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will span a
new thread to handle the request.  This thread will first check if the
hostname is in the hostname cache. If not the thread will call
<CODE>gethostbyaddr_r()</CODE> and <CODE>gethostbyname_r()</CODE> to resolve the
hostname.

</P>
<P>
If the operating system doesn't support the above thread-safe calls, the
thread will lock a mutex and call <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> and
<CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> instead. Note that in this case no other thread
can resolve other hostnames that is not in the hostname cache until the
first thread is ready.

</P>
<P>
You can disable DNS host lookup by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.  In this case you can however only use IP
names in the MySQL privilege tables.

</P>
<P>
If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you can get more performance by
either disabling DNS lookop with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> or by
increasing the <CODE>HOST_CACHE_SIZE</CODE> define (default: 128) and recompile
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can disable the hostname cache with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>. You
can clear the hostname cache with <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to allow connections over <CODE>TCP/IP</CODE>, you can do this
by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="SET_OPTION" HREF="manual_toc.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX907"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
SET [OPTION] SQL_VALUE_OPTION= value, ...
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>SET OPTION</CODE> sets various options that affect the operation of the
server or your client.  Any option you set remains in effect until the
current session ends, or until you set the option to a different value.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CHARACTER SET character_set_name | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
This maps all strings from and to the client with the given mapping.
Currently the only option for <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> is
<CODE>cp1251_koi8</CODE>, but you can easily add new mappings by editing the
<TT>`sql/convert.cc'</TT> file in the MySQL source distribution.  The
default mapping can be restored by using a <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> value of
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

Note that the syntax for setting the <CODE>CHARACTER SET</CODE> option differs
from the syntax for setting the other options.

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX908"></A>
Set the password for the current user. Any non-anonymous user can change his
own password!

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD FOR user = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
Set the password for a specific user on the current server host. Only a user
with access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can do this.  The user should be
given in <CODE>user@hostname</CODE> format, where <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>hostname</CODE>
are exactly as they are listed in the <CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> columns of
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table entry.  For example, if you had an entry with
<CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> fields of <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'%.loc.gov'</CODE>,
you would write:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR bob@"%.loc.gov" = PASSWORD("newpass");

or

mysql&#62; UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD("newpass") where user="bob' and host="%.loc.gov";
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> (default) then one can find the last inserted row
for a table with an auto_increment row with the following construct:
<CODE>WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL</CODE>.  This is used by some
ODBC programs like Access.

<DT><CODE>AUTOCOMMIT= 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> all changes to a table will be done at once. To start
a multi-command transaction, you have to use the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>. If set to <CODE>0</CODE> you have to use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> /
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to accept/revoke that transaction. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.  Note
that when you change from not <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode to
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, MySQL will do an automatic
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> on any open transactions.

<DT><CODE>SQL_BIG_TABLES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX909"></A>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all temporary tables are stored on disk rather than in
memory.  This will be a little slower, but you will not get the error
<CODE>The table tbl_name is full</CODE> for big <CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations that
require a large temporary table.  The default value for a new connection is
<CODE>0</CODE> (that is, use in-memory temporary tables).

<DT><CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, MySQL will abort if a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is attempted
that probably will take a very long time. This is useful when an inadvisable
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement has been issued. A big query is defined as a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> that probably will have to examine more than
<CODE>max_join_size</CODE> rows.  The default value for a new connection is
<CODE>1</CODE> (which will allow all <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements).

<DT><CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> will force the result from <CODE>SELECT</CODE>'s
to be put into a temporary table. This will help MySQL free the
table locks early and will help in cases where it takes a long time to
send the result set to the client.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and
and <CODE>LOCK TABLE WRITE</CODE> statements wait until there is no pending
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>LOCK TABLE READ</CODE> on the affected table.

<DT><CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>value</CODE> row combinations.  By setting this value, you can catch
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s where keys are not used properly and that would probably
take a long time. Setting this to a value other than <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> will reset
the <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> flag.  If you set the <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE>
flag again, the <CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE> variable will be ignored.
You can set a default value for this variable by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O max_join_size=#</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, MySQL will abort if an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is attempted that doesn't use a key or <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> in the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. This makes it possible to catch wrong updates
when creating SQL commands by hand.

<DT><CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of records to return from <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  If
a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> has a <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes precedence
over the value of <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE>.  The default value for a new
connection is ``unlimited.'' If you have changed the limit, the default value
can be restored by using a <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE> value of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_OFF = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, no logging will be done to the standard log for this
client, if the client has the <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege.  This does not
affect the update log!

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_UPDATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, no logging will be done to the update log for the client,
if the client has the <STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege.  This does not affect the
standard log!

<DT><CODE>SQL_QUOTE_SHOW_CREATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> will quote
table and column names. This is <STRONG>on</STRONG> by default,
for replication of tables with fancy column names to work.
section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_CREATE_TABLE">4.5.5.8  <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP = timestamp_value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Set the time for this client.  This is used to get the original timestamp if
you use the update log to restore rows.  <CODE>timestamp_value</CODE> should be a
UNIX Epoch timestamp, not a MySQL timestamp.

<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be returned from <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>. This is stored in
the update log when you use <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> in a command that updates
a table.

<DT><CODE>INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be used by the following <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
command when inserting an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value.  This is mainly used
with the update log.

<H2><A NAME="Disk_issues" HREF="manual_toc.html#Disk_issues">5.6  Disk Issues</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX910"></A>
<A NAME="IDX911"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As mentioned before, disks seeks are a big performance bottleneck. This
problems gets more and more apparent when the data starts to grow so
large that effective caching becomes impossible. For large databases,
where you access data more or less randomly, you can be sure that you
will need at least one disk seek to read and a couple of disk seeks to
write things. To minimize this problem, use disks with low seek times.

<LI>

Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce
the seek overhead) by either symlink files to different disks or striping
the disks.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Using symbolic links</STRONG>
<DD>
This means that you symlink the index and/or data file(s) from the
normal data directory to another disk (that may also be striped). This
makes both the seek and read times better (if the disks are not used for
other things). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links">5.6.1  Using Symbolic Links</A>.

<A NAME="IDX912"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Striping</STRONG>
<DD>
Striping means that you have many disks and put the first block on the
first disk, the second block on the second disk, and the Nth on the
(N mod number_of_disks) disk, and so on. This means if your normal data
size is less than the stripe size (or perfectly aligned) you will get
much better performance. Note that striping is very dependent on the OS
and stripe-size. So benchmark your application with different
stripe-sizes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Custom_Benchmarks">5.1.5  Using Your Own Benchmarks</A>.

Note that the speed difference for striping is <STRONG>very</STRONG> dependent
on the parameters. Depending on how you set the striping parameters and
number of disks you may get a difference in orders of magnitude. Note that
you have to choose to optimize for random or sequential access.
</DL>

<LI>

For reliability you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping + mirroring), but
in this case you will need 2*N drives to hold N drives of data. This is
probably the best option if you have the money for it!  You may, however,
also have to invest in some volume-management software to handle it
efficiently.

<LI>

A good option is to have semi-important data (that can be regenerated)
on RAID 0 disk while storing really important data (like host information
and logs) on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk. RAID N can be a problem if you
have many writes because of the time to update the parity bits.

<LI>

You may also set the parameters for the file system that the database
uses. One easy change is to mount the file system with the noatime
option. That makes it skip the updating of the last access time in the
inode and by this will avoid some disk seeks.

<LI>

On Linux, you can get much more performance (up to 100 % under load is
not uncommon) by using hdpram to configure your disk's interface!  The
following should be quite good hdparm options for MySQL (and
probably many other applications):


<PRE>
hdparm -m 16 -d 1
</PRE>

Note that the performance/reliability when using the above depends on
your hardware, so we strongly suggest that you test your system
thoroughly after using <CODE>hdparm</CODE>!  Please consult the <CODE>hdparm</CODE>
man page for more information!  If <CODE>hdparm</CODE> is not used wisely,
filesystem corruption may result.  Backup everything before experimenting!

<LI>

On many operating systems you can mount the disks with the 'async' flag to
set the file system to be updated asynchronously.  If your computer is
reasonable stable, this should give you more performance without sacrificing
too much reliability.  (This flag is on by default on Linux.)

<LI>

If you don't need to know when a file was last accessed (which is not
really useful on a database server), you can mount your file systems
with the noatime flag.

You can move tables and databases from the database directory to other
locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations.
You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file
system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by
spreading your tables to different disk.

</P>
<P>
The recommended may to do this, is to just symlink databases to different
disk and only symlink tables as a last resort.

The way to symlink a database is to first create a directory on some
disk where you have free space and then create a symlink to it from
the MySQL database directory.

<PRE>
shell&#62; mkdir /dr1/databases/test
shell&#62; ln -s /dr1/databases/test mysqld-datadir
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL doesn't support that you link one directory to multiple
databases.  Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link will
work fine as long as you don't make a symbolic link between databases.
Suppose you have a database <CODE>db1</CODE> under the MySQL data
directory, and then make a symlink <CODE>db2</CODE> that points to <CODE>db1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /path/to/datadir
shell&#62; ln -s db1 db2
</PRE>

<P>
Now, for any table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db1</CODE>, there also appears to be
a table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db2</CODE>.  If one thread updates <CODE>db1.tbl_a</CODE>
and another thread updates <CODE>db2.tbl_a</CODE>, there will be problems.

If you really need this, you must change the following code in

On Windows you can use internal symbolic links to directories by compiling
MySQL with <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE>. This allows you to put different
databases on different disks. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_symbolic_links">2.6.2.5  Splitting Data Across Different Disks on Windows</A>.

<P>
Before MySQL 4.0 you should not symlink tables, if you are not
very carefully with them. The problem is that if you run <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on a symlinked
table, the symlinks will be removed and replaced by the original
files. This happens because the above command works by creating a
temporary file in the database directory and when the command is
complete, replace the original file with the temporary file.

</P>
<P>
You should not symlink tables on system that doesn't have a fully
working <CODE>realpath()</CODE> call. (At least Linux and Solaris support
<CODE>realpath()</CODE>)

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0 symlinks is only fully supported for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  For other table types you will probably get strange problems
when doing any of the above mentioned commands.

</P>
<P>
The handling of symbolic links in MySQL 4.0 works the following
way (this is mostly relevant only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables).

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In the data directory you will always have the table definition file
and the data/index files.

<LI>

You can symlink the index file and the data file to different directories
independent of the other.

<LI>

The symlinking can be done from the operating system (if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is
not running) or with the <CODE>INDEX/DATA DIRECTORY="path-to-dir"</CODE> command
in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will not replace a symlink with the index/file but
work directly on the files the symlinks points to. Any temporary files
will be created in the same directory where the data/index file is.

<LI>

When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and the
file the symlink points to is dropped.  This is a good reason to why you
should NOT run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root and not allow persons to have write
access to the MySQL database directories.

<LI>

If you rename a table with <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> and you don't change
database, the symlink in the database directory will be renamed to the new
name and the data/index file will be renamed accordingly.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> to move a table to another database,
then the table will be moved to the other database directory and the old
symlinks and the files they pointed to will be deleted.

<LI>

If you are not using symlinks you should use the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that no one can drop or rename a file
outside of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.

<P>
This section describes the various ways to write strings and numbers in
MySQL.  It also covers the various nuances and ``gotchas'' that
you may run into when dealing with these basic types in MySQL.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="String_syntax" HREF="manual_toc.html#String_syntax">6.1.1.1  Strings</A></H4>

<P>
A string is a sequence of characters, surrounded by either single quote
(<SAMP>`''</SAMP>) or double quote (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>) characters (only the single quote
if you run in ANSI mode).  Examples:

</P>

<PRE>
'a string'
"another string"
</PRE>

<P>
Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning.  Each of these
sequences begins with a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>), known as the <EM>escape
character</EM>.  MySQL recognizes the following escape sequences:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\0</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX923"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX924"></A>
 
An ASCII 0 (<CODE>NUL</CODE>) character.

<A NAME="IDX925"></A>
<A NAME="IDX926"></A>
<DT><CODE>\'</CODE>
<DD>
A single quote (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>) character.

<A NAME="IDX927"></A>
<A NAME="IDX928"></A>
<DT><CODE>\"</CODE>
<DD>
A double quote (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>) character.

<A NAME="IDX929"></A>
<A NAME="IDX930"></A>
<DT><CODE>\b</CODE>
<DD>
A backspace character.

<A NAME="IDX931"></A>
<A NAME="IDX932"></A>
<DT><CODE>\n</CODE>
<DD>
A newline character.

<A NAME="IDX933"></A>
<A NAME="IDX934"></A>
<A NAME="IDX935"></A>
<DT><CODE>\r</CODE>
<DD>
A carriage return character.

<A NAME="IDX936"></A>
<A NAME="IDX937"></A>
<DT><CODE>\t</CODE>
<DD>
A tab character.

<A NAME="IDX938"></A>
<A NAME="IDX939"></A>
<DT><CODE>\z</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII(26) (Control-Z).  This character can be encoded to allow you to
go around the problem that ASCII(26) stands for END-OF-FILE on Windows.
(ASCII(26) will cause problems if you try to use
<CODE>mysql database &#60; filename</CODE>).

<A NAME="IDX940"></A>
<A NAME="IDX941"></A>
<DT><CODE>\\</CODE>
<DD>
A backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) character.

<A NAME="IDX942"></A>
<A NAME="IDX943"></A>
<DT><CODE>\%</CODE>
<DD>
A <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character. This is used to search for literal instances of
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in contexts where <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> would otherwise be interpreted
as a wild-card character. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_comparison_functions">6.3.2.1  String Comparison Functions</A>.

<A NAME="IDX944"></A>
<A NAME="IDX945"></A>
<DT><CODE>\_</CODE>
<DD>
A <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> character. This is used to search for literal instances of
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP> in contexts where <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> would otherwise be interpreted
as a wild-card character. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_comparison_functions">6.3.2.1  String Comparison Functions</A>.
</DL>

<P>
Note that if you use <SAMP>`\%'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`\_'</SAMP> in some string contexts, these
will return the strings <SAMP>`\%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`\_'</SAMP> and not <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX946"></A>
There are several ways to include quotes within a string:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <SAMP>`''</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`''</SAMP> may be written as <SAMP>`'''</SAMP>.

<LI>

A <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> may be written as <SAMP>`""'</SAMP>.

<LI>

You can precede the quote character with an escape character (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).

<LI>

A <SAMP>`''</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> needs no special treatment
and need not be doubled or escaped.  In the same way, <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> inside a
string quoted with <SAMP>`''</SAMP> needs no special treatment.
</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements shown below demonstrate how quoting and
escaping work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
| hello | "hello" | ""hello"" | hel'lo | 'hello |
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql&#62; SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";

If you want to insert binary data into a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column, the following
characters must be represented by escape sequences:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>NUL</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 0. You should represent this by <SAMP>`\0'</SAMP> (a backslash and an ASCII <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> character).
<DT><CODE>\</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 92, backslash.  Represent this by <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>'</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 39, single quote.  Represent this by <SAMP>`\''</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>"</CODE>

If you write C code, you can use the C API function
<CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> to escape characters for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_function_overview">8.4.2  C API Function Overview</A>.  In Perl, you can use the
<CODE>quote</CODE> method of the <CODE>DBI</CODE> package to convert special
characters to the proper escape sequences.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_DBI_Class">8.2.2  The <CODE>DBI</CODE> Interface</A>.

</P>
<P>
You should use an escape function on any string that might contain any of the
special characters listed above!

MySQL supports hexadecimal values.  In number context these act
like an integer (64-bit precision). In string context these act like a binary
string where each pair of hex digits is converted to a character:

       -&#62; 10
mysql&#62; select 0x5061756c;

Note that if the identifier is a restricted word or contains special characters
you must always quote it with <CODE>`</CODE> when you use it:

<PRE>
SELECT * from `select` where `select`.id &#62; 100;
</PRE>

<P>
In previous versions of MySQL, the name rules are as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A name may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current character set
and also <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>. The default character set is ISO-8859-1
Latin1; this may be changed with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE> option
to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

A name may start with any character that is legal in a name.  In particular,
a name may start with a number (this differs from many other database
systems!).  However, a name cannot consist <EM>only</EM> of numbers.

<LI>

You cannot use the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character in names because it is used to extend the
format by which you can refer to columns (see immediately below).
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended that you do not use names like <CODE>1e</CODE>, because
an expression like <CODE>1e+1</CODE> is ambiguous. It may be interpreted as the
expression <CODE>1e + 1</CODE> or as the number <CODE>1e+1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL you can refer to a column using any of the following forms:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column reference</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE>
from whichever table used in the query contains a column of that name.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the current database.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the database <CODE>db_name</CODE>.  This form is available in
MySQL Version 3.22 or later.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<CODE>`column_name`</CODE> </TD><TD> A column that is a keyword or contains special characters.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for
a column reference in a statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.
For example, suppose tables <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE> each contain a column
<CODE>c</CODE>, and you retrieve <CODE>c</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement that uses
both <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE>.  In this case, <CODE>c</CODE> is ambiguous because it
is not unique among the tables used in the statement, so you must indicate
which table you mean by writing <CODE>t1.c</CODE> or <CODE>t2.c</CODE>.  Similarly, if
you are retrieving from a table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db1</CODE> and from a
table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db2</CODE>, you must refer to columns in those
tables as <CODE>db1.t.col_name</CODE> and <CODE>db2.t.col_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX970"></A>
<A NAME="IDX971"></A>
The syntax <CODE>.tbl_name</CODE> means the table <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in the current
database.  This syntax is accepted for ODBC compatibility, because some ODBC
programs prefix table names with a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character.

In MySQL, databases and tables correspond to directories and files
within those directories.  Consequently, the case sensitivity of the
underlying operating system determines the case sensitivity of database and
table names.  This means database and table names are case sensitive in Unix
and case insensitive in Windows. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.4.1  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Although database and table names are case insensitive for
Windows, you should not refer to a given database or table using different
cases within the same query.  The following query would not work because it
refers to a table both as <CODE>my_table</CODE> and as <CODE>MY_TABLE</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
</PRE>

<P>
Column names are case insensitive in all cases.

</P>
<P>
Aliases on tables are case sensitive.  The following query would not work
because it refers to the alias both as <CODE>a</CODE> and as <CODE>A</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
           WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
</PRE>

<P>
Aliases on columns are case insensitive.

</P>
<P>
If you have a problem remembering the used cases for a table names,
adopt a consistent convention, such as always creating databases and
tables using lowercase names.

</P>
<P>
One way to avoid this problem is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>-O
lower_case_table_names=1</CODE>. By default this option is 1 on Windows and 0 on
Unix.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE> is 1 MySQL will convert all
table names to lower case on storage and lookup.  Note that if you
change this option, you need to first convert your old table names to
lower case before starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

MySQL supports thread-specific variables with the
<CODE>@variablename</CODE> syntax.  A variable name may consist of
alphanumeric characters from the current character set and also
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> . The default character set is
ISO-8859-1 Latin1; this may be changed with the

<P>
(We had to use the <CODE>:=</CODE> syntax here, because <CODE>=</CODE> was reserved for
comparisons.)

</P>
<P>
User variables may be used where expressions are allowed.  Note that
this does not currently include use in contexts where a number is explicitly
required, such as in the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement,
or the <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> clause of a <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>  In a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, each expression is only
evaluated when it's sent to the client.  This means that in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE>,
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause, you can't refer to an expression
that involves variables that are set in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. For example,
the following statement will NOT work as expected:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT (@aa:=id) AS a, (@aa+3) AS b FROM table_name HAVING b=5;
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that <CODE>@aa</CODE> will not contain the value of the current
row, but the value of <CODE>id</CODE> for the previous accepted row.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server supports the <CODE># to end of line</CODE>, <CODE>--
to end of line</CODE> and <CODE>/* in-line or multiple-line */</CODE> comment
styles:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; select 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; select 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql&#62; select 1+
/*
this is a
multiple-line comment
*/
1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>--</CODE> comment style requires you to have at least one space
after the <CODE>--</CODE>!

</P>
<P>
Although the server understands the comment syntax just described,
there are some limitations on the way that the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client
parses <CODE>/* ... */</CODE> comments:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Single-quote and double-quote characters are taken to indicate the beginning
of a quoted string, even within a comment.  If the quote is not matched by a
second quote within the comment, the parser doesn't realize the comment has
ended.  If you are running <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively, you can tell that it
has gotten confused like this because the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
to <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE>.

<LI>

A semicolon is taken to indicate the end of the current SQL statement
and anything following it to indicate the beginning of the next statement.
</UL>

<P>
These limitations apply both when you run <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively
and when you put commands in a file and tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its
input from that file with <CODE>mysql &#60; some-file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't support the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> ANSI SQL comment style.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Missing_comments">1.4.4.8  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A>.

<P>
A common problem stems from trying to create a table with column names that
use the names of datatypes or functions built into MySQL, such as
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE>.  You're allowed to do it (for example,
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is an allowed column name), but whitespace is not allowed between
a function name and the <SAMP>`('</SAMP> when using functions whose names are also
column names.

</P>
<P>
The following words are explicitly reserved in MySQL. Most of
them are forbidden by ANSI SQL92 as column and/or table names
(for example, <CODE>group</CODE>).
A few are reserved because MySQL needs them and is
(currently) using a <CODE>yacc</CODE> parser:

MySQL supports a number of column types, which may be grouped into
three categories: numeric types, date and time types, and string (character)
types.  This section first gives an overview of the types available and
summarizes the storage requirements for each column type, then provides a
more detailed description of the properties of the types in each category.
The overview is intentionally brief.  The more detailed descriptions should
be consulted for additional information about particular column types, such
as the allowable formats in which you can specify values.

</P>
<P>
The column types supported by MySQL are listed below.
The following code letters are used in the descriptions:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TINYINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX994"></A>
 

A very small integer. The signed range is <CODE>-128</CODE> to <CODE>127</CODE>. The
unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX995"></A>
<DT><CODE>SMALLINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A small integer. The signed range is <CODE>-32768</CODE> to <CODE>32767</CODE>. The
unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>65535</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX996"></A>
<DT><CODE>MEDIUMINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A medium-size integer. The signed range is <CODE>-8388608</CODE> to
<CODE>8388607</CODE>. The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>16777215</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX997"></A>
<DT><CODE>INT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A normal-size integer. The signed range is <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> to
<CODE>2147483647</CODE>.  The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>4294967295</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX998"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTEGER[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
This is a synonym for <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX999"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A large integer. The signed range is <CODE>-9223372036854775808</CODE> to
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>. The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to
<CODE>18446744073709551615</CODE>.

Some things you should be aware about <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> columns:


<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1000"></A>
As all arithmetic is done using signed <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
values, so you shouldn't use unsigned big integers larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE> (63 bits) except with bit functions! If you
do that, some of the last digits in the result may be wrong because of
rounding errors when converting the <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.
<LI>

You can always store an exact integer value in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column by
storing it as a string, as there is in this case there will be no
intermediate double representation.
<LI>

<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> will use <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> arithmetic when
both arguments are <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> values!  This means that if you
multiply two big integers (or results from functions that return
integers) you may get unexpected results when the result is larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1001"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1002"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1003"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT(precision) [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A floating-point number. Cannot be unsigned.  <CODE>precision</CODE> can be
<CODE>&#60;=24</CODE> for a single-precision floating-point number and between 25
and 53 for a double-precision floating-point number. These types are like
the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types described immediately below.
<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> has the same range as the corresponding <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types, but the display size and number of decimals is undefined.

In MySQL Version 3.23, this is a true floating-point value.  In
earlier MySQL versions, <CODE>FLOAT(precision)</CODE> always has 2 decimals.

Note that using <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> may give you some unexpected problems as
all calculation in MySQL is done with double precision.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#No_matching_rows">A.5.6  Solving Problems with No Matching Rows</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1006"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1007"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A small (single-precision) floating-point number. Cannot be unsigned.
Allowable values are <CODE>-3.402823466E+38</CODE> to
<CODE>-1.175494351E-38</CODE>, <CODE>0</CODE>, and <CODE>1.175494351E-38</CODE> to
<CODE>3.402823466E+38</CODE>.  The M is the display width and D is the
number of decimals.  <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> without an argument or with an argument of
&#60;= 24 stands for a single-precision floating-point number.

<A NAME="IDX1008"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1009"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOUBLE[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number. Cannot be
unsigned. Allowable values are <CODE>-1.7976931348623157E+308</CODE> to
<CODE>-2.2250738585072014E-308</CODE>, <CODE>0</CODE>, and
<CODE>2.2250738585072014E-308</CODE> to <CODE>1.7976931348623157E+308</CODE>.  The M
is the display width and D is the number of decimals.  <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
without an argument or <CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> where 25 &#60;= X &#60;= 53 stands for a
double-precision floating-point number.

<A NAME="IDX1011"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>REAL[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
These are synonyms for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1012"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECIMAL[(M[,D])] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
An unpacked floating-point number.  Cannot be unsigned.  Behaves like a
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> column: ``unpacked'' means the number is stored as a string,
using one character for each digit of the value.  The decimal point and,
for negative numbers, the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign, are not counted in M (but space
for these are reserved). If <CODE>D</CODE> is 0, values will have no decimal
point or fractional part.  The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> values is
the same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> column may be constrained by the choice of <CODE>M</CODE> and
<CODE>D</CODE>.

If <CODE>D</CODE> is left out it's set to 0. If <CODE>M</CODE> is left out it's set to 10.

Note that in MySQL Version 3.22 the <CODE>M</CODE> argument had to
includes the space needed for the sign and the decimal point.

<A NAME="IDX1013"></A>
<DT><CODE>NUMERIC(M,D) [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
This is a synonym for <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1014"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATE</CODE>
<DD>
A date.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.
MySQL displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1015"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
<DD>
A date and time combination.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01
00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  MySQL displays
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but allows you

<A NAME="IDX1016"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP[(M)]</CODE>
<DD>
A timestamp.  The range is <CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to sometime in the
year <CODE>2037</CODE>.  MySQL displays <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values in
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>, or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, depending on whether <CODE>M</CODE> is <CODE>14</CODE> (or missing), <CODE>12</CODE>,
<CODE>8</CODE>, or <CODE>6</CODE>, but allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
columns using either strings or numbers.  A <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is useful
for recording the date and time of an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
operation because it is automatically set to the date and time of the most
recent operation if you don't give it a value yourself.  You can also set it
to the current date and time by assigning it a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

A <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> is always stored in 4 bytes.  The <CODE>M</CODE> argument only
affects how the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is displayed.

Note that <CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> columns where X is 8 or 14 are reported to
be numbers while other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> columns are reported to be
strings.  This is just to ensure that one can reliably dump and restore
the table with these types!

<A NAME="IDX1017"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIME</CODE>
<DD>
A time.  The range is <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> to <CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.
MySQL displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1018"></A>
<DT><CODE>YEAR[(2|4)]</CODE>
<DD>
A year in 2- or 4-digit format (default is 4-digit).  The allowable values
are <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE>, <CODE>0000</CODE> in the 4-digit year format,
and 1970-2069 if you use the 2-digit format (70-69).  MySQL displays
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in <CODE>YYYY</CODE> format, but allows you to assign values to
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> columns using either strings or numbers. (The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> type is
new in MySQL Version 3.22.). See section <A HREF="manual.html#YEAR">6.2.2.4  The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> Type</A>.

<DT><CODE>[NATIONAL] CHAR(M) [BINARY]</CODE>
<DD>
A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to the
specified length when stored. The range of <CODE>M</CODE> is 1 to 255 characters.
Trailing spaces are removed when the value is retrieved. <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values
are sorted and compared in case-insensitive fashion according to the
default character set unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword is given.

<CODE>NATIONAL CHAR</CODE> (short form <CODE>NCHAR</CODE>) is the ANSI SQL way to
define that a CHAR column should use the default CHARACTER set.  This is
the default in MySQL.

<CODE>CHAR</CODE> is a shorthand for <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE>.

MySQL allows you to create a column of type
<CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>. This is mainly useful when you have to be compliant with
some old applications that depend on the existence of a column but that do not
actually use the value.  This is also quite nice when you need a
column that only can take 2 values: A <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>, that is not defined
as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, will only occupy one bit and can only take 2 values:
<CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>""</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHAR">6.2.3.1  The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> Types</A>.

the server/client protocol and MyISAM tables has currently a limit of
16M per communication packet / table row, you can't yet use this
the whole range of this type. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Numeric_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Numeric_types">6.2.1  Numeric Types</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL supports all of the ANSI/ISO SQL92 numeric types.  These
types include the exact numeric data types (<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>,
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and <CODE>SMALLINT</CODE>), as well as the
approximate numeric data types (<CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>). The keyword <CODE>INT</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and the keyword <CODE>DEC</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> types are implemented as the same
type by MySQL, as permitted by the SQL92 standard.  They are
used for values for which it is important to preserve exact precision,
for example with monetary data.  When declaring a column of one of these
types the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified; for
example:

</P>

<PRE>
    salary DECIMAL(9,2)
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, <CODE>9</CODE> (<CODE>precision</CODE>) represents the number of
significant decimal digits that will be stored for values, and <CODE>2</CODE>
(<CODE>scale</CODE>) represents the number of digits that will be stored
following the decimal point.  In this case, therefore, the range of
values that can be stored in the <CODE>salary</CODE> column is from
<CODE>-9999999.99</CODE> to <CODE>9999999.99</CODE>. 
(MySQL can actually store numbers up to <CODE>9999999.99</CODE> in this column
because it doesn't have to store the sign for positive numbers)

</P>
<P>
In ANSI/ISO SQL92, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL(p)</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>.  Similarly, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> is equivalent
to <CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>, where the implementation is allowed to decide
the value of <CODE>p</CODE>.  MySQL does not currently support either of these
variant forms of the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>/<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> data types.  This is
not generally a serious problem, as the principal benefits of these
types derive from the ability to control both precision and scale
explicitly.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values are stored as strings, rather
than as binary floating-point numbers, in order to preserve the decimal
precision of those values.  One character is used for each digit of the
value, the decimal point (if <CODE>scale</CODE> &#62; 0), and the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign
(for negative numbers).  If <CODE>scale</CODE> is 0, <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values contain no decimal point or fractional part.

</P>
<P>
The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values is the
same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column can be constrained by the
<CODE>precision</CODE> or <CODE>scale</CODE> for a given column.  When such a column
is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than
are allowed by the specified <CODE>scale</CODE>, the value is rounded to that
<CODE>scale</CODE>.  When a <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column is
assigned a value whose magnitude exceeds the range implied by the
specified (or defaulted) <CODE>precision</CODE> and <CODE>scale</CODE>,
MySQL stores the value representing the corresponding end
point of that range.

</P>
<P>
As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, MySQL also
supports the integral types <CODE>TINYINT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, and
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> as listed in the tables above.  Another extension is
supported by MySQL for optionally specifying the display width
of an integral value in parentheses following the base keyword for the
type (for example, <CODE>INT(4)</CODE>).  This optional width specification is
used to left-pad the display of values whose width is less than the
width specified for the column, but does not constrain the range of
values that can be stored in the column, nor the number of digits that
will be displayed for values whose width exceeds that specified for the
column.  When used in conjunction with the optional extension attribute
<CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>, the default padding of spaces is replaced with zeroes.
For example, for a column declared as <CODE>INT(5) ZEROFILL</CODE>, a value
of <CODE>4</CODE> is retrieved as <CODE>00004</CODE>.  Note that if you store larger
values than the display width in an integer column, you may experience
problems when MySQL generates temporary tables for some
complicated joins, as in these cases MySQL trusts that the
data did fit into the original column width.

</P>
<P>
All integral types can have an optional (non-standard) attribute
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>.  Unsigned values can be used when you want to allow
only positive numbers in a column and you need a little bigger numeric
range for the column.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> type is used to represent approximate numeric data
types. The ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard allows an optional specification of
the precision (but not the range of the exponent) in bits following the
keyword <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> in parentheses.  The MySQL implementation
also supports this optional precision specification.  When the keyword
<CODE>FLOAT</CODE> is used for a column type without a precision
specification, MySQL uses four bytes to store the values.  A
variant syntax is also supported, with two numbers given in parentheses
following the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> keyword.  With this option, the first number
continues to represent the storage requirements for the value in bytes,
and the second number specifies the number of digits to be stored and
displayed following the decimal point (as with <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>).  When MySQL is asked to store a number for
such a column with more decimal digits following the decimal point than
specified for the column, the value is rounded to eliminate the extra
digits when the value is stored.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>REAL</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> types do not accept
precision specifications.  As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92
standard, MySQL recognizes <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> as a synonym for the
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> type.  In contrast with the standard's
requirement that the precision for <CODE>REAL</CODE> be smaller than that used
for <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>, MySQL implements both as 8-byte
double-precision floating-point values (when not running in ``ANSI mode'').
For maximum portability, code requiring storage of approximate numeric
data values should use <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> with no
specification of precision or number of decimal points.

</P>
<P>
When asked to store a value in a numeric column that is outside the column
type's allowable range, MySQL clips the value to the appropriate
endpoint of the range and stores the resulting value instead.

</P>
<P>
For example, the range of an <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> to
<CODE>2147483647</CODE>.  If you try to insert <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> into an
<CODE>INT</CODE> column, the value is clipped to the lower endpoint of the range,
and <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> is stored instead. Similarly, if you try to insert
<CODE>9999999999</CODE>, <CODE>2147483647</CODE> is stored instead.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the size of the column's
range is the same but its endpoints shift up to <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967295</CODE>.
If you try to store <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> and <CODE>9999999999</CODE>,
the values stored in the column become <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967296</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Conversions that occur due to clipping are reported as ``warnings'' for
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
multi-row <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Date_and_time_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1038"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1039"></A>

</P>

<P>
The date and time types are <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE>.  Each of these has a
range of legal values, as well as a ``zero'' value that is used when you
specify a really illegal value.  Note that MySQL allows you to store
certain 'not strictly' legal date values, for example <CODE>1999-11-31</CODE>.
The reason for this is that we think it's the responsibility of the
application to handle date checking, not the SQL servers.  To make the
date checking 'fast', MySQL only checks that the month is in
the range of 0-12 and the day is in the range of 0-31. The above ranges
are defined this way because MySQL allows you to store, in a
<CODE>DATE</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column, dates where the day or month-day
is zero.  This is extremely useful for applications that need to store
a birth-date for which you don't know the exact date. In this case you
simply store the date like <CODE>1999-00-00</CODE> or <CODE>1999-01-00</CODE>.  (You
cannot expect to get a correct value from functions like <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>
or <CODE>DATE_ADD</CODE> for dates like these.)

</P>
<P>
Here are some general considerations to keep in mind when working
with date and time types:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a standard
format, but it attempts to interpret a variety of formats for values that
you supply (for example, when you specify a value to be assigned to or
compared to a date or time type).  Nevertheless, only the formats described
in the following sections are supported.  It is expected that you will supply
legal values, and unpredictable results may occur if you use values in other
formats.

<LI>

Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats, it
always expects the year part of date values to be leftmost.  Dates must be
given in year-month-day order (for example, <CODE>'98-09-04'</CODE>), rather than
in the month-day-year or day-month-year orders commonly used elsewhere (for
example, <CODE>'09-04-98'</CODE>, <CODE>'04-09-98'</CODE>).

<LI>

MySQL automatically converts a date or time type value to a number
if the value is used in a numeric context, and vice versa.

<LI>

When MySQL encounters a value for a date or time type that is
out of range or otherwise illegal for the type (see the start of this
section), it converts the value to the ``zero'' value for that type.
(The exception is that out-of-range <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are clipped to
the appropriate endpoint of the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range.)  The table below
shows the format of the ``zero'' value for each type:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>``Zero'' value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DATETIME</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DATE</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>00000000000000</CODE> (length depends on display size)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIME</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>YEAR</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0000</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>

The ``zero'' values are special, but you can store or refer to them
explicitly using the values shown in the table.  You can also do this
using the values <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>, which are easier to write.

<LI>

``Zero'' date or time values used through <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> are converted
automatically to <CODE>NULL</CODE> in <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> Version 2.50.12 and above,
because ODBC can't handle such values.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Y2K_issues" HREF="manual_toc.html#Y2K_issues">6.2.2.1  Y2K Issues and Date Types</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1040"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1041"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL itself is Y2K-safe (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.1.9  Year 2000 Compliance</A>),
but input values presented to MySQL may not be.  Any input
containing 2-digit year values is ambiguous, because the century is unknown.
Such values must be interpreted into 4-digit form because MySQL stores
years internally using four digits.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE> types,
MySQL interprets dates with ambiguous year values using the
following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Remember that these rules provide only reasonable guesses as to what your
data mean.  If the heuristics used by MySQL don't produce the
correct values, you should provide unambiguous input containing 4-digit
year values.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will sort 2-digit <CODE>YEAR/DATE/DATETIME</CODE> types properly.

</P>
<P>
Note also that some functions like <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> will convert a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to a number. This means that a timestamp with a
2-digit year will not work properly with these functions.  The fix in this
case is to convert the <CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to 4-digit year format or
use something like <CODE>MIN(DATE_ADD(timestamp,INTERVAL 0 DAYS))</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="DATETIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1042"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1043"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1044"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> types are related.
This section describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> type is used when you need values that contain both date
and time information.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  The supported range is
<CODE>'1000-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  (``Supported''
means that although earlier values might work, there is no guarantee that
they will.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATE</CODE> type is used when you need only a date value, without a time
part.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to
<CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column type provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> operations with the current
date and time.  If you have multiple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, only the first
one is updated automatically.

</P>
<P>
Automatic updating of the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column occurs under any of
the following conditions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement and some
other column changes value.  (Note that an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that sets a column
to the value it already has will not cause the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to be
updated, because if you set a column to its current value, MySQL
ignores the update for efficiency.)
<LI>

You explicitly set the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns other than the first may also be set to the current
date and time.  Just set the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> or to <CODE>NOW()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can set any <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to a value different than the current
date and time by setting it explicitly to the desired value.  This is true
even for the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column.  You can use this property if,
for example, you want a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> to be set to the current date and
time when you create a row, but not to be changed whenever the row is updated
later:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Let MySQL set the column when the row is created.
This will initialize it to the current date and time.

<LI>

When you perform subsequent updates to other columns in the row, set
the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column explicitly to its current value.
</UL>

<P>
On the other hand, you may find it just as easy to use a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
column that you initialize to <CODE>NOW()</CODE> when the row is created and
leave alone for subsequent updates.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values may range from the beginning of 1970 to sometime in
the year 2037, with a resolution of one second.  Values are displayed as
numbers.

</P>
<P>
The format in which MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>

All <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns have the same storage size, regardless of
display size.  The most common display sizes are 6, 8, 12, and 14.  You can
specify an arbitrary display size at table creation time, but values of 0 or
greater than 14 are coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to
13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values using
any of a common set of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed--any punctuation
character may be used as the delimiter between date parts or time parts.
For example, <CODE>'98-12-31 11:30:45'</CODE>, <CODE>'98.12.31 11+30+45'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98/12/31 11*30*45'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31 11^30^45'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.
A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed here, too.  For example, <CODE>'98-12-31'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98.12.31'</CODE>, <CODE>'98/12/31'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> or
<CODE>'YYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that the string makes sense as a
date.  For example, <CODE>'19970523091528'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523091528'</CODE> are
interpreted as <CODE>'1997-05-23 09:15:28'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971122129015'</CODE> is
illegal (it has a nonsensical minute part) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00
00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YYMMDD'</CODE>
format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>'19970523'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523'</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1997-05-23'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971332'</CODE> is illegal (it has nonsensical month
and day parts) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905132800</CODE> and <CODE>830905132800</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1983-09-05 13:28:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905</CODE> and <CODE>830905</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'1983-09-05'</CODE>.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> context, such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Illegal <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are converted
to the ``zero'' value of the appropriate type (<CODE>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</CODE>,
<CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>, or <CODE>00000000000000</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for month or day values that are less than
<CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-6-9'</CODE> is the same as <CODE>'1979-06-09'</CODE>.  Similarly,
for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for hour, month, or second values that are
less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-10-30 1:2:3'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'1979-10-30 01:02:03'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits long.  If the
number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the first 4
digits.  If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the
first 2 digits.  Numbers that are not one of these lengths are interpreted
as though padded with leading zeros to the closest length.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1045"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1046"></A>
Values specified as non-delimited strings are interpreted using their length
as given.  If the string is 8 or 14 characters long, the year is assumed to
be given by the first 4 characters.  Otherwise the year is assumed to be
given by the first 2 characters.  The string is interpreted from left to
right to find year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, for as many
parts as are present in the string.  This means you should not use strings
that have fewer than 6 characters.  For example, if you specify <CODE>'9903'</CODE>,
thinking that will represent March, 1999, you will find that MySQL
inserts a ``zero'' date into your table.  This is because the year and month
values are <CODE>99</CODE> and <CODE>03</CODE>, but the day part is missing (zero), so
the value is not a legal date.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns store legal values using the full precision with
which the value was specified, regardless of the display size.  This has
several implications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Always specify year, month, and day, even if your column types are
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(4)</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP(2)</CODE>.  Otherwise, the value will not
be a legal date and <CODE>0</CODE> will be stored.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to widen a narrow <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column,
information will be displayed that previously was ``hidden''.

<LI>

Similarly, narrowing a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column does not cause information to
be lost, except in the sense that less information is shown when the values
are displayed.

<LI>

Although <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are stored to full precision, the only
function that operates directly on the underlying stored value is
<CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>.  Other functions operate on the formatted retrieved
value.  This means you cannot use functions such as <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> or
<CODE>SECOND()</CODE> unless the relevant part of the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value is
included in the formatted value.  For example, the <CODE>HH</CODE> part of a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is not displayed unless the display size is at least
10, so trying to use <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> on shorter <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
produces a meaningless result.
</UL>

<P>
You can to some extent assign values of one date type to an object
of a different date type.  However, there may be some alteration
of the value or loss of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is set to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>,
because the <CODE>DATE</CODE> value contains no time information.

<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATE</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is deleted, because the
<CODE>DATE</CODE> type stores no time information.

<LI>

Remember that although <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values all can be specified using the same set of formats, the types do not
all have the same range of values.  For example, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
cannot be earlier than <CODE>1970</CODE> or later than <CODE>2037</CODE>.  This means
that a date such as <CODE>'1968-01-01'</CODE>, while legal as a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or
<CODE>DATE</CODE> value, is not a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value and will be
converted to <CODE>0</CODE> if assigned to such an object.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1047"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1048"></A>
Be aware of certain pitfalls when specifying date values:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The relaxed format allowed for values specified as strings can be deceiving.
For example, a value such as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE> might look like a time value
because of the <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> delimiter, but if used in a date context will be
interpreted as the year <CODE>'2010-11-12'</CODE>.  The value <CODE>'10:45:15'</CODE>
will be converted to <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> because <CODE>'45'</CODE> is not a legal
month.

<LI>

Year values specified as two digits are ambiguous, because the century is
unknown.  MySQL interprets 2-digit year values using the following
rules:


<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="TIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1049"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE>
format (or <CODE>'HHH:MM:SS'</CODE> format for large hours values).  <CODE>TIME</CODE>
values may range from <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> to <CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.  The reason
the hours part may be so large is that the <CODE>TIME</CODE> type may be used not
only to represent a time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also
elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater
than 24 hours, or even negative).

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in a variety of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in <CODE>'D HH:MM:SS.fraction'</CODE> format.  (Note that
MySQL doesn't yet store the fraction for the time column).  One
can also use one of the following ``relaxed'' syntax:

<CODE>HH:MM:SS.fraction</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM:SS</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH:MM:SS</CODE>,
<CODE>D HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH</CODE> or <CODE>SS</CODE>.  Here <CODE>D</CODE> is days between 0-33.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in <CODE>'HHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that
it makes sense as a time.  For example, <CODE>'101112'</CODE> is understood as
<CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>, but <CODE>'109712'</CODE> is illegal (it has a nonsensical
minute part) and becomes <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE> format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
For example, <CODE>101112</CODE> is understood as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>.  The following
alternative formats are also understood: <CODE>SS</CODE>, <CODE>MMSS</CODE>,<CODE>HHMMSS</CODE>,
<CODE>HHMMSS.fraction</CODE>.  Note that MySQL doesn't yet store the
fraction part.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>TIME</CODE> context, such as <CODE>CURRENT_TIME</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For <CODE>TIME</CODE> values specified as strings that include a time part
delimiter, it is not necessary to specify two digits for hours, minutes, or
seconds values that are less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'8:3:2'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'08:03:02'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Be careful about assigning ``short'' <CODE>TIME</CODE> values to a <CODE>TIME</CODE>
column. Without semicolon, MySQL interprets values using the 
assumption that the rightmost digits represent seconds. (MySQL 
interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values as elapsed time rather than as time of 
day.) For example, you might think of <CODE>'1112'</CODE> and <CODE>1112</CODE> as 
meaning <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE> (12 minutes after 11 o'clock), but
MySQL interprets them as <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE> (11 minutes, 12 seconds).
Similarly, <CODE>'12'</CODE> and <CODE>12</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'00:00:12'</CODE>.
<CODE>TIME</CODE> values with semicolon, instead, are always treated as
time of the day. That is <CODE>'11:12'</CODE> will mean <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE>,
not <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values that lie outside the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range
but are otherwise legal are clipped to the appropriate
endpoint of the range.  For example, <CODE>'-850:00:00'</CODE> and
<CODE>'850:00:00'</CODE> are converted to <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> and
<CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Illegal <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are converted to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.  Note that
because <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> is itself a legal <CODE>TIME</CODE> value, there is no way
to tell, from a value of <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> stored in a table, whether the
original value was specified as <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> or whether it was illegal.

converted to <CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2000</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>1999</CODE>.

<LI>

As a two-digit number in the range <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>99</CODE>.  Values in the

<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2001</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and <CODE>1970</CODE>
to <CODE>1999</CODE>.  Note that the range for two-digit numbers is slightly
different than the range for two-digit strings, because you cannot specify zero
directly as a number and have it be interpreted as <CODE>2000</CODE>.  You
<EM>must</EM> specify it as a string <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>'00'</CODE> or it will be

<P>
The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> types are similar, but differ in the
way they are stored and retrieved.

</P>
<P>
The length of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column is fixed to the length that you declare
when you create the table.  The length can be any value between 1 and 255.
(As of MySQL Version 3.23, the length of <CODE>CHAR</CODE> may be 0 to 255.)
When <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length.  When <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values are retrieved, trailing spaces are
removed.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are variable-length strings.  You can
declare a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to be any length between 1 and 255, just as
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns.  However, in contrast to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
values are stored using only as many characters as are needed, plus one byte
to record the length.  Values are not padded; instead, trailing spaces are
removed when values are stored.  (This space removal differs from the ANSI
SQL specification.)

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that
exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

<P>
The values retrieved from the <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR(4)</CODE> columns
will be the same in each case, because trailing spaces are removed from
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns upon retrieval.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are sorted and compared
in case-insensitive fashion, unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute was
specified when the table was created.  The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute means
that column values are sorted and compared in case-sensitive fashion
according to the ASCII order of the machine where the MySQL
server is running. <CODE>BINARY</CODE> doesn't affect how the column is stored
or retrieved.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute is sticky.  This means that if a column marked
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> is used in an expression, the whole expression is compared as a
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> value.

<P>
MySQL may silently change the type of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
column at table creation time.

A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of

</P>
<P>
The four <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types <CODE>TINYTEXT</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE>,
and <CODE>LONGTEXT</CODE> correspond to the four <CODE>BLOB</CODE> types and have the
same maximum lengths and storage requirements.  The only difference between
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types is that sorting and comparison is performed
in case-sensitive fashion for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values and case-insensitive fashion
for <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values.  In other words, a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> is a case-insensitive
<CODE>BLOB</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column that exceeds
the column type's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can have indexes on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns with
MySQL Version 3.23.2 and newer. Older versions of
MySQL did not support this.

There is no trailing-space removal for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns
when values are stored, as there is for <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1057"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1058"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values may be extremely long, you
may run up against some constraints when using them:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column, you must convert the column value into a fixed-length
object. The standard way to do this is with the <CODE>SUBSTRING</CODE>
function.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select comment from tbl_name,substring(comment,20) as substr
       ORDER BY substr;
</PRE>

If you don't do this, only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of the
column are used when sorting.  The default value of <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> is
1024; this value can be changed using the <CODE>-O</CODE> option when starting the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. You can group on an expression involving <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> values by specifying the column position or by using an alias:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select id,substring(blob_col,1,100) from tbl_name
           GROUP BY 2;
mysql&#62; select id,substring(blob_col,1,100) as b from tbl_name
           GROUP BY b;
</PRE>

<LI>

The maximum size of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> object is determined by its
type, but the largest value you can actually transmit between the client and
server is determined by the amount of available memory and the size of the
communications buffers.  You can change the message buffer size, but you must
do so on both the server and client ends. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that each <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> value is represented
internally by a separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all
other column types, for which storage is allocated once per column when
the table is opened.

<H4><A NAME="ENUM" HREF="manual_toc.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1060"></A>

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is a string object whose value normally is chosen from a list
of allowed values that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification
at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
The value may also be the empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) or <CODE>NULL</CODE> under
certain circumstances:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you insert an invalid value into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> (that is, a string not
present in the list of allowed values), the empty string is inserted
instead as a special error value.

<LI>

If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is declared <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is also a legal value
for the column, and the default value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value is the first element of the
list of allowed values.
</UL>

<P>
Each enumeration value has an index:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Values from the list of allowable elements in the column specification are
numbered beginning with 1.

<LI>

The index value of the empty string error value is 0.  This means that you
can use the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement to find rows into which invalid
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values were assigned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;
</PRE>

<LI>

The index of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>ENUM("one", "two", "three")</CODE> can
have any of the values shown below.  The index of each value is also shown:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Index</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>NULL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>""</CODE> </TD><TD> 0
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"one"</CODE> </TD><TD> 1
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"two"</CODE> </TD><TD> 2
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"three"</CODE> </TD><TD> 3
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
An enumeration can have a maximum of 65535 elements.

</P>
<P>
Lettercase is irrelevant when you assign values to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column.
However, values retrieved from the column later have lettercase matching the
values that were used to specify the allowable values at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
If you retrieve an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> in a numeric context, the column value's
index is returned.  For example, you can retrieve numeric values from
an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If you store a number into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the number is treated as an
index, and the value stored is the enumeration member with that index.
(However, this will not work with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>, which treats all
input as strings.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification.  (In other words,
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to their index numbers.)  For
example, <CODE>"a"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"b"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("a", "b")</CODE>, but
<CODE>"b"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"a"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("b", "a")</CODE>.  The empty
string sorts before non-empty strings, and <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
all other enumeration values.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE enum_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>ENUM</CODE> definition in the second column.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SET" HREF="manual_toc.html#SET">6.2.3.4  The <CODE>SET</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1061"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> is a string object that can have zero or more values, each of
which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the table
is created.  <CODE>SET</CODE> column values that consist of multiple set members
are specified with members separated by commas (<SAMP>`,'</SAMP>).  A consequence of
this is that <CODE>SET</CODE> member values cannot themselves contain commas.

</P>
<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>SET("one", "two") NOT NULL</CODE> can have
any of these values:

</P>

<PRE>
""
"one"
"two"
"one,two"
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum of 64 different members.

</P>
<P>
MySQL stores <CODE>SET</CODE> values numerically, with the low-order bit
of the stored value corresponding to the first set member.  If you retrieve a
<CODE>SET</CODE> value in a numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set
corresponding to the set members that make up the column value.  For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from a <CODE>SET</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If a number is stored into a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, the bits that
are set in the binary representation of the number determine the
set members in the column value.  Suppose a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>.  Then the members have the following bit
values:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>SET</CODE> <STRONG>member</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Decimal value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Binary value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>a</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0001</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>b</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>2</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0010</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>c</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>4</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0100</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>d</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>8</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1000</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
If you assign a value of <CODE>9</CODE> to this column, that is <CODE>1001</CODE> in
binary, so the first and fourth <CODE>SET</CODE> value members <CODE>"a"</CODE> and
<CODE>"d"</CODE> are selected and the resulting value is <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a value containing more than one <CODE>SET</CODE> element, it does not matter
what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value.  It also
does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the value.
When the value is retrieved later, each element in the value will appear
once, with elements listed according to the order in which they were
specified at table creation time.  For example, if a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>, then <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>, <CODE>"d,a"</CODE>, and
<CODE>"d,a,a,d,d"</CODE> will all appear as <CODE>"a,d"</CODE> when retrieved.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SET</CODE> values are sorted numerically.  <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> <CODE>SET</CODE> values.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a <CODE>SET</CODE> column using
the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> operator or the <CODE>FIND_IN_SET()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
But the following will also work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col &#38; 1;
</PRE>

<P>
The first of these statements looks for an exact match.  The second looks
for values containing the first set member.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE set_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>SET</CODE> definition in the second column.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1062"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1063"></A>

</P>
<P>
For the most efficient use of storage, try to use the most precise type in
all cases. For example, if an integer column will be used for values in the
range between <CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>99999</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED</CODE> is the
best type.

</P>
<P>
Accurate representation of monetary values is a common problem. In
MySQL, you should use the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> type. This is stored as
a string, so no loss of accuracy should occur. If accuracy is not
too important, the <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> type may also be good enough.

</P>
<P>
For high precision, you can always convert to a fixed-point type stored
in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>. This allows you to do all calculations with integers
and convert results back to floating-point values only when necessary.

To make it easier to use code written for SQL implementations from other

Column type mapping occurs at table creation time.  If you create a table
with types used by other vendors and then issue a <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE>
statement, MySQL reports the table structure using the equivalent
MySQL types.

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and the <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types are variable-length
types, for which the storage requirements depend on the actual length of
column values (represented by <CODE>L</CODE> in the preceding table), rather than
on the type's maximum possible size.  For example, a <CODE>VARCHAR(10)</CODE>
column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters.  The actual
storage required is the length of the string (<CODE>L</CODE>), plus 1 byte to
record the length of the string.  For the string <CODE>'abcd'</CODE>, <CODE>L</CODE> is 4
and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types require 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes to record
the length of the column value, depending on the maximum possible length of
the type.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a table includes any variable-length column types, the record format will
also be variable-length.  Note that when a table is created, MySQL
may, under certain conditions, change a column from a variable-length type to a
fixed-length type, or vice-versa.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

The size of an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> object is determined by the number of

65535 values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1079"></A>
The size of a <CODE>SET</CODE> object is determined by the number of different
set members.  If the set size is <CODE>N</CODE>, the object occupies <CODE>(N+7)/8</CODE>
bytes, rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes.  A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum

An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE> always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value

You can force MySQL to accept spaces after the function name by

Comparison operations result in a value of <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE), <CODE>0</CODE> (FALSE),
or <CODE>NULL</CODE>. These functions work for both numbers and strings.  Strings
are automatically converted to numbers and numbers to strings as needed (as
in Perl).

</P>
<P>
MySQL performs comparisons using the following
rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If one or both arguments are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the result of the comparison
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, except for the <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> operator.

<LI>

If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they are compared as
strings.

<LI>

If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not compared to a number.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1088"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1089"></A>
If one of the arguments is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column and
the other argument is a constant, the constant is converted
to a timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to be more
ODBC-friendly.

<LI>

In all other cases, the arguments are compared as floating-point (real)
numbers.
</UL>

<P>
By default, string comparisons are done in case-independent fashion using the
current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default, which also works
excellently for English).

</P>
<P>
The examples below illustrate conversion of strings to numbers for comparison
operations:

if the <CODE>IN</CODE> value list consists entirely of constants.  If <CODE>expr</CODE>

If <CODE>expr1</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> returns <CODE>expr1</CODE>,
else it returns <CODE>expr2</CODE>.  <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> returns a numeric or string
value, depending on the context in which it is used:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select IFNULL(1,0);

mysql&#62; select IFNULL(NULL,10);
        -&#62; 10

<DT><CODE>NULLIF(expr1,expr2)</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>expr1 = expr2</CODE> is true, return <CODE>NULL</CODE> else return <CODE>expr1</CODE>.
This is the same as <CODE>CASE WHEN x = y THEN NULL ELSE x END</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select NULLIF(1,1);
        -&#62; NULL
mysql&#62; select NULLIF(1,2);
        -&#62; 1

Note that <CODE>expr1</CODE> is evaluated twice in MySQL if the arguments
are equal.

<A NAME="IDX1129"></A>
<DT><CODE>IF(expr1,expr2,expr3)</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>expr1</CODE> is TRUE (<CODE>expr1 &#60;&#62; 0</CODE> and <CODE>expr1 &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>) then
<CODE>IF()</CODE> returns <CODE>expr2</CODE>, else it returns <CODE>expr3</CODE>.
<CODE>IF()</CODE> returns a numeric or string value, depending on the context
in which it is used:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select IF(1&#62;2,2,3);
        -&#62; 3
mysql&#62; select IF(1&#60;2,'yes','no');
        -&#62; 'yes'
mysql&#62; select IF(strcmp('test','test1'),'no','yes');
        -&#62; 'no'
</PRE>

<CODE>expr1</CODE> is evaluated as an integer value, which means that if you are
testing floating-point or string values, you should do so using a comparison
operation:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select IF(0.1,1,0);
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select IF(0.1&#60;&#62;0,1,0);
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

In the first case above, <CODE>IF(0.1)</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> because <CODE>0.1</CODE>
is converted to an integer value, resulting in a test of <CODE>IF(0)</CODE>.  This
may not be what you expect.  In the second case, the comparison tests the
original floating-point value to see whether it is non-zero.  The result
of the comparison is used as an integer.

The default return type of <CODE>IF()</CODE> (which may matter when it is
stored into a temporary table) is calculated in MySQL Version
3.23 as follows:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Expression</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Return value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns string </TD><TD> string
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns a floating-point value </TD><TD> floating-point
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns an integer </TD><TD> integer
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

If expr2 and expr3 are strings, then the result is case sensitive if
both strings are case sensitive. (Starting from 3.23.51)

<A NAME="IDX1130"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE value WHEN [compare-value] THEN result [WHEN [compare-value] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result [WHEN [condition] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
The first version returns the <CODE>result</CODE> where
<CODE>value=compare-value</CODE>. The second version returns the result for
the first condition, which is true. If there was no matching result
value, then the result after <CODE>ELSE</CODE> is returned. If there is no
<CODE>ELSE</CODE> part then <CODE>NULL</CODE> is returned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE 1 WHEN 1 THEN "one" WHEN 2 THEN "two" ELSE "more" END;
       -&#62; "one"
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE WHEN 1&#62;0 THEN "true" ELSE "false" END;
       -&#62; "true"
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE BINARY "B" when "a" then 1 when "b" then 2 END;
       -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The type of the return value (<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> or

<DT><CODE>LOAD_FILE(file_name)</CODE>
<DD>
Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string.  The file
must be on the server, you must specify the full pathname to the
file, and you must have the <STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege.  The file must
be readable by all and be smaller than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>.

If the file doesn't exist or can't be read due to one of the above reasons,
the function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>:

</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
If you are not using MySQL Version 3.23, you have to do the reading
of the file inside your application and create an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
to update the database with the file information. One way to do this, if
you are using the MySQL++ library, can be found at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html</a>.

<P>
MySQL automatically converts numbers to strings as necessary, and
vice-versa:

        -&#62; 2
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');

</PRE>

<P>
If you want to convert a number to a string explicitly, pass it as the
argument to <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If a string function is given a binary string as an argument, the resulting
string is also a binary string.  A number converted to a string is treated as
a binary string.  This only affects comparisons.

<DT><CODE>expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1182"></A>
 
Pattern matching using
SQL simple regular expression comparison. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE) or <CODE>0</CODE>
(FALSE).  With <CODE>LIKE</CODE> you can use the following two wild-card characters
in the pattern:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches any number of characters, even zero characters
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches exactly one character
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 'David!' LIKE 'David_';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select 'David!' LIKE '%D%v%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To test for literal instances of a wild-card character, precede the character
with the escape character.  If you don't specify the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> character,
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is assumed:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>\%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>%</CODE> character
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>\_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>_</CODE> character
</TD></TR>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 'David!' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select 'David_' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To specify a different escape character, use the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> clause:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 'David_' LIKE 'David|_' ESCAPE '|';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

The following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are
case insensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 'abc' LIKE 'ABC';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 'abc' LIKE BINARY 'ABC';
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric expressions! (This is a MySQL
extension to the ANSI SQL <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.)


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 10 LIKE '1%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that you use in your <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
strings.  For example, to search for <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\n'</SAMP>.  To
search for <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\\\'</SAMP> (the backslashes are stripped
once by the parser and another time when the pattern match is done, leaving
a single backslash to be matched).

Performs a pattern match of a string expression <CODE>expr</CODE> against a pattern
<CODE>pat</CODE>.  The pattern can be an extended regular expression.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Regexp">I  Description of MySQL regular expression syntax</A>.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>expr</CODE> matches <CODE>pat</CODE>, otherwise
returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>, provided for
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> compatibility. Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape
syntax in strings (for example, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that
you use in your <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> strings.  As of MySQL Version 3.23.4,
<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case insensitive for normal (not binary) strings:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select 'Monty!' REGEXP 'm%y%%';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select 'Monty!' REGEXP '.*';

positive floating-point number. Zero relevance means no similarity.
For <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> to work, a <STRONG>FULLTEXT</STRONG> index
must be created first. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> operator casts the string following it to a binary string.
This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be case sensitive even
if the column isn't defined as <CODE>BINARY</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "a" = "A";
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select BINARY "a" = "A";

<CODE>BINARY</CODE> was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.0.

Note that in some context MySQL will not be able to use the
index efficiently when you cast an indexed column to <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
If you want to compare a blob case-insensitively you can always convert
the blob to upper case before doing the comparison:

</P>

<PRE>

We plan to soon introduce casting between different character sets to
make string comparison even more flexible.

Note that the behavior of <CODE>ROUND()</CODE> when the argument
is half way between two integers depends on the C library
implementation.  Some round to the nearest even number,
always up, always down, or always towards zero.  If you need
one kind of rounding, you should use a well-defined function
like <CODE>TRUNCATE()</CODE> or <CODE>FLOOR()</CODE> instead.

<A NAME="IDX1218"></A>

<DT><CODE>ATAN2(Y,X)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the arc tangent of the two variables <CODE>X</CODE> and <CODE>Y</CODE>. It is
similar to calculating the arc tangent of <CODE>Y / X</CODE>, except that the

<A NAME="IDX1234"></A>
<DT><CODE>RAND()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>RAND(N)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a random floating-point value in the range <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.0</CODE>.
If an integer argument <CODE>N</CODE> is specified, it is used as the seed value:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select RAND();
        -&#62; 0.5925
mysql&#62; select RAND(20);

        -&#62; 0.2079
mysql&#62; select RAND();
        -&#62; 0.7888
</PRE>

You can't use a column with <CODE>RAND()</CODE> values in an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause, because <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> would evaluate the column multiple times.
In MySQL Version 3.23, you can, however, do:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND()</CODE>

This is useful to get a random sample of a set <CODE>SELECT * FROM
table1,table2 WHERE a=b AND c&#60;d ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000</CODE>.

Note that a <CODE>RAND()</CODE> in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be re-evaluated
every time the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is executed.

<A NAME="IDX1235"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAST(X,Y,...)</CODE>
<DD>
With two or more arguments, returns the smallest (minimum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the following rules:


<UL>
<LI>

If the return value is used in an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> context, or all arguments
are integer-valued, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

If the return value is used in a <CODE>REAL</CODE> context, or all arguments are
real-valued, they are compared as reals.

<LI>

If any argument is a case-sensitive string, the arguments are compared
as case-sensitive strings.

<LI>

In other cases, the arguments are compared as case-insensitive strings:
</UL>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select LEAST(2,0);
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select LEAST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
        -&#62; 3.0
mysql&#62; select LEAST("B","A","C");
        -&#62; "A"
</PRE>

In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use <CODE>MIN()</CODE>
instead of <CODE>LEAST</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1236"></A>
<DT><CODE>GREATEST(X,Y,...)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the largest (maximum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the same rules as for <CODE>LEAST</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select GREATEST(2,0);
        -&#62; 2
mysql&#62; select GREATEST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
        -&#62; 767.0
mysql&#62; select GREATEST("B","A","C");
        -&#62; "C"

In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use <CODE>MAX()</CODE>
instead of <CODE>GREATEST</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1237"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEGREES(X)</CODE>

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1238"></A>
<DT><CODE>RADIANS(X)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the argument <CODE>X</CODE>, converted from degrees to radians:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select RADIANS(90);
        -&#62; 1.570796
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1239"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRUNCATE(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number <CODE>X</CODE>, truncated to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals.  If <CODE>D</CODE>
is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no decimal point or fractional part:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select TRUNCATE(1.223,1);
        -&#62; 1.2
mysql&#62; select TRUNCATE(1.999,1);
        -&#62; 1.9
mysql&#62; select TRUNCATE(1.999,0);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select TRUNCATE(-1,999,1);
        -&#62; -1.9
</PRE>

Starting from MySQL 3.23.51 all numbers are rounded towards zero.

If <CODE>D</CODE> is negative, then the whole part of the number is zeroed out:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select truncate(122,-2);
       -&#62; 100
</PRE>

Note that as decimal numbers are normally not stored as exact numbers in
computers, but as double values, you may be fooled by the following
result:

<A NAME="IDX1240"></A>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select TRUNCATE(10.28*100,0);
       -&#62; 1027
</PRE>

The above happens because 10.28 is actually stored as something like 
10.2799999999999999.

These functions perform date arithmetic.  They are new for MySQL
Version 3.22.  <CODE>ADDDATE()</CODE> and <CODE>SUBDATE()</CODE> are synonyms for
<CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> and <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>.

In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> instead of
<CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> and <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE> if the expression on the right side is
a date or datetime column. (See example)

<CODE>date</CODE> is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>DATE</CODE> value specifying the starting
date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is an expression specifying the interval value to be added
or subtracted from the starting date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is a string; it may start
with a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> for negative intervals.  <CODE>type</CODE> is a keyword indicating
how the expression should be interpreted.

The related function <CODE>EXTRACT(type FROM date)</CODE> returns the 'type'
interval from the date.

MySQL allows any punctuation delimiter in the <CODE>expr</CODE> format.
Those shown in the table are the suggested delimiters.  If the <CODE>date</CODE>
argument is a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value and your calculations involve only
<CODE>YEAR</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH</CODE>, and <CODE>DAY</CODE> parts (that is, no time parts), the
result is a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value.  Otherwise the result is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "1997-12-31 23:59:59" + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
        -&#62; 1998-01-01 00:00:00
mysql&#62; SELECT INTERVAL 1 DAY + "1997-12-31";
        -&#62; 1998-01-01
mysql&#62; SELECT "1998-01-01" - INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
       -&#62; 1997-12-31 23:59:59
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                       INTERVAL 1 SECOND);
        -&#62; 1998-01-01 00:00:00
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                       INTERVAL 1 DAY);
        -&#62; 1998-01-01 23:59:59
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                       INTERVAL "1:1" MINUTE_SECOND);
        -&#62; 1998-01-01 00:01:00
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_SUB("1998-01-01 00:00:00",
                       INTERVAL "1 1:1:1" DAY_SECOND);
        -&#62; 1997-12-30 22:58:59
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1998-01-01 00:00:00",
                       INTERVAL "-1 10" DAY_HOUR);
        -&#62; 1997-12-30 14:00:00
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_SUB("1998-01-02", INTERVAL 31 DAY);
        -&#62; 1997-12-02
</PRE>

If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not include all the
interval parts that would be expected from the <CODE>type</CODE> keyword),
MySQL assumes you have left out the leftmost parts of the interval
value.  For example, if you specify a <CODE>type</CODE> of <CODE>DAY_SECOND</CODE>, the
value of <CODE>expr</CODE> is expected to have days, hours, minutes, and seconds
parts.  If you specify a value like <CODE>"1:10"</CODE>, MySQL assumes
that the days and hours parts are missing and the value represents minutes
and seconds.  In other words, <CODE>"1:10" DAY_SECOND</CODE> is interpreted in such
a way that it is equivalent to <CODE>"1:10" MINUTE_SECOND</CODE>.  This is
analogous to the way that MySQL interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values
as representing elapsed time rather than as time of day.

Note that if you add or subtract a date value against something that
contains a time part, the date value will be automatically converted to a
datetime value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select date_add("1999-01-01", interval 1 day);
       -&#62; 1999-01-02
mysql&#62; select date_add("1999-01-01", interval 1 hour);
       -&#62; 1999-01-01 01:00:00
</PRE>

If you use really incorrect dates, the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If you add
<CODE>MONTH</CODE>, <CODE>YEAR_MONTH</CODE>, or <CODE>YEAR</CODE> and the resulting date
has a day that is larger than the maximum day for the new month, the day is
adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select DATE_ADD('1998-01-30', Interval 1 month);
        -&#62; 1998-02-28
</PRE>

Note from the preceding example that the word <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> and the
<CODE>type</CODE> keyword are not case sensitive.

<A NAME="IDX1263"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRACT(type FROM date)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>EXTRACT()</CODE> function uses the same kinds of interval type
specifiers as <CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> or <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>, but extracts parts
from the date rather than performing date arithmetic.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "1999-07-02");
       -&#62; 1999
mysql&#62; SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM "1999-07-02 01:02:03");
       -&#62; 199907
mysql&#62; SELECT EXTRACT(DAY_MINUTE FROM "1999-07-02 01:02:03");

mysql&#62; select TO_DAYS('1997-10-07');

<CODE>TO_DAYS()</CODE> is not intended for use with values that precede the advent
of the Gregorian calendar (1582), because it doesn't take into account the
days that were lost when the calendar was changed.

<A NAME="IDX1265"></A>
<DT><CODE>FROM_DAYS(N)</CODE>

        -&#62; '1997-10-07'
</PRE>

<CODE>FROM_DAYS()</CODE> is not intended for use with values that precede the

<A NAME="IDX1275"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date)</CODE>
<DD>
If called with no argument, returns a Unix timestamp (seconds since
<CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> GMT). If <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> is called with
a <CODE>date</CODE> argument, it returns the value of the argument as seconds since

a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> string, a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, or a number in the format
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> in local time:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select UNIX_TIMESTAMP();

</PRE>

When <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP</CODE> is used on a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the function
will receive the value directly, with no implicit

Returns the <CODE>seconds</CODE> argument, converted to hours, minutes, and seconds,
as a value in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE> format, depending on whether
the function is used in a string or numeric context:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select SEC_TO_TIME(2378);

<A NAME="IDX1299"></A>
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> encryption is non-reversible.

<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> does not perform password encryption in the same way that
Unix passwords are encrypted.  You should not assume that if your Unix

<DT><CODE>ENCRYPT(str[,salt])</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using the Unix <CODE>crypt()</CODE> system call. The

If <CODE>crypt()</CODE> is not available on your system, <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> always
returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> ignores all but the first 8 characters of <CODE>str</CODE>, at

Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the password.
To decrypt the result, use <CODE>DECODE()</CODE>.

The results is a binary string of the same length as <CODE>string</CODE>.
If you want to save it in a column, use a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column type.

<A NAME="IDX1302"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECODE(crypt_str,pass_str)</CODE>
<DD>
Descrypts the encrypted string <CODE>crypt_str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the
password.  <CODE>crypt_str</CODE> should be a string returned from
<CODE>ENCODE()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1303"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD5(string)</CODE>
<DD>
Calculates a MD5 checksum for the string. Value is returned as a 32 long
hex number that may, for example, be used as a hash key:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select MD5("testing");
        -&#62; 'ae2b1fca515949e5d54fb22b8ed95575'
</PRE>

This is an "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm".

<A NAME="IDX1304"></A>
<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID([expr])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select LAST_INSERT_ID();
        -&#62; 195
</PRE>

The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

If you insert many rows at the same time with an insert statement,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> returns the value for the first inserted row.
The reason for this is so that you it makes it possible to easily reproduce
the same <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement against some other server.

<A NAME="IDX1305"></A>
If <CODE>expr</CODE> is given as an argument to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, then
the value of the argument is returned by the function, is set as the
next value to be returned by <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> and used as the next
auto_increment value.  This can be used to simulate sequences:

First create the table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; create table sequence (id int not null);
mysql&#62; insert into sequence values (0);
</PRE>

Then the table can be used to generate sequence numbers like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; update sequence set id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id+1);
</PRE>

You can generate sequences without calling <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, but the
utility of using the function this way is that the ID value is maintained in
the server as the last automatically generated value.  You can retrieve the
new ID as you would read any normal <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value in
MySQL.  For example, <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> (without an argument)
will return the new ID.  The C API function <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>
can also be used to get the value.

Note that as <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is only updated after
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements, you can't use this function
to retrieve the value for <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE> after executing
other SQL statements like <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1306"></A>
<DT><CODE>FORMAT(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Formats the number <CODE>X</CODE> to a format like <CODE>'#,###,###.##'</CODE>, rounded
to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals.  If <CODE>D</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no
decimal point or fractional part:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select FORMAT(12332.123456, 4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1235'
mysql&#62; select FORMAT(12332.1,4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1000'
mysql&#62; select FORMAT(12332.2,0);
        -&#62; '12,332'
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1307"></A>
<DT><CODE>VERSION()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a string indicating the MySQL server version:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select VERSION();
        -&#62; '3.23.13-log'
</PRE>

Note that if your version ends with <CODE>-log</CODE> this means that logging is
enabled.

<A NAME="IDX1308"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONNECTION_ID()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the connection id (<CODE>thread_id</CODE>) for the connection.
Every connection has its own unique id:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select CONNECTION_ID();
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1309"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1310"></A>
<DT><CODE>GET_LOCK(str,timeout)</CODE>
<DD>
Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string <CODE>str</CODE>, with a
timeout of <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was obtained
successfully, <CODE>0</CODE> if the attempt timed out, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> if an error
occurred (such as running out of memory or the thread was killed with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE>).  A lock is released when you execute
<CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>, execute a new <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>, or the thread
terminates.  This function can be used to implement application locks or to
simulate record locks.  It blocks requests by other clients for locks with
the same name; clients that agree on a given lock string name can use the
string to perform cooperative advisory locking:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select GET_LOCK("lock1",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select GET_LOCK("lock2",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select RELEASE_LOCK("lock2");
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select RELEASE_LOCK("lock1");
        -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

Note that the second <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE> call returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> because
the lock <CODE>"lock1"</CODE> was automatically released by the second
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> call.

<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<DT><CODE>RELEASE_LOCK(str)</CODE>
<DD>
Releases the lock named by the string <CODE>str</CODE> that was obtained with
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was released, <CODE>0</CODE> if the
lock wasn't locked by this thread (in which case the lock is not released),
and <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the named lock didn't exist.  The lock will not exist if
it was never obtained by a call to <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> or if it already has
been released.

The <CODE>DO</CODE> statement is convinient to use with <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#DO">6.4.9  <CODE>DO</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>
<DT><CODE>BENCHMARK(count,expr)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> function executes the expression <CODE>expr</CODE>
repeatedly <CODE>count</CODE> times.  It may be used to time how fast MySQL
processes the expression.  The result value is always <CODE>0</CODE>.  The intended
use is in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, which reports query execution times:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select BENCHMARK(1000000,encode("hello","goodbye"));
+----------------------------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,encode("hello","goodbye")) |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                            0 |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (4.74 sec)
</PRE>

The time reported is elapsed time on the client end, not CPU time on the
server end.  It may be advisable to execute <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> several
times, and interpret the result with regard to how heavily loaded the
server machine is.

<A NAME="IDX1313"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_NTOA(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the network address (4 or 8 byte) for the numeric expression:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select INET_NTOA(3520061480);
       -&#62;  "209.207.224.40"
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1314"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_ATON(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns an integer that represents the numeric value for a network address.
Addresses may be 4 or 8 byte addresses:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select INET_ATON("209.207.224.40");
       -&#62;  3520061480
</PRE>

The generated number is always in network byte order; For example the
above number is calculated as <CODE>209*256^3 + 207*256^2 + 224*256 +40</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1315"></A>
<DT><CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name, log_pos)</CODE>
<DD>
Blocks until the slave reaches the specified position in the master log during
replication. If master information is not initialized, returns NULL. If the
slave is not running, will block and wait until it is started and goes to or
past
the specified position. If the slave is already past the specified position,
returns immediately. The return value is the number of log events it had to
wait to get to the specified position, or NULL in case of error. Useful for
control of master-slave synchronization, but was originally written to
facilitate replication testing.

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.
<CODE>select_expression</CODE> indicates the columns you want to retrieve.
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> may also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 + 1;
         -&#62; 2
</PRE>

<P>
All keywords used must be given in exactly the order shown above. For example,
a <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause must come after any <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause and before
any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1318"></A>
A <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expression may be given an alias using <CODE>AS</CODE>. The alias
is used as the expression's column name and can be used with
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clauses.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select concat(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
    from mytable ORDER BY full_name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>FROM table_references</CODE> clause indicates the tables from which to
retrieve rows.  If you name more than one table, you are performing a
join.  For information on join syntax, see section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can refer to a column as <CODE>col_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE>, or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE>.  You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for a column reference in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>,
for examples of ambiguity that require the more explicit column reference
forms.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1320"></A>
A table reference may be aliased using <CODE>tbl_name [AS] alias_name</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select t1.name, t2.salary from employee AS t1, info AS t2
           where t1.name = t2.name;
mysql&#62; select t1.name, t2.salary from employee t1, info t2
           where t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

Columns selected for output may be referred to in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
positions.  Column positions begin with 1:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select college, region, seed from tournament
           ORDER BY region, seed;
mysql&#62; select college, region AS r, seed AS s from tournament
           ORDER BY r, s;
mysql&#62; select college, region, seed from tournament
           ORDER BY 2, 3;
</PRE>

To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the
name of the column in the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause that you are sorting by.
The default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using
the <CODE>ASC</CODE> keyword.

<LI>

You can in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause use any of the functions that
MySQL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Functions">6.3  Functions for Use in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause can refer to any column or alias named in the
<CODE>select_expression</CODE>. It is applied last, just before items are sent to
the client, with no optimization. Don't use <CODE>HAVING</CODE> for items that
should be in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  For example, do not write this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select col_name from tbl_name HAVING col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

Write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select col_name from tbl_name WHERE col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

In MySQL Version 3.22.5 or later, you can also write queries like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select user,max(salary) from users
           group by user HAVING max(salary)&#62;10;
</PRE>

In older MySQL versions, you can write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select user,max(salary) AS sum from users
           group by user HAVING sum&#62;10;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE>,
<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE>, and <CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> are MySQL extensions
to ANSI SQL92.

<LI>

<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> will give the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> higher priority than
a statement that updates a table.  You should only use this for queries
that are very fast and must be done at once.  A <CODE>SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE>
query will run if the table is locked for read even if there is an update
statement that is waiting for the table to be free.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE> can be used with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
to tell the optimizer that the result set will have many rows.  In this case,
MySQL will directly use disk-based temporary tables if needed.
MySQL will also, in this case, prefer sorting to doing a
temporary table with a key on the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> elements.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> will force the result to be put into a temporary
table. This will help MySQL free the table locks early and will help
in cases where it takes a long time to send the result set to the client.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, a MySQL-specific option, can be used
with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> to tell the optimizer that the
result set will be small.  In this case, MySQL will use fast
temporary tables to store the resulting table instead of using sorting. In
MySQL Version 3.23 this shouldn't normally be needed.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1321"></A>
If you use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, the output rows will be sorted according to the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> as if you would have had an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> over all the fields
in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. MySQL has extended the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> so that
you can also specify <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> to <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>:


<PRE>
SELECT a,COUNT(b) FROM test_table GROUP BY a DESC
</PRE>

<LI>

MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to allow you to
select fields which are not mentioned in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause.
If you are not getting the results you expect from your query, please
read the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> description.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Group_by_functions">M.3  Functions for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> forces the optimizer to join the tables in the order in
which they are listed in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause. You can use this to speed up
a query if the optimizer joins the tables in non-optimal order.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned
by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.  <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes one or two numeric
arguments.

If two arguments are given, the first specifies the offset of the first row to
return, the second specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
The offset of the initial row is 0 (not 1):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from table LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15
</PRE>

If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows to return:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from table LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows
</PRE>

In other words, <CODE>LIMIT n</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>LIMIT 0,n</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1322"></A>
The <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'</CODE> form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> writes
the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server host and
cannot already exist (among other things, this prevents database tables and
files such as <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> from being destroyed).  You must have the
<STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege on the server host to use this form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> is mainly intended to let you very
quickly dump a table on the server machine. If you want to create the
resulting file on some other host than the server host you can't use
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>. In this case you should instead use some
client program like <CODE>mysqldump --tab</CODE> or <CODE>mysql -e "SELECT
..." &#62; outfile</CODE> to generate the file.

<CODE>SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>; the syntax for the <CODE>export_options</CODE> part of the statement
consists of the same <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses that are used
with the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

In the resulting text file, only the following characters are escaped by
the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character:


<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character

<LI>The first character in <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>

<LI>The first character in <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>

</UL>

Additionally, <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is converted to <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> followed by 0
(<CODE>ASCII 48</CODE>).

The reason for the above is that you MUST escape any <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>, or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
characters to reliably be able to read the file back. <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is
escaped to make it easier to view with some pagers.

As the resulting file doesn't have to conform to the SQL syntax, nothing
else need be escaped.

Here follows an example of getting a file in the format used by many
old programs.


<PRE>
SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/result.text"
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
FROM test_table;
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1323"></A>
If you use <CODE>INTO DUMPFILE</CODE> instead of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, MySQL
will only write one row into the file, without any column or line
terminations and without any escaping.  This is useful if you want to
store a blob in a file.

<LI>

Note that any file created by <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>INTO
DUMPFILE</CODE> is going to be readable for all users!  The reason is that the
MySQL server can't create a file that is owned by anyone else
than the user it's running as (you should never run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root),
the file has to be word readable so that you can retrieve the rows.

<LI>

If you are using <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE> on a table handler with page/row locks,
the examined rows will be write locked.

A table reference may be aliased using <CODE>tbl_name AS alias_name</CODE> or
<CODE>tbl_name alias_name</CODE>:

mysql&#62; select t1.name, t2.salary from employee AS t1, info AS t2
           where t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>ON</CODE> conditional is any conditional of the form that may be used in
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

If there is no matching record for the right table in the <CODE>ON</CODE> or
<CODE>USING</CODE> part in a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>, a row with all columns set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is used for the right table.  You can use this fact to find
records in a table that have no counterpart in another table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select table1.* from table1
           LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
           where table2.id is NULL;
</PRE>

This example finds all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with an <CODE>id</CODE> value that is
not present in <CODE>table2</CODE> (that is, all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with no
corresponding row in <CODE>table2</CODE>).  This assumes that <CODE>table2.id</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, of course. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LEFT_JOIN_optimization">5.2.6  How MySQL Optimizes <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>USING</CODE> <CODE>(column_list)</CODE> clause names a list of columns that must
exist in both tables.  A <CODE>USING</CODE> clause such as:


<PRE>
A LEFT JOIN B USING (C1,C2,C3,...)
</PRE>

is defined to be semantically identical to an <CODE>ON</CODE> expression like
this:


<PRE>
A.C1=B.C1 AND A.C2=B.C2 AND A.C3=B.C3,...
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN</CODE> of two tables is defined to be

with a <CODE>USING</CODE> clause that names all columns that exist in both
tables.

<LI>

<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> works analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.  To keep code
portable across databases, it's recommended to use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>
instead of <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> is identical to <CODE>JOIN</CODE>, except that the left table
is always read before the right table. This can be used for those (few)
cases where the join optimizer puts the tables in the wrong order.

<LI>

As of MySQL Version 3.23.12, you can give hints about which
index MySQL should use when retrieving information from a
table. This is useful if <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> shows that MySQL is
using the wrong index.  By specifying <CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>, you
can tell MySQL to use only one of the specified indexes to
find rows in the table.  The alternative syntax <CODE>IGNORE INDEX
(key_list)</CODE> can be used to tell MySQL to not use some
particular index.

<CODE>INSERT</CODE> inserts new rows into an existing table.  The <CODE>INSERT
...  VALUES</CODE> form of the statement inserts rows based on explicitly
specified values.  The <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> form inserts rows
selected from another table or tables.  The <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES</CODE>

<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the table into which rows should be inserted.  The column
name list or the <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns the statement
specifies values for:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you specify no column list for <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES</CODE> or <CODE>INSERT
... SELECT</CODE>, values for all columns must be provided in the
<CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list or by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  If you don't know the order of
the columns in the table, use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to find out.

<LI>

Any column not explicitly given a value is set to its default value.  For
example, if you specify a column list that doesn't name all the columns in
the table, unnamed columns are set to their default values.  Default value
assignment is described in section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

An <CODE>expression</CODE> may refer to any column that was set earlier in a value
list.  For example, you can say this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(15,col1*2);
</PRE>

But not this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);
</PRE>

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the
table.  In this case the client has to wait until the insert statement
is completed, which may take a long time if the table is in heavy
use. This is in contrast to <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, which lets the client
continue at once.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> syntax</A>.  Note that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
should normally not be used with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as this disables
concurrent inserts. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  MyISAM Tables</A>.

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with many value
rows, any rows that duplicate an existing <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
key in the table are ignored and are not inserted.  If you do not specify
<CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the insert is aborted if there is any row that duplicates an
existing key value.  You can determine with the C API function
<CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> how many rows were inserted into the table.

<LI>

If MySQL was configured using the <CODE>DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS</CODE>
option, <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements generate an error unless you explicitly
specify values for all columns that require a non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

You can find the value used for an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column

<PRE>
INSERT DELAYED ...
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement is a
MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients
that can't wait for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to complete.  This is a common
problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also
periodically run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that take a
long time to complete.  <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> was introduced in MySQL
Version 3.22.15.  It is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> only works with <CODE>ISAM</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  Note that as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables supports concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, if there is no free blocks in the
middle of the data file, you very seldom need to use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  MyISAM Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, the client will get an OK at once
and the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by any other thread.

</P>
<P>
Another major benefit of using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is that inserts
from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much
faster than doing many separate inserts.

</P>
<P>
Note that currently the queued rows are only stored in memory until they are
inserted into the table.  This means that if you kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
the hard way (<CODE>kill -9</CODE>) or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly, any
queued rows that weren't written to disk are lost!

</P>
<P>
The following describes in detail what happens when you use the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>.  In this
description, the ``thread'' is the thread that received an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command and ``handler'' is the thread that handles all
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statements for a particular table.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When a thread executes a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statement for a table, a handler
thread is created to process all <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statements for the table, if
no such handler already exists.

<LI>

The thread checks whether or not the handler has acquired a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>
lock already; if not, it tells the handler thread to do so.  The
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> lock can be obtained even if other threads have a <CODE>READ</CODE>
or <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock on the table.  However, the handler will wait for all
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> locks or <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> to ensure that the table
structure is up to date.

<LI>

The thread executes the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement, but instead of writing
the row to the table, it puts a copy of the final row into a queue that
is managed by the handler thread. Any syntax errors are noticed by the
thread and reported to the client program.

<LI>

The client can't report the number of duplicates or the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
value for the resulting row; it can't obtain them from the server, because
the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> returns before the insert operation has been completed.  If
you use the C API, the <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> function doesn't return anything
meaningful, for the same reason.

<LI>

The update log is updated by the handler thread when the row is inserted into
the table.  In case of multiple-row inserts, the update log is updated when
the first row is inserted.

<LI>

After every <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows are written, the handler checks
whether or not any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are still pending.  If so, it
allows these to execute before continuing.

<A NAME="IDX1345"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1346"></A>
<LI>

When the handler has no more rows in its queue, the table is unlocked.  If no
new <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands are received within
<CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE> seconds, the handler terminates.

<LI>

If more than <CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE> rows are pending already in a
specific handler queue, the thread requesting <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
waits until there is room in the queue.  This is done to ensure that
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't use all memory for the delayed memory
queue.

<LI>

The handler thread will show up in the MySQL process list
with <CODE>delayed_insert</CODE> in the <CODE>Command</CODE> column.  It will
be killed if you execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> command or kill it with
<CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>. However, it will first store all queued rows into the
table before exiting. During this time it will not accept any new
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands from another thread. If you execute an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command after this, a new handler thread will be created.

<LI>

Note that the above means that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands have higher
priority than normal <CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands if there is an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler already running!  Other update commands will have to wait
until the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> queue is empty, someone kills the handler
thread (with <CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>), or someone executes <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

The following status variables provide information about <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> commands:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Variable</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_insert_threads</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of handler threads
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_writes</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows written with <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Not_flushed_delayed_rows</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows waiting to be written
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

You can view these variables by issuing a <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE> statement or
by executing a <CODE>mysqladmin extended-status</CODE> command.
</UL>

<P>
Note that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is slower than a normal INSERT if the
table is not in use.  There is also the additional overhead for the
server to handle a separate thread for each table on which you use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This means that you should only use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> when you are really sure you need it!

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> updates columns in existing table rows with new values.
The <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns to modify and the values
they should be given.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, if given, specifies
which rows should be updated.  Otherwise all rows are updated. If the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is specified, the rows will be updated in the
order that is specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the update statement will not
abort even if we get duplicate key errors during the update.  Rows that
would cause conflicts will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
If you access a column from <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in an expression,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> uses the current value of the column.  For example, the
following statement sets the <CODE>age</CODE> column to one more than its
current value:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> assignments are evaluated from left to right.  For example, the
following statement doubles the <CODE>age</CODE> column, then increments it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age*2, age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices
this and doesn't update it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1348"></A>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> returns the number of rows that were actually changed.
In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
returns the number of rows that were matched and updated and the number of
warnings that occurred during the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> to ensure that
only a given number of rows are changed.

<PRE>
DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] FROM tbl_name
    [WHERE where_definition]
    [LIMIT rows]
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> deletes rows from <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> that satisfy the condition
given by <CODE>where_definition</CODE>, and returns the number of records deleted.

</P>
<P>
If you issue a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, all rows are
deleted.  If you do this in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, this works as
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.6  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>. One problem with this is that
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> will return zero as the number of affected records, but
this will be fixed in 4.0.

</P>
<P>
If you really want to know how many records are deleted when you are deleting
all rows, and are willing to suffer a speed penalty, you can use a
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement of this form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE 1&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this is MUCH slower than <CODE>DELETE FROM tbl_name</CODE> with no
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, because it deletes rows one at a time.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations reuse old record positions. To reclaim unused space and reduce
file sizes, use the <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> statement or the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
utility to reorganize tables.  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier, but
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is faster.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimization">4.4.6.10  Table Optimization</A>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL-specific <CODE>LIMIT rows</CODE> option to <CODE>DELETE</CODE> tells
the server the maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is
returned to the client.  This can be used to ensure that a specific
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> command doesn't take too much time.  You can simply repeat
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command until the number of affected rows is less than
the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> value.

<P>
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> works exactly like <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, except that if an old
record in the table has the same value as a new record on a unique index,
the old record is deleted before the new record is inserted.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.2  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
In other words, you can't access the values of the old row from a
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> statement.  In some old MySQL version it looked
like you could do this, but that was a bug that has been corrected.

</P>
<P>
When one uses a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>
will return 2 if the new row replaced and old row.  This is because in
this case one row was inserted and then the duplicate was deleted.

The above makes it easy to check if <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> added or replaced a
row.

<P>
The <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement reads rows from a text file into a
table at a very high speed.  If the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> keyword is specified, the
file is read from the client host.  If <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is not specified, the
file must be located on the server.  (<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is available in
MySQL Version 3.22.6 or later.)

</P>
<P>
For security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the
files must either reside in the database directory or be readable by all.
Also, to use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on server files, you must have the
<STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege on the server host.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges_provided">4.2.6  Privileges Provided by MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement is delayed until no other clients are reading
from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>CONCURRENT</CODE> with a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
then other threads can retrieve data from the table while <CODE>LOAD
DATA</CODE> is executing. Using this option will of course affect the
performance of <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> a bit even if no other thread is using
the table at the same time.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> will be a bit slower than letting the server access the
files directly, because the contents of the file must travel from the client
host to the server host.  On the other hand, you do not need the
<STRONG>file</STRONG> privilege to load local files.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL before Version 3.23.24 you can't read from a
FIFO with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If you need to read from a FIFO (for
example the output from gunzip), use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE>
instead.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1353"></A>
You can also load data files by using the <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> utility; it
operates by sending a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command to the server.  The
<CODE>--local</CODE> option causes <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to read data files from the
client host.  You can specify the <CODE>--compress</CODE> option to get better
performance over slow networks if the client and server support the
compressed protocol.

When locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.

<LI>

If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,
the server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.

<LI>

If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for
the file in the database directory of the current database.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these rules mean a file given as <TT>`./myfile.txt'</TT> is read from
the server's data directory, whereas a file given as <TT>`myfile.txt'</TT> is
read from the database directory of the current database.  For example,
the following <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement reads the file <TT>`data.txt'</TT>
from the database directory for <CODE>db1</CODE> because <CODE>db1</CODE> is the current
database, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a
table in the <CODE>db2</CODE> database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE db1;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "data.txt" INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> and <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> keywords control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text
file is ignored.

</P>
<P>
If you load data from a local file using the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> keyword, the server
has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the operation,
so the default bahavior is the same as if <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is specified.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on an empty <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
all non-unique indexes are created in a separate batch (like in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).
This normally makes <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> much faster when you have many
indexes.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
To write data from a database to a file, use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
To read the file back into the database, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
The syntax of the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses is the same for
both commands.  Both clauses are optional, but <CODE>FIELDS</CODE>
must precede <CODE>LINES</CODE> if both are specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause,
each of its subclauses (<CODE>TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED
BY</CODE>, and <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>) is also optional, except that you must
specify at least one of them.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause, the defaults are the
same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>LINES</CODE> clause, the default
is the same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
</PRE>

<P>
In other words, the defaults cause <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to act as follows
when reading input:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Look for line boundaries at newlines.

<LI>

Break lines into fields at tabs.

<LI>

Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Interpret occurrences of tab, newline, or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> preceded by
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> as literal characters that are part of field values.
</UL>

<P>
Conversely, the defaults cause <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to act as
follows when writing output:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Write tabs between fields.

<LI>

Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> to escape instances of tab, newline or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that occur
within field values.

<LI>

Write newlines at the ends of lines.
</UL>

<P>
Note that to write <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\\'</CODE>, you must specify two
backslashes for the value to be read as a single backslash.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> option can be used to ignore a header of
column names at the start of the file:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/file_name" into table test IGNORE 1 LINES;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> in tandem with <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to write data from a database into a file and then read
the file back into the database later, the field and line handling
options for both commands must match.  Otherwise, <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE> will not interpret the contents of the file properly.  Suppose
you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to write a file with
fields delimited by commas:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
           FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
To read the comma-delimited file back in, the correct statement would be:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
</PRE>

<P>
If instead you tried to read in the file with the statement shown below, it
wouldn't work because it instructs <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to look for
tabs between fields:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
           FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
</PRE>

<P>
The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as
a single field.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> can be used to read files obtained from
external sources, too. For example, a file in dBASE format will have
fields separated by commas and enclosed in double quotes.  If lines in
the file are terminated by newlines, the command shown below
illustrates the field and line handling options you would use to load
the file:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
           LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
</PRE>

<P>
Any of the field or line handling options may specify an empty string
(<CODE>''</CODE>).  If not empty, the <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
and <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> values must be a single character.  The
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values may
be more than one character.  For example, to write lines that are
terminated by carriage return-linefeed pairs, or to read a file
containing such lines, specify a <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'</CODE>
clause.

</P>
<P>
For example, to read a file of jokes, that are separated with a line
of <CODE>%%</CODE>, into a SQL table you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
create table jokes (a int not null auto_increment primary key, joke text
not null);
load data infile "/tmp/jokes.txt" into table jokes fields terminated by ""
lines terminated by "\n%%\n" (joke);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> controls quoting of fields.  For
output (<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>), if you omit the word
<CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, all fields are enclosed by the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
character.  An example of such output (using a comma as the field
delimiter) is shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
</PRE>

<P>
If you specify <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character is
used only to enclose <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> fields:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
Note that occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character within a
field value are escaped by prefixing them with the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
character.  Also note that if you specify an empty <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
value, it is possible to generate output that cannot be read properly by
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. For example, the output just shown above would
appear as shown below if the escape character is empty.  Observe that the
second field in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
For input, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character, if present, is stripped from the
ends of field values.  (This is true whether or not <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE> is
specified; <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE> has no effect on input interpretation.)
Occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character preceded by the
<CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character are interpreted as part of the current field
value.  In addition, duplicated <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> characters occurring
within fields are interpreted as single <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> characters if the
field itself starts with that character.  For example, if <CODE>ENCLOSED BY
'"'</CODE> is specified, quotes are handled as shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -&#62; The ""BIG"" boss
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> controls how to write or read special characters.
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, it is used to prefix
the following characters on output:

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The first character of the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values
<LI>

ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (what is actually written following the escape character is
ASCII <CODE>'0'</CODE>, not a zero-valued byte)
</UL>

<P>
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is empty, no characters are escaped.
It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character,
particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters in
the list just given.

</P>
<P>
For input, if the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, occurrences
of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally
as part of a field value.  The exceptions are an escaped <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`N'</SAMP> (for example, <CODE>\0</CODE> or <CODE>\N</CODE> if the escape character is
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  These sequences are interpreted as ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (a zero-valued
byte) and <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  See below for the rules on <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling.

</P>
<P>
For more information about <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-escape syntax,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>.

</P>
<P>
In certain cases, field and line handling options interact:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> is an empty string and <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE> is non-empty, lines are also terminated with
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>.
<LI>

If the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> values are
both empty (<CODE>''</CODE>), a fixed-row (non-delimited) format is used.  With
fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields. Instead, column
values are written and read using the ``display'' widths of the columns.  For
example, if a column is declared as <CODE>INT(7)</CODE>, values for the column are
written using 7-character fields.  On input, values for the column are
obtained by reading 7 characters.  Fixed-row format also affects handling of
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values; see below.  Note that fixed-size format will not work
if you are using a multi-byte character set.
</UL>

<P>
Handling of <CODE>NULL</CODE> values varies, depending on the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> options you use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For the default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> values,
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as <CODE>\N</CODE> for output and <CODE>\N</CODE> is read
as <CODE>NULL</CODE> for input (assuming the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
is <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> is not empty, a field containing the literal
word <CODE>NULL</CODE> as its value is read as a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value (this differs
from the word <CODE>NULL</CODE> enclosed within <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
characters, which is read as the string <CODE>'NULL'</CODE>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as the word
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

With fixed-row format (which happens when <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> are both empty), <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as an empty
string.  Note that this causes both <CODE>NULL</CODE> values and empty strings in
the table to be indistinguishable when written to the file because they are
both written as empty strings.  If you need to be able to tell the two apart
when reading the file back in, you should not use fixed-row format.
</UL>

<P>
Some cases are not supported by <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>:

<UL>

<LI>

Fixed-size rows (<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED
BY</CODE> both empty) and <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

<LI>

If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of another,
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> won't be able to interpret the input properly.
For example, the following <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause would cause problems:


<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
</PRE>

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, a field value that contains an occurrence
of <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
followed by the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> value will cause <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to stop reading a field or line too early.
This happens because <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> cannot properly determine
where the field or line value ends.
</UL>

<P>
The following example loads all columns of the <CODE>persondata</CODE> table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
</PRE>

<P>
No field list is specified, so <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> expects input rows
to contain a field for each table column.  The default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> values are used.

</P>
<P>
If you wish to load only some of a table's columns, specify a field list:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt'
           INTO TABLE persondata (col1,col2,...);
</PRE>

<P>
You must also specify a field list if the order of the fields in the input
file differs from the order of the columns in the table.  Otherwise,
MySQL cannot tell how to match up input fields with table columns.

</P>
<P>
If a row has too few fields, the columns for which no input field is present
are set to default values.  Default value assignment is described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
An empty field value is interpreted differently than if the field value
is missing:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For string types, the column is set to the empty string.

<LI>

For numeric types, the column is set to <CODE>0</CODE>.

<LI>

For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate ``zero''
value for the type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these are the same values that result if you assign an empty
string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly
in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns are only set to the current date and time if there
is a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value for the column, or (for the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column only) if the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is left out from the field list
when a field list is specified.

</P>
<P>
If an input row has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and
the number of warnings is incremented.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> regards all input as strings, so you can't use
numeric values for <CODE>ENUM</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE> columns the way you can with
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  All <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> values must be
specified as strings!

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1354"></A>
If you are using the C API, you can get information about the query by
calling the API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> when the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>
query finishes.  The format of the information string is shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
</PRE>

<P>
Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted
via the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (see section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.2  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>), except
that <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> also generates warnings when there are too few
or too many fields in the input row.  The warnings are not stored anywhere;
the number of warnings can only be used as an indication if everything went
well.  If you get warnings and want to know exactly why you got them, one way
to do this is to use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> into another file and
compare this to your original input file.

</P>
<P>
If you need <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to read from a pipe, you can use the
following trick:

</P>

<PRE>
mkfifo /mysql/db/x/x
chmod 666 /mysql/db/x/x
cat &#60; /dev/tcp/10.1.1.12/4711 &#62; /nt/mysql/db/x/x
mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'x' INTO TABLE x" x
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a version of MySQL older than 3.23.25
you can only do the above with <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and speeding up <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>,

DO expression, [expression, ...]

<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> creates a database with the given name.  Rules for
allowable database names are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>.  An error occurs if
the database already exists and you didn't specify <CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Databases in MySQL are implemented as directories containing files
that correspond to tables in the database.  Because there are no tables in a

VERY careful with this command!</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> returns the number of files that were removed from
the database directory.  Normally, this is three times the number of

creates a table with the given name in the current database.  Rules for
allowable table names are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>.  An error occurs if
there is no current database or if the table already exists.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword when
you create a table.  A temporary table will automatically be deleted if a
connection dies and the name is per connection.  This means that two different
connections can both use the same temporary table name without conflicting
with each other or with an existing table of the same name. (The existing table
is hidden until the temporary table is deleted).

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can use the keywords
<CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> so that an error does not occur if the table already
exists.  Note that there is no verification that the table structures are
identical.

<P>
For more information on the properties of the various column types, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If neither <CODE>NULL</CODE> nor <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> is specified, the column
is treated as though <CODE>NULL</CODE> had been specified.

<LI>

An integer column may have the additional attribute <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>.
When you insert a value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> (recommended) or <CODE>0</CODE> into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the column is set to <CODE>value+1</CODE>, where
<CODE>value</CODE> is the largest value for the column currently in the table.
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> sequences begin with <CODE>1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

If you delete the row containing the maximum value for an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the value will be reused with an
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>, or <CODE>BDB</CODE> table but not with a
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table.  If you delete all rows in the table
with <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> (without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>) in
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, the sequence starts over for all table types.

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> There can be only one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column per
table, and it must be indexed. MySQL Version 3.23 will also only
work properly if the auto_increment column only has positive
values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large
positive number.  This is done to avoid precision problems when
numbers 'wrap' over from positive to negative and also to ensure that one
doesn't accidentally get an auto_increment column that contains 0.

<A NAME="IDX1361"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1362"></A>
To make MySQL compatible with some ODBC applications, you can find
the last inserted row with the following query:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled differently for <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns than
for other column types.  You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the
current date and time.  Because <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the
<CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> attributes do not apply in the normal way and
are ignored if you specify them.

On the other hand, to make it easier for MySQL clients to use
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, the server reports that such columns may be
assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (which is true), even though <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
never actually will contain a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  You can see this when you
use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to get a description of your table.

Note that setting a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>0</CODE> is not the same
as setting it to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, because <CODE>0</CODE> is a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
value.

<LI>

If no <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value is specified for a column, MySQL
automatically assigns one.

If the column may take <CODE>NULL</CODE> as a value, the default value is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

If the column is declared as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value depends on
the column type:


<UL>
<LI>

For numeric types other than those declared with the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
attribute, the default is <CODE>0</CODE>.  For an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the
default value is the next value in the sequence.

<LI>

For date and time types other than <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, the default is the
appropriate zero value for the type.  For the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column in a table, the default value is the current date and time.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

<LI>

For string types other than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default value is the empty string.
For <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default is the first enumeration value.
</UL>

Default values must be constants. This means, for example, that you cannot
set the default for a date column to be the value of a function such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>KEY</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>INDEX</CODE>.

<LI>

In MySQL, a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key can have only distinct values. An
error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key that matches an existing
row.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1363"></A>
A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is a unique <CODE>KEY</CODE> with the extra constraint
that all key columns must be defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.  In MySQL
the key is named <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>. A table can have only one <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.
If you don't have a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> and some applications ask for the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in your tables, MySQL will return the first
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key, which doesn't have any <CODE>NULL</CODE> columns, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<LI>

A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> can be a multiple-column index.  However, you cannot
create a multiple-column index using the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> key attibute in a
column specification.  Doing so will mark only that single column as primary.
You must use the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY(index_col_name, ...)</CODE> syntax.

<LI>

If the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key consists of only one column and this
is of type integer, you can also refer to it as <CODE>_rowid</CODE>
(new in Version 3.23.11).

<LI>

If you don't assign a name to an index, the index will be assigned the same
name as the first <CODE>index_col_name</CODE>, with an optional suffix (<CODE>_2</CODE>,
<CODE>_3</CODE>, <CODE>...</CODE>) to make it unique.  You can see index names for a
table using <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.5  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1364"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1365"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports indexes on columns that can have
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values. In other cases you must declare such columns
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> or an error results.

<LI>

With <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax, you can specify an index that
uses only a part of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column. This can
make the index file much smaller.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Indexes">5.4.4  Column Indexes</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1366"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1367"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1368"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1369"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports indexing on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.  When putting an index on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
column you MUST always specify the length of the index:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, index(blob_col(10)));
</PRE>

<LI>

When you use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> or
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column, only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes are used.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<STRONG>FULLTEXT</STRONG> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be created
only from <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column, partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details of operation.

<LI>

The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> clauses don't
actually do anything.  The syntax for them is provided only for compatibility,
to make it easier to port code from other SQL servers and to run applications
that create tables with references.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Missing_functions">1.4.4  Functionality Missing from MySQL</A>.

<LI>

Each <CODE>NULL</CODE> column takes one bit extra, rounded up to the nearest byte.

<LI>

The maximum record length in bytes can be calculated as follows:


<PRE>
row length = 1
             + (sum of column lengths)
             + (number of NULL columns + 7)/8
             + (number of variable-length columns)
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>table_options</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> options are only
implemented in MySQL Version 3.23 and above.

The different table types are:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>BDB or Berkeley_db </TD><TD> Transaction-safe tables with page locking. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.5  BDB or Berkeley_DB Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>HEAP </TD><TD> The data for this table is only stored in memory. See section <A HREF="manual.html#HEAP">7.4  HEAP Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ISAM </TD><TD> The original table handler. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ISAM">7.3  ISAM Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>InnoDB </TD><TD> Transaction-safe tables with row locking. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.6  InnoDB Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>MERGE </TD><TD> A collection of MyISAM tables used as one table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  MERGE Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>MyISAM </TD><TD> The new binary portable table handler that is replacing ISAM. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  MyISAM Tables</A>.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

If a table type is specified, and that particular type is not available,
MySQL will choose the closest table type to the one that you have
specified.  For example, if <CODE>TYPE=BDB</CODE> is specified, and that distribution
of MySQL does not support <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, the table will be created
as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> instead.

The other table options are used to optimize the behavior of the
table. In most cases, you don't have to specify any of them.
The options work for all table types, if not otherwise indicated:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> The next auto_increment value you want to set for your table (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> </TD><TD> An approximation of the average row length for your table. You only need to set this for large tables with variable size records.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CHECKSUM</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want MySQL to maintain a checksum for all rows (makes the table a little slower to update but makes it easier to find corrupted tables) (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>COMMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> A 60-character comment for your table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Max number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MIN_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Minimum number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want to have a smaller index. This usually makes updates slower and reads faster (MyISAM, ISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PASSWORD</CODE> </TD><TD> Encrypt the <CODE>.frm</CODE> file with a password.  This option doesn't do anything in the standard MySQL version.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if want to delay key table updates until the table is closed (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>ROW_FORMAT</CODE> </TD><TD> Defines how the rows should be stored. Currently you can only use the DYNAMIC and STATIC options for MyISAM tables.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

When you use a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, MySQL uses the product of
<CODE>max_rows * avg_row_length</CODE> to decide how big the resulting table
will be.  If you don't specify any of the above options, the maximum size
for a table will be 4G (or 2G if your operating systems only supports 2G
tables). The reason for this is just to keep down the pointer sizes
to make the index smaller and faster if you don't really need big files.

If you don't use <CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE>, the default is to only pack strings,
not numbers.  If you use <CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE>, numbers will be packed as well.

When packing binary number keys, MySQL will use prefix compression.
This means that you will only get a big benefit of this if you have
many numbers that are the same.  Prefix compression means that every
key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the previous key are
the same for the next key (note that the pointer to the row is stored
in high-byte-first-order directly after the key, to improve
compression.)  This means that if you have many equal keys on two rows
in a row, all following 'same' keys will usually only take 2 bytes
(including the pointer to the row).  Compare this to the ordinary case
where the following keys will take storage_size_for_key +
pointer_size (usually 4).  On the other hand, if all keys are
totally different, you will lose 1 byte per key, if the key isn't a
key that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (In this case the packed key length will
be stored in the same byte that is used to mark if a key is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.)

<LI>

If you specify a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> after the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement,
MySQL will create new fields for all elements in the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (a int not null auto_increment,
           primary key (a), key(b))
           TYPE=MyISAM SELECT b,c from test2;
</PRE>

This will create a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table with three columns, a, b, and c.
Notice that the columns from the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement are appended to
the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it.  Take the following
example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from foo;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+           

mysql&#62; create table bar (m int) select n from foo;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
 
mysql&#62; select * from bar;
+------+---+
| m    | n |
+------+---+
| NULL | 1 |
+------+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)                           
</PRE>

For each row in table <CODE>foo</CODE>, a row is inserted in <CODE>bar</CODE> with
the values from <CODE>foo</CODE> and default values for the new columns.

<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</CODE> will not automatically create any indexes
for you.  This is done intentionally to make the command as flexible as
possible.  If you want to have indexes in the created table, you should
specify these before the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; create table bar (unique (n)) select n from foo;
</PRE>

If any errors occur while copying the data to the table, it will 
automatically be deleted. 

To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
<CODE>CREATE TABLE .... SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

The <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> option will help you to break the 2G/4G limit for
the MyISAM data file (not the index file) on
operating systems that don't support big files. You can get also more speed
from the I/O bottleneck by putting <CODE>RAID</CODE> directories on different
physical disks. <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> will work on any OS, as long as you have
configured MySQL with <CODE>--with-raid</CODE>.  For now the only allowed
<CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> is <CODE>STRIPED</CODE> (<CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>RAID0</CODE> are aliases
for this).

If you specify <CODE>RAID_TYPE=STRIPED</CODE> for a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create <CODE>RAID_CHUNKS</CODE> subdirectories named 00,
01, 02 in the database directory.  In each of these directories
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create a <CODE>table_name.MYD</CODE>.  When writing data
to the data file, the <CODE>RAID</CODE> handler will map the first
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the first file, the next
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the next file and so on.
<LI>

<CODE>UNION</CODE> is used when you want to use a collection of identical
tables as one. This only works with MERGE tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  MERGE Tables</A>.

For the moment you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
All mapped tables must be in the same database as the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
<LI>

In the created table the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> key will be placed first, followed
by all <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys and then the normal keys.  This helps the
MySQL optimizer to prioritize which key to use and also more quickly
detect duplicated <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.

<LI>

By using <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> or <CODE>INDEX
DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> you can specify where the table handler should
put it's table and index files.  This only works for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables
in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0, when you are not using the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

In some cases, MySQL silently changes a column specification from
that given in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  (This may also occur with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns with a length less than four are changed to
<CODE>CHAR</CODE>.

<LI>

If any column in a table has a variable length, the entire row is
variable-length as a result.  Therefore, if a table contains any
variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>),
all <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns longer than three characters are changed to
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.  This doesn't affect how you use the columns in
any way; in MySQL, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is just a different way to
store characters.  MySQL performs this conversion because it
saves space and makes table operations faster.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> display sizes must be even and in the range from 2 to 14.
If you specify a display size of 0 or greater than 14, the size is coerced
to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to 13 are coerced
to the next higher even number.

<LI>

You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting
it to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the current date and time.  Because
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>
attributes do not apply in the normal way and are ignored if you specify
them.  <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> always reports that a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column may be assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.

<LI>

MySQL maps certain column types used by other SQL database vendors

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> allows you to change the structure of an existing table.
For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change
the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself.  You can
also change the comment for the table and type of the table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to change a column specification but
<CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> indicates that your column was not changed, it is
possible that MySQL ignored your modification for one of the reasons
described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.  For example, if you try to change
a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, MySQL will still use
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> if the table contains other variable-length columns.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works by making a temporary copy of the original table.
The alteration is performed on the copy, then the original table is
deleted and the new one is renamed. This is done in such a way that
all updates are automatically redirected to the new table without
any failed updates. While <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> is executing, the original
table is readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table
are stalled until the new table is ready.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you use any other option to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> than
<CODE>RENAME</CODE>, MySQL will always create a temporary table, even
if the data wouldn't strictly need to be copied (like when you change the
name of a column). We plan to fix this in the future, but as one doesn't
normally do <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> that often this isn't that high on our TODO.

<CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.
It controls how <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works if there are duplicates on

<CODE>tbl_name</CODE>.  There is no need to create the temporary table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#RENAME_TABLE">6.5.5  <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>create_definition</CODE> clauses use the same syntax for <CODE>ADD</CODE> and
<CODE>CHANGE</CODE> as for <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  Note that this syntax includes
the column name, not just the column type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can rename a column using a <CODE>CHANGE old_col_name create_definition</CODE>
clause.  To do so, specify the old and new column names and the type that
the column currently has.  For example, to rename an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> column
from <CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>b</CODE>, you can do this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b INTEGER;
</PRE>

If you want to change a column's type but not the name, <CODE>CHANGE</CODE>
syntax still requires two column names even if they are the same.  For
example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

However, as of MySQL Version 3.22.16a, you can also use <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>
to change a column's type without renaming it:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

<LI>

If you use <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE> to shorten a column for which
an index exists on part of the column (for instance, if you have an index
on the first 10 characters of a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column), you cannot make
the column shorter than the number of characters that are indexed.

<LI>

When you change a column type using <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>,
MySQL tries to convert data to the new type as well as possible.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use <CODE>FIRST</CODE> or
<CODE>ADD ... AFTER col_name</CODE> to add a column at a specific position within
a table row. The default is to add the column last.

<A NAME="IDX1373"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER COLUMN</CODE> specifies a new default value for a column
or removes the old default value.
If the old default is removed and the column can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the new
default is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If the column cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, MySQL
assigns a default value, as described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1374"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> removes an index. This is a MySQL extension to
ANSI SQL92. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DROP_INDEX">6.5.8  <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If columns are dropped from a table, the columns are also removed from any
index of which they are a part.  If all columns that make up an index are
dropped, the index is dropped as well.

<LI>

If a table contains only one column, the column cannot be dropped.
If what you intend is to remove the table, use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> instead.

<A NAME="IDX1375"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP PRIMARY KEY</CODE> drops the primary index. If no such
index exists, it drops the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index in the table.
(MySQL marks the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key as the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>
if no <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> was specified explicitly.)

<A NAME="IDX1376"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1377"></A>
If you add a <CODE>UNIQUE INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> to a table, this
is stored before any not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index so that MySQL can detect
duplicate keys as early as possible.

<A NAME="IDX1378"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> allows you to create the new table with the rows in a
specific order.  Note that the table will not remain in this order after
inserts and deletes.  In some cases, it may make sorting easier for
MySQL if the table is in order by the column that you wish to
order it by later.  This option is mainly useful when you know that you
are mostly going to query the rows in a certain order; By using this
option after big changes to the table, you may be able to get higher
performance.

<A NAME="IDX1379"></A>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, all non-unique
indexes are created in a separate batch (like in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).
This should make <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> much faster when you have many indexes.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1380"></A>
With the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>, you can find out how many
records were copied, and (when <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is used) how many records were
deleted due to duplication of unique key values.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1381"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1382"></A>
The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> clauses don't
actually do anything.  The syntax for them is provided only for compatibility,
to make it easier to port code from other SQL servers and to run applications
that create tables with references.

<P>
Here is an example that shows some of the uses of <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.  We
begin with a table <CODE>t1</CODE> that is created as shown below:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t1 (a INTEGER,b CHAR(10));
</PRE>

<P>
To rename the table from <CODE>t1</CODE> to <CODE>t2</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME t2;
</PRE>

<P>
To change column <CODE>a</CODE> from <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> to <CODE>TINYINT NOT NULL</CODE>
(leaving the name the same), and to change column <CODE>b</CODE> from
<CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR(20)</CODE> as well as renaming it from <CODE>b</CODE> to
<CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 MODIFY a TINYINT NOT NULL, CHANGE b c CHAR(20);
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column named <CODE>d</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD d TIMESTAMP;
</PRE>

<P>
To add an index on column <CODE>d</CODE>, and make column <CODE>a</CODE> the primary key:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD INDEX (d), ADD PRIMARY KEY (a);
</PRE>

<P>
To remove column <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c;
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> integer column named <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
           ADD INDEX (c);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we indexed <CODE>c</CODE>, because <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns must be
indexed, and also that we declare <CODE>c</CODE> as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, because
indexed columns cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you add an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, column values are filled in
with sequence numbers for you automatically.  You can set the first
sequence number by executing <CODE>SET INSERT_ID=#</CODE> before
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or using the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT = #</CODE> table option.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
With MyISAM tables, if you don't change the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the sequence number will not be affected. If you drop an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column and then add another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the numbers will start from 1 again.

<A NAME="IDX1383"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_table_name[, tbl_name2 TO new_table_name2,...]
</PRE>

<P>
The rename is done atomically, which means that no other thread can
access any of the tables while the rename is running. This makes it
possible to replace a table with an empty one:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE new_table (...);
RENAME TABLE old_table TO backup_table, new_table TO old_table;
</PRE>

<P>
The rename is done from left to right, which means that if you want to
swap two tables names, you have to:

</P>

<PRE>
RENAME TABLE old_table    TO backup_table,
             new_table    TO old_table,
             backup_table TO new_table;
</PRE>

<P>
As long as two databases are on the same disk you can also rename
from one database to another:

</P>

<PRE>
RENAME TABLE current_database.table_name TO other_database.table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
When you execute <CODE>RENAME</CODE>, you can't have any locked tables or
active transactions.  You must also have the <CODE>ALTER</CODE> and <CODE>DROP</CODE>
privilege on the original table and <CODE>CREATE</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
privilege on the new table.

</P>
<P>
If MySQL encounters any errors in a multiple table rename, it
will do a reverse rename for all renamed tables to get everything back
to the original state.

CREATE [UNIQUE|FULLTEXT] INDEX index_name ON tbl_name (col_name[(length)],... )
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> statement doesn't do anything in MySQL prior
to Version 3.22.  In Version 3.22 or later, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> is mapped to an
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement to create indexes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself
is created with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> allows you to add indexes to existing tables.

</P>
<P>
A column list of the form <CODE>(col1,col2,...)</CODE> creates a multiple-column
index.  Index values are formed by concatenating the values of the given
columns.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, indexes can be created that
use only part of a column, using <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax.  (On
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns the length is required). The
statement shown below creates an index using the first 10 characters of
the <CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));
</PRE>

<P>
Because most names usually differ in the first 10 characters, this index should
not be much slower than an index created from the entire <CODE>name</CODE> column.
Also, using partial columns for indexes can make the index file much smaller,
which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations!

</P>
<P>
Note that you can only add an index on a column that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values or on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column if you are using
MySQL Version 3.23.2 or newer and are using the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table type.

For more information about how MySQL uses indexes, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes can index only <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, and only in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes
are available in MySQL Version 3.23.23 and later.

By default, MySQL runs in <CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode. This means that
as soon as you execute an update, MySQL will store the update on
disk.

</P>
<P>
If you are using transactions safe tables (like <CODE>BDB</CODE>,
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, you can put MySQL into
non-<CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0
</PRE>

<P>
After this you must use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> to store your changes to disk or
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> if you want to ignore the changes you have made since
the beginning of your transaction.

</P>
<P>
If you want to switch from <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode for one series of
statements, you can use the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> or <CODE>BEGIN WORK</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
BEGIN;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summmary=@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you are using non-transaction-safe tables, the changes will be
stored at once, independent of the status of the <CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode.

</P>
<P>
If you do a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> when you have updated a non-transactional
table you will get an error (<CODE>ER_WARNING_NOT_COMPLETE_ROLLBACK</CODE>) as
a warning.  All transactional safe tables will be restored but any
non-transactional table will not change.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you
should use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the
older update log.  Transactions are stored in the binary log
in one chunk, upon <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, to ensure that transactions which are
rolled back are not stored.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.

LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ | [READ LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE}
            [, tbl_name {READ | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE} ...]
...
UNLOCK TABLES
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> locks tables for the current thread.  <CODE>UNLOCK
TABLES</CODE> releases any locks held by the current thread.  All tables that
are locked by the current thread are automatically unlocked when the
thread issues another <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, or when the connection to the
server is closed.

</P>
<P>
The main reasons to use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> are for emulating transactions
or getting more speed when updating tables.  This is explained in more
detail later.

</P>
<P>
If a thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock on a table, that thread (and all other
threads) can only read from the table. If a thread obtains a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>
lock on a table, then only the thread holding the lock can <CODE>READ</CODE> from
or <CODE>WRITE</CODE> to the table.  Other threads are blocked.

</P>
<P>
The difference between <CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> and <CODE>READ</CODE> is that
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> allows non-conflicting <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to
execute while the lock is held.  This can't however be used if you are
going to manipulate the database files outside MySQL while you
hold the lock.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, you must lock all tables that you are
going to use and you must use the same alias that you are going to use
in your queries!  If you are using a table multiple times in a query
(with aliases), you must get a lock for each alias!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks normally have higher priority than <CODE>READ</CODE> locks, to
ensure that updates are processed as soon as possible. This means that if one
thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock and then another thread requests a
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock, subsequent <CODE>READ</CODE> lock requests will wait until the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> thread has gotten the lock and released it.  You can use
<CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks to allow other threads to obtain <CODE>READ</CODE>
locks while the thread is waiting for the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock. You should only
use <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks if you are sure that there will
eventually be a time when no threads will have a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works as follows:

<OL>
<LI>

Sort all tables to be locked in a internally defined order (from the
user standpoint the order is undefined).
<LI>

If a table is locked with a read and a write lock, put the write lock
before the read lock.
<LI>

Lock one table at a time until the thread gets all locks.
</OL>

<P>
This policy ensures that table locking is deadlock free. There is
however other things one needs to be aware of with this schema:

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY_WRITE</CODE> lock for a table, this
means only that MySQL will wait for this particlar lock until
there is no threads that wants a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.  When the thread has
got the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock and is waiting to get the lock for the next
table in the lock table list, all other threads will wait for the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock to be released.  If this becomes a serious problem
with your application, you should consider converting some of your
tables to transactions safe tables.

</P>
<P>
You can safely kill a thread that is waiting for a table lock with
<CODE>KILL</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.4  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that you should <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> lock any tables that you are using with
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This is because that in this case the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
is done by a separate thread.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements
are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any other currently executing
SQL statement. There are a few cases when you would like to lock tables
anyway:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are going to run many operations on a bunch of tables, it's much
faster to lock the tables you are going to use.  The downside is, of course,
that no other thread can update a <CODE>READ</CODE>-locked table and no other
thread can read a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>-locked table.

The reason some things are faster under <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> is that
MySQL will not flush the key cache for the locked tables until
<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> is called (normally the key cache is flushed after
each SQL statement). This speeds up inserting/updateing/deletes on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

If you are using a table handler in MySQL that doesn't support 
transactions, you must use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> if you want to ensure that 
no other thread comes between a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>. The 
example shown below requires <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in order to execute safely:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
mysql&#62; select sum(value) from trans where customer_id= some_id;
mysql&#62; update customer set total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
           where customer_id=some_id;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

Without <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, there is a chance that another thread might
insert a new row in the <CODE>trans</CODE> table between execution of the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.
</UL>

<P>
By using incremental updates (<CODE>UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value</CODE>) or the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function, you can
avoid using <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in many cases.

</P>

You can also solve some cases by using the user-level lock functions
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> and <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.  These locks are saved in a hash
table in the server and implemented with <CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and
<CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> for high speed.

Since Version 3.23.23, MySQL has support for full-text indexing
and searching.  Full-text indexes in MySQL are an index of type 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>.  <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes can be created from <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> 
and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns at <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> time or added later with 
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>.  For large datasets, adding 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> (or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>) would 
be much faster than inserting rows into the empty table with a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> 
index.

</P>
<P>
Full-text search is performed with the <CODE>MATCH</CODE> function.

<P>
The function <CODE>MATCH</CODE> matches a natural language query <CODE>AGAINST</CODE> 
a text collection (which is simply the set of columns covered by a 
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index).  For every row in a table it returns relevance - 
a similarity measure between the text in that row (in the columns that are 
part of the collection) and the query.  When it is used in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> 
clause (see example above) the rows returned are automatically sorted with 
relevance decreasing.  Relevance is a non-negative floating-point number. 
Zero relevance means no similarity.  Relevance is computed based on the 
number of words in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the 
total number of words in the collection, and the number of documents (rows) 
that contain a particular word.

</P>
<P>
The above is a basic example of using <CODE>MATCH</CODE> function. Rows are
returned with relevance decreasing.

</PRE>

<P>
This is more complex example - the query returns the relevance and still
sorts the rows with relevance decreasing. To achieve it one should specify
<CODE>MATCH</CODE> twice. Note, that this will cause no additional overhead, as
MySQL optimizer will notice that these two <CODE>MATCH</CODE> calls are
identical and will call full-text search code only once.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A
``word'' is any sequence of letters, numbers, <SAMP>`''</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  Any
``word'' that is present in the stopword list or just too short (3
characters or less) is ignored.

</P>
<P>
Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted,
according to its significance in the query or collection.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents will have lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Otherwise, if the word is rare, it will receive a
higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute the
relevance of the row.

</P>
<P>
Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not reflect adequately their semantical value, and this model
may sometimes produce bizarre results.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
Search for the word <CODE>MySQL</CODE> produces no results in the above example.
Word <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is present in more than half of rows, and as such, is
effectively treated as a stopword (that is, with semantical value zero). 
It is, really, the desired behavior - a natural language query should not
return every second row in 1GB table.

</P>
<P>
A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate relevant
documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of irrelevant documents.
We all know this happens far too often when we are trying to find something on
the Internet with a search engine.  It is with this reasoning that such rows 
have been assigned a low semantical value in <STRONG>this particular dataset</STRONG>.

somewhat alter the full-text search behavior.

</P>

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL Version 3.23.6, you can choose between three basic
table formats (<CODE>ISAM</CODE>, <CODE>HEAP</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  Newer
MySQL may support additional table type (<CODE>BDB</CODE>,
or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>), depending on how you compile it.
 
When you create a new table, you can tell MySQL which table
type it should use for the table.  MySQL will always create a
<CODE>.frm</CODE> file to hold the table and column definitions.  Depending on
the table type, the index and data will be stored in other files.

</P>
<P>
Note that to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables you have to use at least
the <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> startup option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.6.2  InnoDB startup options</A>.

</P>
<P>
The default table type in MySQL is <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. If you are
trying to use a table type that is not compiled-in or activated,
MySQL will instead create a table of type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  This
is a very useful feature when you want to copy tables between different
SQL servers that supports different table types (like copying tables to
a slave that is optimized for speed by not having transactional tables).
This automatic table changing can however also be very confusing for new
MySQL users. We plan to fix this by introducing warnings in
MySQL 4.0 and giving a warning when a table type is automatically
changed.

</P>
<P>
You can convert tables between different types with the <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL supports two different kinds of
tables. Transaction-safe tables (<CODE>BDB</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
and not transaction-safe tables (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>, <CODE>ISAM</CODE>,
<CODE>MERGE</CODE>, and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Advantages of transaction-safe tables (TST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Safer. Even if MySQL crashes or you get hardware problems, you
can get your data back, either by automatic recovery or from a backup
+ the transaction log.
<LI>

You can combine many statements and accept these all in one go with
the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> command.
<LI>

You can execute <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to ignore your changes (if you are not
running in auto commit mode).
<LI>

If an update fails, all your changes will be restored. (With NTST tables all
changes that have taken place are permanent)
</UL>

<P>
Advantages of not transaction-safe tables (NTST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Much faster as there is no transaction overhead.
<LI>

Will use less disk space as there is no overhead of transactions.
<LI>

Will use less memory to do updates.
</UL>

<P>
You can combine TST and NTST tables in the same statements to get the best
of both worlds.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="MyISAM" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM">7.1  MyISAM Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is the default table type in MySQL Version 3.23. It's
based on the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> code and has a lot of useful extensions.

</P>
<P>
The index is stored in a file with the <CODE>.MYI</CODE> (MYIndex) extension,
and the data is stored in a file with the <CODE>.MYD</CODE> (MYData) extension.
You can check/repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>. You can compress <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with 
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to take up much less space. See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following is new in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There is a flag in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> file that indicates whether or not
the table was closed correctly.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is started with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables will automatically be
checked and/or repaired on open if the table wasn't closed properly.
<LI>

You can <CODE>INSERT</CODE> new rows in a table that doesn't have free blocks
in the middle of the data file, at the same time other threads are
reading from the table (concurrent insert).  An free block can come from
an update of a dynamic length row with much data to a row with less data
or when deleting rows. When all free blocks are used up, all future
inserts will be concurrent again.
<LI>

Support for big files (63-bit) on filesystems/operating systems that
support big files.
<LI>

All data is stored with the low byte first. This makes the data machine
and OS independent. The only requirement is that the machine uses
two's-complement signed integers (as every machine for the last 20 years
has) and IEEE floating-point format (also totally dominant among
mainstream machines). The only area of machines that may not support
binary compatibility are embedded systems (because they sometimes have
peculiar processors).

There is no big speed penalty in storing data low byte first; The bytes
in a table row is normally unaligned and it doesn't take that much more
power to read an unaligned byte in order than in reverse order.  The
actual fetch-column-value code is also not time critical compared to
other code.
<LI>

All number keys are stored with high byte first to give better index
compression.
<LI>

Internal handling of one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column. <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
will automatically update this on <CODE>INSERT/UPDATE</CODE>. The
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value can be reset with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. This
will make <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns faster (at least 10 %) and old
numbers will not be reused as with the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE>. Note that when an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> is defined on the end of a multi-part-key the old
behavior is still present.
<LI>

When inserted in sorted order (as when you are using an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column) the key tree will be split so that the high node only contains one
key. This will improve the space utilization in the key tree.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns can be indexed.
<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are allowed in indexed columns.  This takes 0-1
bytes/key.
<LI>

Maximum key length is 500 bytes by default (can be changed by
recompiling).  In cases of keys longer than 250 bytes, a bigger key
block size than the default of 1024 bytes is used for this key.
<LI>

Maximum number of keys/table is 32 as default. This can be enlarged to 64 
without having to recompile <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will mark tables as checked if one runs it with
<CODE>--update-state</CODE>. <CODE>myisamchk --fast</CODE> will only check those
tables that don't have this mark.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> stores statistics for key parts (and not only for
whole keys as in <CODE>ISAM</CODE>).
<LI>

Dynamic size rows will now be much less fragmented when mixing deletes
with updates and inserts.  This is done by automatically combining adjacent
deleted blocks and by extending blocks if the next block is deleted.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.
<LI>

You can use put the datafile and index file on different directories
to get more speed (with the <CODE>DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY="path"</CODE> option to
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>). See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> also supports the following things, which MySQL
will be able to use in the near future:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Support for a true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> type; A <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column starts
with a length stored in 2 bytes.
<LI>

Tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> may have fixed or dynamic record length.
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> may be up to 64K.
All key segments have their own language definition. This will enable
MySQL to have different language definitions per column.
<LI>

A hashed computed index can be used for <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>. This will allow
you to have <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> on any combination of columns in a table. (You
can't search on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> computed index, however.)
</UL>

<P>
Note that index files are usually much smaller with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> than with
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>. This means that <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will normally use less
system resources than <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, but will need more CPU when inserting
data into a compressed index.

</P>
<P>
The following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be used to change the behavior of
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.5.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1416"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL can support different index types, but the normal type is
ISAM or MyISAM.  These use a B-tree index, and you can roughly calculate
the size for the index file as <CODE>(key_length+4)/0.67</CODE>, summed over
all keys.  (This is for the worst case when all keys are inserted in
sorted order and we don't have any compressed keys.)

</P>
<P>
String indexes are space compressed. If the first index part is a
string, it will also be prefix compressed.  Space compression makes the
index file smaller than the above figures if the string column has a lot
of trailing space or is a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that is not always used
to the full length. Prefix compression is used on keys that start
with a string.  Prefix compression helps if there are many strings
with an identical prefix.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can also prefix compress numbers by specifying
<CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE> when you create the table.  This helps when you have
many integer keys that have an identical prefix when the numbers are stored
high-byte first.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MyISAM_table_formats" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  MyISAM Table Formats</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>MyISAM</STRONG> supports 3 different table types. Two of them are chosen
automatically depending on the type of columns you are using. The third,
compressed tables, can only be created with the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> tool.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Static_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Static_format">7.1.2.1  Static (Fixed-length) Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
This is the default format. It's used when the table contains no
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
This format is the simplest and most secure format. It is also the
fastest of the on-disk formats. The speed comes from the easy way data
can be found on disk. When looking up something with an index and static
format it is very simple. Just multiply the row number by the row length.

</P>
<P>
Also, when scanning a table it is very easy to read a constant number of
records with each disk read.

</P>
<P>
The security is evidenced if your computer crashes when writing to a
fixed-size MyISAM file, in which case <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can easily figure out where each
row starts and ends. So it can usually reclaim all records except the
partially written one. Note that in MySQL all indexes can always be
reconstructed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>, and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> columns are space-padded
to the column width.
<LI>

Very quick.
<LI>

Easy to cache.
<LI>

Easy to reconstruct after a crash, because records are located in fixed
positions.
<LI>

Doesn't have to be reorganized (with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>) unless a huge number of
records are deleted and you want to return free disk space to the operating
system.
<LI>

Usually requires more disk space than dynamic tables.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Dynamic_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Dynamic_format">7.1.2.2  Dynamic Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1417"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1418"></A>

</P>
<P>
This format is used if the table contains any <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>,
or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns or if the table was created with
<CODE>ROW_FORMAT=dynamic</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This format is a little more complex because each row has to have a header
that says how long it is. One record can also end up at more than one
location when it is made longer at an update.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1419"></A>
You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE table</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to defragment a
table. If you have static data that you access/change a lot in the same
table as some <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, it might be a good
idea to move the dynamic columns to other tables just to avoid
fragmentation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All string columns are dynamic (except those with a length less than 4).
<LI>

Each record is preceded by a bitmap indicating which columns are empty
(<CODE>''</CODE>) for string columns, or zero for numeric columns. (This isn't
the same as columns containing <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.) If a string column
has a length of zero after removal of trailing spaces, or a numeric
column has a value of zero, it is marked in the bit map and not saved to
disk.  Non-empty strings are saved as a length byte plus the string
contents.
<LI>

Usually takes much less disk space than fixed-length tables.
<LI>

Each record uses only as much space as is required. If a record becomes
larger, it is split into as many pieces as are required.  This results in record
fragmentation.
<LI>

If you update a row with information that extends the row length, the
row will be fragmented.  In this case, you may have to run <CODE>myisamchk
-r</CODE> from time to time to get better performance.  Use <CODE>myisamchk -ei
tbl_name</CODE> for some statistics.
<LI>

Not as easy to reconstruct after a crash, because a record may be fragmented
into many pieces and a link (fragment) may be missing.
<LI>

The expected row length for dynamic sized records is:


<PRE>
3
+ (number of columns + 7) / 8
+ (number of char columns)
+ packed size of numeric columns
+ length of strings
+ (number of NULL columns + 7) / 8
</PRE>

There is a penalty of 6 bytes for each link. A dynamic record is linked
whenever an update causes an enlargement of the record. Each new link will be
at least 20 bytes, so the next enlargement will probably go in the same link.
If not, there will be another link. You may check how many links there are
with <CODE>myisamchk -ed</CODE>. All links may be removed with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
This is a read-only type that is generated with the optional
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> tool (<CODE>pack_isam</CODE> for <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All MySQL distributions, even those that existed before MySQL
went GPL, can read tables that were compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.
<LI>

Compressed tables take very little disk space. This minimizes disk usage, which
is very nice when using slow disks (like CD-ROMs).
<LI>

Each record is compressed separately (very little access overhead).  The
header for a record is fixed (1-3 bytes) depending on the biggest record in the
table.  Each column is compressed differently. Some of the compression types
are:

<UL>
<LI>

There is usually a different Huffman table for each column.
<LI>

Suffix space compression.
<LI>

Prefix space compression.
<LI>

Numbers with value <CODE>0</CODE> are stored using 1 bit.
<LI>

If values in an integer column have a small range, the column is stored using
the smallest possible type. For example, a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column (8 bytes) may
be stored as a <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> column (1 byte) if all values are in the range
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>.
<LI>

If a column has only a small set of possible values, the column type is
converted to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>.
<LI>

A column may use a combination of the above compressions.
</UL>

<LI>

to become corrupted.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Corrupted_MyISAM_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Corrupted_MyISAM_tables">7.1.3.1  Corrupted MyISAM tables.</A></H4>

<P>
Even if the MyISAM table format is very reliable (all changes to a table
is written before the SQL statements returns) , you can still get
corrupted tables if some of the following things happens:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process being killed in the middle of a write.
<LI>

Unexpected shutdown of the computer (for example, if the computer is turned
off).
<LI>

A hardware error.
<LI>

You are using an external program (like myisamchk) on a live table.
<LI>

A software bug in the MySQL or MyISAM code.
</UL>

<P>
Typial typical symptoms for a corrupt table is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You get the error <CODE>Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to repair it</CODE>
while selecting data from the table.
<LI>

Queries doesn't find rows in the table or returns incomplete data.
</UL>

<P>
You can check if a table is ok with the command <CODE>CHECK
TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can repair a corrupted table with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You can also repair a table, when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running with
the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command. <CODE>myisamchk syntax</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If your tables get corrupted a lot you should try to find the reason for
this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>. 

</P>
<P>
In this case the most important thing to know is if the table got
corrupted if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died (one can easily verify this by
checking if there is a recent row <CODE>restarted mysqld</CODE> in the mysqld
error file).  If this isn't the case, then you should try to make a test
case of this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">G.1.6  Making a test case when you experience table corruption</A>.

<H4><A NAME="MyISAM_table_close" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM_table_close">7.1.3.2  Clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly</A></H4>

<P>
Each <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> <CODE>.MYI</CODE> file has in the header a counter that can
be used to check if a table has been closed properly.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following warning from <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
# clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
</PRE>

<P>
this means that this counter has come out of sync.  This doesn't mean
that the table is corrupted, but means that you should at least do a
check on the table to verify that it's ok.

</P>
<P>
The counter works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first time a table is updated in MySQL, a counter in the
header of the index files is incremented.
<LI>

The counter is not changed during further updates.
<LI>

When the last instance of a table is closed (because of a <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> or
because there isn't room in the table cache) the counter is
decremented if the table has been updated at any point.
<LI>

When you repair the table or check the table and it was ok,
the counter is reset to 0.
<LI>

To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that may do a
check on the table, the counter is not decremented on close if it was 0.
</UL>

<P>
In other words, the only ways this can go out of sync are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are copied without a <CODE>LOCK</CODE> and
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close
(Note that the table may still be ok, as MySQL always issues writes
for everything between each statement).
<LI>

Someone has done a <CODE>myisamchk --repair</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk
--update-state</CODE>on a table that was in use by <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers are using the table and one has done a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK</CODE> of the table while it was in use by
another server.  In this setup the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> is safe to do (even if
you will get the warning from other servers), but <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> should
be avoided as it currently replaces the data file with a new one, which
is not signaled to the other servers.

<H2><A NAME="MERGE" HREF="manual_toc.html#MERGE">7.2  MERGE Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1421"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1422"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are new in MySQL Version 3.23.25. The code
is still in gamma, but should be resonable stable.

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table is a collection of identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables
that can be used as one.  You can only <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> from the collection of tables.  If you <CODE>DROP</CODE> the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you are only dropping the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
specification.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables. (We plan to fix this in 4.0).

</P>
<P>
With identical tables we mean that all tables are created with identical
column and key information.  You can't put a MERGE over tables where the
columns are packed differently, doesn't have exactly the same columns or
have the keys in different order.  Some of the tables can however be
compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you will get a <CODE>.frm</CODE> table
definition file and a <CODE>.MRG</CODE> table list file.  The <CODE>.MRG</CODE> just
contains a list of the index files (<CODE>.MYI</CODE> files) that should
be used as one.  All used tables must be in the same database as the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table itself.

</P>
<P>
For the moment you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables can help you solve the following problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put data from
different months into separate files, compress some of them with
<CODE>myisampack</CODE>, and then create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> to use these as one.
<LI>

Give you more speed. You can split a big read-only table based on some
criteria and then put the different table part on different disks.
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on this could be much faster than using
the big table. (You can, of course, also use a RAID to get the same
kind of benefits.)
<LI>

Do more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you are looking
after, you can search in just one of the split tables for some queries
and use <STRONG>MERGE</STRONG> table for others.  You can even have many
different <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables active, with possible overlapping files.
<LI>

More efficient repairs. It's easier to repair the individual files that
are mapped to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> file than trying to repair a real big file.
<LI>

Instant mapping of many files as one. A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table uses the
index of the individual tables. It doesn't need to maintain an index of
its one.  This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table collections VERY fast to make or
remap.  Note that you must specify the key definitions when you create
a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table!.
<LI>

If you have a set of tables that you join to a big table on demand or
batch, you should instead create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on them on demand.
This is much faster and will save a lot of disk space.
<LI>

Go around the file size limit for the operating system.
<LI>

You can create an alias/synonym for a table by just using MERGE over one
table. There shouldn't be any really notable performance impacts of doing this
(only a couple of indirect calls and memcpy's for each read).
</UL>

<P>
The disadvantages with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can't use <CODE>INSERT</CODE> on <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables, as MySQL
can't know in which of the tables we should insert the row.
<LI>

You can only use identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables for a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables uses more file descriptors. If you are using a
<STRONG>MERGE</STRONG> that maps over 10 tables and 10 users are using this, you
are using 10*10 + 10 file descriptors.  (10 data files for 10 users
and 10 shared index files.)
<LI>

Key reads are slower. When you do a read on a key, the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
handler will need to issue a read on all underlying tables to check
which one most closely matches the given key.  If you then do a 'read-next'
then the merge table handler will need to search the read buffers
to find the next key. Only when one key buffer is used up, the handler
will need to read the next key block. This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> keys much slower
on <CODE>eq_ref</CODE> searches, but not much slower on <CODE>ref</CODE> searches.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

You can't do <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE FROM
table_name</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause on any of the table that is
mapped by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table that is 'open'.  If you do this, the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table may still refer to the original table and you will
get unexpected results.
</UL>

<P>
The following example shows you how to use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t1");
INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t2");
CREATE TABLE total (a INT NOT NULL, message CHAR(20), KEY(a)) TYPE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we didn't create a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in the
<CODE>total</CODE> table as the key isn't going to be unique in the <CODE>total</CODE>
table.

</P>
<P>
Note that you can also manipulate the <CODE>.MRG</CODE> file directly from
the outside of the MySQL server:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /mysql-data-directory/current-database
shell&#62; ls -1 t1.MYI t2.MYI &#62; total.MRG
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-tables
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can do things like:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select * from total;
+---+---------+
| a | message |
+---+---------+
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t1      |
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t2      |
+---+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
To remap a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table you can do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP</CODE> the table and re-create it
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name UNION(...)</CODE>
<LI>

Change the <CODE>.MRG</CODE> file and issue a <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> on the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and all underlying tables to force the handler to
read the new definition file.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="ISAM" HREF="manual_toc.html#ISAM">7.3  ISAM Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1423"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can also use the deprecated ISAM table type. This will disappear
rather soon because <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is a better implementation of the same
thing. ISAM uses a <CODE>B-tree</CODE> index. The index is stored in a file
with the <CODE>.ISM</CODE> extension, and the data is stored in a file with the
<CODE>.ISD</CODE> extension.  You can check/repair ISAM tables with the
<CODE>isamchk</CODE> utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> has the following features/properties:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Compressed and fixed-length keys

<LI>Fixed and dynamic record length

<LI>16 keys with 16 key parts/key

<LI>Max key length 256 (default)

<LI>Data is stored in machine format; this is fast, but is machine/OS dependent.

</UL>

<P>
Most of the things true for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are also true for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  MyISAM Tables</A>. The major differences compared to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>ISAM tables are not binary portable across OS/Platforms.

<LI>Can't handle tables &#62; 4G.

<LI>Only support prefix compression on strings.

<LI>Smaller key limits.

<LI>Dynamic tables get more fragmented.

<LI>Tables are compressed with <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> rather than with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
If you want to convert an <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table to a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table so
that you can use utilities such as <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>, use an <CODE>ALTER

<H2><A NAME="HEAP" HREF="manual_toc.html#HEAP">7.4  HEAP Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1424"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use a hashed index and are stored in memory.  This
makes them very fast, but if MySQL crashes you will lose all
data stored in them.  <CODE>HEAP</CODE> is very useful for temporary tables!

</P>
<P>
The MySQL internal HEAP tables use 100% dynamic hashing
without overflow areas. There is no extra space needed for free lists.
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables also don't have problems with delete + inserts, which
normally is common with hashed tables:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test TYPE=HEAP SELECT ip,SUM(downloads) as down
        FROM log_table GROUP BY ip;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(ip),AVG(down) FROM test;
mysql&#62; DROP TABLE test;
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some things you should consider when you use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You should always use specify <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> in the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement
to ensure that you accidentally do not use all memory.
<LI>

Indexes will only be used with <CODE>=</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> (but are VERY fast).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables can only use whole keys to search for a row; compare this
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables where any prefix of the key can be used to find rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use a fixed record length format.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support an index on a <CODE>NULL</CODE> column.
<LI>

You can have non-unique keys in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table (this isn't common for
hashed tables).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are shared between all clients (just like any other
table).
<LI>

You can't search for the next entry in order (that is, to use the index
to do an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>).
<LI>

Data for <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are allocated in small blocks. The tables
are 100% dynamic (on inserting). No overflow areas and no extra key
space are needed.  Deleted rows are put in a linked list and are
reused when you insert new data into the table.
<LI>

You need enough extra memory for all HEAP tables that you want to use at
the same time.
<LI>

To free memory, you should execute <CODE>DELETE FROM heap_table</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE heap_table</CODE> or <CODE>DROP TABLE heap_table</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL cannot find out approximately how many rows there
are between two values (this is used by the range optimizer to decide which
index to use).  This may affect some queries if you change a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table to a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table.
<LI>

To ensure that you accidentally don't do anything foolish, you can't create
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables bigger than <CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The memory needed for one row in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table is:

</P>

<PRE>
SUM_OVER_ALL_KEYS(max_length_of_key + sizeof(char*) * 2)
+ ALIGN(length_of_row+1, sizeof(char*))

BerkeleyDB, available at <a HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">http://www.sleepycat.com/</a> has provided 
MySQL with a transactional table handler.  By using BerkeleyDB
tables, your tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes, and also
provides <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> on transactions.  The 
MySQL source distribution comes with a BDB distribution that has a
couple of small patches to make it work more smoothly with MySQL.
You can't use a non-patched <CODE>BDB</CODE> version with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
We at MySQL AB are working in close cooperation with Sleepycat to
keep the quality of the MySQL/BDB interface high.

</P>
<P>
When it comes to supporting BDB tables, we are committed to help our
users to locate the problem and help creating a reproducable test case
for any problems involving BDB tables.  Any such test case will be
forwarded to Sleepycat who in turn will help us find and fix the
problem.  As this is a two stage operation, any problems with BDB tables
may take a little longer for us to fix than for other table handlers.
However, as the BerkeleyDB code itself has been used by many other
applications than MySQL, we don't envision any big problems with
this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_handler_support">1.3.5.6  Support for other table handlers</A>.

<H3><A NAME="BDB_characteristic" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_characteristic">7.5.4  Some characteristic of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables:</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

To be able to rollback transactions BDB maintain log files.  For maximum
performance you should place these on another disk than your databases
by using the <CODE>--bdb_log_dir</CODE> options.
<LI>

MySQL performs a checkpoint each time a new BDB log
file is started, and removes any log files that are not needed for
current transactions.  One can also run <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> at any time
to checkpoint the Berkeley DB tables.

For disaster recovery, one should use table backups plus
MySQL's binary log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: If you delete old log files that are in use, BDB will
not be able to do recovery at all and you may lose data if something
goes wrong.
<LI>

MySQL requires a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in each BDB table to be
able to refer to previously read rows. If you don't create one,
MySQL will create an maintain a hidden <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> for
you.  The hidden key has a length of 5 bytes and is incremented for each
insert attempt.
<LI>

If all columns you access in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table are part of the same index or
part of the primary key, then MySQL can execute the query
without having to access the actual row.  In a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table the
above holds only if the columns are part of the same index.
<LI>

The <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be faster than any other key, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is stored together with the row data.  As the other keys are
stored as the key data + the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, it's important to keep the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> as short as possible to save disk and get better speed.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works on <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables as with other tables.  If
you don't use <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE>, MYSQL will issue an internal
multiple-write lock on the table to ensure that the table will be
properly locked if another thread issues a table lock.
<LI>

Internal locking in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables is done on page level.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name</CODE> is slow as <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables doesn't
maintain a count of the number of rows in the table.
<LI>

Scanning is slower than with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as one has data in BDB
tables stored in B-trees and not in a separate data file.
<LI>

The application must always be prepared to handle cases where
any change of a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table may make an automatic rollback and any
read may fail with a deadlock error.
<LI>

Keys are not compressed to previous keys as with ISAM or MyISAM
tables. In other words, the key information will take a little more
space in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables compared to MyISAM tables which don't use
<CODE>PACK_KEYS=0</CODE>.
<LI>

There is often holes in the BDB table to allow you to insert new rows in
the middle of the key tree.  This makes BDB tables somewhat larger than
MyISAM tables.
<LI>

The optimizer needs to know an approximation of the number of rows in
the table.  MySQL solves this by counting inserts and
maintaining this in a separate segment in each BDB table.  If you don't
do a lot of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>:s this number should be
accurate enough for the MySQL optimizer, but as MySQL
only store the number on close, it may be wrong if MySQL dies
unexpectedly. It should not be fatal even if this number is not 100 %
correct.  One can update the number of rows by executing <CODE>ANALYZE
TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> . See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

If you get full disk with a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, you will get an error
(probably error 28) and the transaction should roll back.  This is in
contrast with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
wait for enough free disk before continuing.

<H3><A NAME="BDB_TODO" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_TODO">7.5.5  Some things we need to fix for BDB in the near future:</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

It's very slow to open many BDB tables at the same time. If you are
going to use BDB tables, you should not have a very big table cache (&#62;
256 ?) and you should use <CODE>--no-auto-rehash</CODE> with the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
client.  We plan to partly fix this in 4.0.
<LI>

tables.

InnoDB provides MySQL with a transaction-safe table handler with
commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities. InnoDB does
locking on row level, and also provides an Oracle-style consistent
non-locking read in <CODE>SELECTS</CODE>, which increases transaction
concurrency. There is not need for lock escalation in InnoDB,
because row level locks in InnoDB fit in very small space.

Technically, InnoDB is a database backend placed under MySQL. InnoDB
has its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main
memory. InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which
may consist of several files. This is different from, for example,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables where each table is stored as a separate file.

To use InnoDB tables you <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> specify configuration parameters

Suppose you have a Windows NT machine with 128 MB RAM and a single 10 GB

</PRE>

<P>
Note that data files must be &#60; 4G, and &#60; 2G on
some file systems! The total size of data files has
to be &#62;= 10 MB.
InnoDB does not create directories:
you have to create them yourself.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have a Linux machine with 512 MB RAM and
three 20 GB hard disks (at directory paths <TT>`/'</TT>,
<TT>`/dr2'</TT> and <TT>`/dr3'</TT>).
Below is an example of possible configuration parameters in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> for
InnoDB:

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata/ibdata1:2000M;dr2/ibdata/ibdata2:2000M

</PRE>

<P>
Note that we have placed the two data files on different disks.
The reason for the name <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> is that
you can also specify paths to your data files, and
<CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> is just textually catenated
before your data file paths, adding a possible slash or
backslash in between. InnoDB will fill the tablespace
formed by the data files from bottom up. In some cases it will
improve the performance of the database if all data is not placed
on the same physical disk. Putting log files on a different disk from
data is very often beneficial for performance.

</P>
<P>
The meanings of the configuration parameters are the following:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The common part of the directory path for all InnoDB data files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> </TD><TD>
Paths to individual data files and their sizes. The full directory path
to each data file is acquired by concatenating innodb_data_home_dir to
the paths specified here. The file sizes are specified in megabytes,
hence the 'M' after the size specification above. Do not set a file size
bigger than 4000M, and on most operating systems not bigger than 2000M.
InnoDB also understands the abbreviation 'G', 1G meaning 1024M.
The sum of the sizes of the files must be at least 10 MB.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_mirrored_log_groups</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of identical copies of log groups we
keep for the database. Currently this should be set to 1.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
Directory path to InnoDB log files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_files_in_group</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of log files in the log group. InnoDB writes to the files in a
circular fashion. Value 3 is recommended here.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_file_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of each log file in a log group in megabytes. Sensible values range
from 1M to the size of the buffer pool specified below. The bigger the
value, the less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer pool,
saving disk i/o. But bigger log files also mean that recovery will be
slower in case of a crash. File size restriction as for a data file.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_buffer_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the buffer which InnoDB uses to write log to the log files
on disk.  Sensible values range from 1M to half the combined size of log
files. A big log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need
to write the log to disk until the transaction commit. Thus, if you have
big transactions, making the log buffer big will save disk i/o.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE> </TD><TD>
Normally this is set to 1, meaning that at a transaction commit the log
is flushed to disk, and the modifications made by the transaction become
permanent, and survive a database crash. If you are willing to
compromise this safety, and you are running small transactions, you may
set this to 0 to reduce disk i/o to the logs.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_arch_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The directory where fully written log files would be archived if we used
log archiving.  The value of this parameter should currently be set the
same as <CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_archive</CODE> </TD><TD>
This value should currently be set to 0.  As recovery from a backup is
done by MySQL using its own log files, there is currently no need to
archive InnoDB log files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_buffer_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of
its tables.  The bigger you set this the less disk i/o is needed to
access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
parameter up to 90 % of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may cause
paging in the operating system.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_additional_mem_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of a memory pool InnoDB uses to store data dictionary information
and other internal data structures. A sensible value for this might be
2M, but the more tables you have in your application the more you will
need to allocate here. If InnoDB runs out of memory in this pool, it
will start to allocate memory from the operating system, and write
warning messages to the MySQL error log.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_file_io_threads</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of file i/o threads in InnoDB. Normally, this should be 4, but
on Windows NT disk i/o may benefit from a larger number.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> </TD><TD>
Timeout in seconds an InnoDB transaction may wait for a lock before
being rolled back.  InnoDB automatically detects transaction deadlocks
in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> command, or other transaction-safe table handlers
than InnoDB in the same transaction, then a deadlock may arise which
InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like this the timeout is useful to
resolve the situation.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> </TD><TD>
(Available from 3.23.40 up.)
The default value for this is <CODE>fdatasync</CODE>.
Another option is <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE>.

A new InnoDB database has now been created. You can connect to the MySQL

When you shut down the MySQL server with <TT>`mysqladmin shutdown'</TT>,
InnoDB output will be like the following:

<P>
If something goes wrong in an InnoDB database creation, you should
delete all files created by InnoDB. This means all data files, all log
files, the small archived log file, and in the case you already did
create some InnoDB tables, delete also the corresponding <TT>`.frm'</TT>
files for these tables from the MySQL database
directories. Then you can try the InnoDB database creation again.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Using_InnoDB_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_InnoDB_tables">7.6.4  Creating InnoDB tables</A></H3>

<P>
Suppose you have started the MySQL client with the command
<CODE>mysql test</CODE>.
To create a table in the InnoDB format you must specify
<CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE> in the table creation SQL command:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (A INT, B CHAR (20), INDEX (A)) TYPE = InnoDB;
</PRE>

<P>
This SQL command will create a table and an index on column <CODE>A</CODE>
into the InnoDB tablespace consisting of the data files you specified
in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>. In addition MySQL will create a file
<TT>`CUSTOMER.frm'</TT> to the MySQL database directory <TT>`test'</TT>.
Internally, InnoDB will add to its own data dictionary an entry
for table <CODE>'test/CUSTOMER'</CODE>. Thus you can create a table
of the same name <CODE>CUSTOMER</CODE> in another database of MySQL, and
the table names will not collide inside InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
You can query the amount of free space in the InnoDB tablespace
by issuing the table status command of MySQL for any table you have
created with <CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE>. Then the amount of free
space in the tablespace appears in the table comment section in the
output of <CODE>SHOW</CODE>. An example:

</P>

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM test LIKE 'CUSTOMER'
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the statistics <CODE>SHOW</CODE> gives about InnoDB tables
are only approximate: they are used in SQL optimization. Table and
index reserved sizes in bytes are accurate, though.

</P>
<P>
NOTE: <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> does not currently work for InnoDB tables!
You must drop the tables individually. Also take care not to delete or
add <TT>`.frm'</TT> files to your InnoDB database manually: use
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> commands.
InnoDB has its own internal data dictionary, and you will get problems
if the MySQL <TT>`.frm'</TT> files are out of 'sync' with the InnoDB
internal data dictionary.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC419" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC419">7.6.4.1  Converting MyISAM tables to InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB does not have a special optimization for separate index creation.
Therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create indexes
afterwards.
The fastest way to alter a table to InnoDB is to do the inserts
directly to an InnoDB table, that is, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... TYPE=INNODB</CODE>,
or create an empty InnoDB table with identical definitions and insert
the rows with <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To get better control over the insertion process, it may be good to insert
big tables in pieces:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable WHERE yourkey &#62; something
                                             AND yourkey &#60;= somethingelse;
</PRE>

<P>
After all data has been inserted you can rename the tables.

</P>
<P>
During the conversion of big tables you should set the InnoDB
buffer pool size big 
to reduce disk i/o. Not bigger than 80 % of the physical memory, though.
You should set InnoDB log files big, and also the log buffer large.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you do not run out of tablespace: InnoDB tables take a lot
more space than MyISAM tables. If an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> runs out
of space, it will start a rollback, and that can take hours if it is
disk-bound.
In inserts InnoDB uses the insert buffer to merge secondary index records
to indexes in batches. That saves a lot of disk i/o. In rollback no such
mechanism is used, and the rollback can take 30 times longer than the
insertion.

</P>
<P>
In the case of a runaway rollback, if you do not have valuable data in your
database,
it is better that you kill the database process and delete all InnoDB data
and log files and all InnoDB table <TT>`.frm'</TT> files, and start
your job again, rather than wait for millions of disk i/os to complete.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Adding_and_removing" HREF="manual_toc.html#Adding_and_removing">7.6.5  Adding and removing InnoDB data and log files</A></H3>

<P>
You cannot increase the size of an InnoDB data file. To add more into
your tablespace you have to add a new data file. To do this you have to
shut down your MySQL database, edit the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file, adding a
new file to <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, and then start MySQL
again.

</P>
<P>
Currently you cannot remove a data file from InnoDB. To decrease the
size of your database you have to use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> to dump
all your tables, create a new database, and import your tables to the
new database.

</P>
<P>
If you want to change the number or the size of your InnoDB log files,
you have to shut down MySQL and make sure that it shuts down without errors.
Then copy the old log files into a safe place just in case something
went wrong in the shutdown and you will need them to recover the
database. Delete then the old log files from the log file directory,
edit <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>, and start MySQL again. InnoDB will tell
you at the startup that it is creating new log files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Backing_up" HREF="manual_toc.html#Backing_up">7.6.6  Backing up and recovering an InnoDB database</A></H3>

<P>
The key to safe database management is taking regular backups.
To take a 'binary' backup of your database you have to do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Shut down your MySQL database and make sure it shuts down without errors.
<LI>

Copy all your data files into a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all your InnoDB log files to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> configuration file(s) to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files for your InnoDB tables into a
safe place.
</UL>

<P>
There is currently no on-line or incremental backup tool available for
InnoDB, though they are in the TODO list.

</P>
<P>
In addition to taking the binary backups described above,
you should also regularly take dumps of your tables with
<TT>`mysqldump'</TT>. The reason to this is that a binary file
may be corrupted without you noticing it. Dumped tables are stored
into text files which are human-readable and much simpler than
database binary files. Seeing table corruption from dumped files
is easier, and since their format is simpler, the chance for
serious data corruption in them is smaller.

</P>
<P>
A good idea is to take the dumps at the same time you take a binary
backup of your database. You have to shut out all clients from your
database to get a consistent snapshot of all your tables into your
dumps. Then you can take the binary backup, and you will then have
a consistent snapshot of your database in two formats. 

</P>
<P>
To be able to recover your InnoDB database to the present from the
binary backup described above, you have to run your MySQL database
with the general logging and log archiving of MySQL switched on. Here
by the general logging we mean the logging mechanism of the MySQL server
which is independent of InnoDB logs.

</P>
<P>
To recover from a crash of your MySQL server process, the only thing
you have to do is to restart it. InnoDB will automatically check the
logs and perform a roll-forward of the database to the present.
InnoDB will automatically roll back uncommitted transactions which were
present at the time of the crash. During recovery, InnoDB will print
out something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.

</PRE>

<P>
If your database gets corrupted or your disk fails, you have
to do the recovery from a backup. In the case of corruption, you should
first find a backup which is not corrupted. From a backup do the recovery
from the general log files of MySQL according to instructions in the
MySQL manual.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_checkpoints" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_checkpoints">7.6.6.1  Checkpoints</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB implements a checkpoint mechanism called a fuzzy
checkpoint. InnoDB will flush modified database pages from the buffer
pool in small batches, there is no need to flush the buffer pool
in one single batch, which would in practice stop processing
of user SQL statements for a while.

</P>
<P>
In crash recovery InnoDB looks for a checkpoint label written
to the log files. It knows that all modifications to the database
before the label are already present on the disk image of the database.
Then InnoDB scans the log files forward from the place of the checkpoint
applying the logged modifications to the database.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB writes to the log files in a circular fashion.
All committed modifications which make the database pages in the buffer
pool different from the images on disk must be available in the log files
in case InnoDB has to do a recovery. This means that when InnoDB starts
to reuse a log file in the circular fashion, it has to make sure that the
database page images on disk already contain the modifications
logged in the log file InnoDB is going to reuse. In other words, InnoDB
has to make a checkpoint and often this involves flushing of
modified database pages to disk.

</P>
<P>
The above explains why making your log files very big may save
disk i/o in checkpointing. It can make sense to set
the total size of the log files as big as the buffer pool or even bigger.
The drawback in big log files is that crash recovery can last longer
because there will be more log to apply to the database.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Moving" HREF="manual_toc.html#Moving">7.6.7  Moving an InnoDB database to another machine</A></H3>

<P>
InnoDB data and log files are binary-compatible on all platforms
if the floating point number format on the machines is the same.
You can move an InnoDB database simply by copying all the relevant
files, which we already listed in the previous section on backing up
a database. If the floating point formats on the machines are
different but you have not used <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
data types in your tables then the procedure is the same: just copy
the relevant files. If the formats are different and your tables
contain floating point data, you have to use <TT>`mysqldump'</TT>
and <TT>`mysqlimport'</TT> to move those tables.

</P>
<P>
A performance tip is to switch off the auto commit when you import
data into your database, assuming your tablespace has enough space for
the big rollback segment the big import transaction will generate.
Do the commit only after importing a whole table or a segment of
a table.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_transaction_model" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_transaction_model">7.6.8  InnoDB transaction model</A></H3>

<P>
In the InnoDB transaction model the goal has been to combine the best
sides of a multiversioning database to traditional two-phase locking.
InnoDB does locking on row level and runs queries by default
as non-locking consistent reads, in the style of Oracle.
The lock table in InnoDB is stored so space-efficiently that lock
escalation is not needed: typically several users are allowed
to lock every row in the database, or any random subset of the rows,
without InnoDB running out of memory.

</P>
<P>
In InnoDB all user activity happens inside transactions. If the
auto commit mode is used in MySQL, then each SQL statement
will form a single transaction. If the auto commit mode is
switched off, then we can think that a user always has a transaction
open. If he issues
the SQL <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement, that
ends the current transaction, and a new starts. Both statements
will release all InnoDB locks that were set during the
current transaction. A <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> means that the
changes made in the current transaction are made permanent
and become visible to other users. A <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>
on the other hand cancels all modifications made by the current
transaction.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_consistent_read" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_consistent_read">7.6.8.1  Consistent read</A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read means that InnoDB uses its multiversioning to
present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time.
The query will see the changes made by exactly those transactions that
committed before that point of time, and no changes made by later
or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule is that the
query will see the changes made by the transaction itself which issues
the query.

</P>
<P>
When a transaction issues its first consistent read, InnoDB assigns
the snapshot, or the point of time, which all consistent reads in the
same transaction will use. In the snapshot are all transactions that
committed before assigning the snapshot. Thus the consistent reads
within the same transaction will also be consistent with respect to each
other. You can get a fresher snapshot for your queries by committing
the current transaction and after that issuing new queries.

</P>
<P>
Consistent read is the default mode in which InnoDB processes
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements. A consistent read does not set any locks
on the tables it accesses, and therefore other users are free to
modify those tables at the same time a consistent read is being performed
on the table.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_locking_reads" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_locking_reads">7.6.8.2  Locking reads</A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read is not convenient in some circumstances.
Suppose you want to add a new row into your table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and make sure that the child already has a parent in table
<CODE>PARENT</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you use a consistent read to read the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>
and indeed see the parent of the child in the table. Can you now safely
add the child row to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>? No, because it may
happen that meanwhile some other user has deleted the parent row
from the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>, and you are not aware of that.

</P>
<P>
The solution is to perform the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> in a locking
mode, <CODE>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM PARENT WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
</PRE>

<P>
Performing a read in share mode means that we read the latest
available data, and set a shared mode lock on the rows we read.
If the latest data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another
user, we will wait until that transaction commits.
A shared mode lock prevents others from updating or deleting
the row we have read. After we see that the above query returns
the parent <CODE>'Jones'</CODE>, we can safely add his child
to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>, and commit our transaction.
This example shows how to implement referential
integrity in your application code.

</P>
<P>
Let us look at another example: we have an integer counter field in
a table <CODE>CHILD_CODES</CODE> which we use to assign
a unique identifier to each child we add to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>.
Obviously, using a consistent read or a shared mode read
to read the present value of the counter is not a good idea, since
then two users of the database may see the same value for the
counter, and we will get a duplicate key error when we add
the two children with the same identifier to the table.

</P>
<P>
In this case there are two good ways to implement the
reading and incrementing of the counter: (1) update the counter
first by incrementing it by 1 and only after that read it,
or (2) read the counter first with
a lock mode <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE>, and increment after that:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT COUNTER_FIELD FROM CHILD_CODES FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE CHILD_CODES SET COUNTER_FIELD = COUNTER_FIELD + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> will read the latest
available data setting exclusive locks on each row it reads.
Thus it sets the same locks a searched SQL <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> would set
on the rows.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Next-key_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Next-key_locking">7.6.8.3  Next-key locking: avoiding the phantom problem</A></H4>

<P>
In row level locking InnoDB uses an algorithm called next-key locking.
InnoDB does the row level locking so that when it searches or
scans an index of a table, it sets shared or exclusive locks
on the index records in encounters. Thus the row level locks are
more precisely called index record locks.

</P>
<P>
The locks InnoDB sets on index records also affect the 'gap'
before that index record. If a user has a shared or exclusive
lock on record R in an index, then another user cannot insert
a new index record immediately before R in the index order.
This locking of gaps is done to prevent the so-called phantom
problem. Suppose I want to read and lock all children with identifier
bigger than 100 from table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and update some field in the selected rows.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose there is an index on table <CODE>CHILD</CODE> on column
<CODE>ID</CODE>. Our query will scan that index starting from
the first record where <CODE>ID</CODE> is bigger than 100.
Now, if the locks set on the index records would not lock out
inserts made in the gaps, a new child might meanwhile be
inserted to the table. If now I in my transaction execute

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
again, I will see a new child in the result set the query returns.
This is against the isolation principle of transactions:
a transaction should be able to run so that the data
it has read does not change during the transaction. If we regard
a set of rows as a data item, then the new 'phantom' child would break
this isolation principle.

</P>
<P>
When InnoDB scans an index it can also lock the gap
after the last record in the index. Just that happens in the previous
example: the locks set by InnoDB will prevent any insert to
the table where <CODE>ID</CODE> would be bigger than 100.

</P>
<P>
You can use the next-key locking to implement a uniqueness
check in your application: if you read your data in share mode
and do not see a duplicate for a row you are going to insert,
then you can safely insert your row and know that the next-key
lock set on the successor of your row during the read will prevent
anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate for your row. Thus the next-key
locking allows you to 'lock' the non-existence of something in your
table.

</P>

about the following: since MySQL does know about row level locks,
it is possible that you
get a table lock on a table where another user currently has row level
locks. But that does not put transaction integerity into danger.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Deadlock_detection" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Deadlock_detection">7.6.8.5  Deadlock detection and rollback</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB automatically detects a deadlock of transactions and rolls
back the transaction whose lock request was the last one to build
a deadlock, that is, a cycle in the waits-for graph of transactions.
InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where a lock set by a MySQL
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> statement is involved, or if a lock set
in another table handler than InnoDB is involved. You have to resolve
these situations using <CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> set in

</P>
<P>
When InnoDB performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all the
locks of the transaction are released. However, if just a single SQL
statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks
set by the SQL statement may be preserved. This is because InnoDB
stores row locks in a format where it cannot afterwards know which was
set by which SQL statement.

not see the row deleted. Similarly with inserts and updates.

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction
and then doing another <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

If the Unix <TT>`top'</TT> or the Windows <TT>`Task Manager'</TT> shows that

Wrap several modifications into one transaction. InnoDB must
flush the log to disk at each transaction commit, if that transaction

<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
Make your log files big, even as big as the buffer pool. When InnoDB
has written the log files full, it has to write the modified contents
of the buffer pool to disk in a checkpoint. Small log files will cause many
unnecessary disk writes. The drawback in big log files is that recovery
time will be longer.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>5.</STRONG>
Also the log buffer should be quite big, say 8 MB.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>6.</STRONG> (Relevant from 3.23.39 up.)
In some versions of Linux and Unix, flushing files to disk with the Unix
<CODE>fdatasync</CODE> and other similar methods is surprisingly slow.
The default method InnoDB uses is the <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> function.
If you are not satisfied with the database write performance, you may
try setting <CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
to <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE>, though O_DSYNC seems to be slower on most systems.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>7.</STRONG> In importing data to InnoDB, make sure that MySQL does not have
<CODE>autocommit=1</CODE> on. Then every insert requires a log flush to disk.
Put before your plain SQL import file line

</P>

<PRE>
set autocommit=0;
</PRE>

<P>
and after it

</P>

<PRE>
commit;
</PRE>

<P>
If you use the <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> option <CODE>--opt</CODE>, you will get dump
files which are fast to import also to an InnoDB table, even without wrapping
them to the above <CODE>set autocommit=0; ... commit;</CODE> wrappers.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
Beware of big rollbacks of mass inserts: InnoDB uses the insert buffer
to save disk i/o in inserts, but in a corresponding rollback no such
mechanism is used. A disk-bound rollback can take 30 times the time
of the corresponding insert. Killing the database process will not
help because the rollback will start again at the database startup. The
only way to get rid of a runaway rollback is to increase the buffer pool
so that the rollback becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or delete the whole
InnoDB database.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
Beware also of other big disk-bound operations.
Use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> (from MySQL-4.0 up) to empty a table, not
<CODE>DELETE FROM yourtable</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>10.</STRONG>
Use the multi-line <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to reduce
communication overhead between the client and the server if you need
to insert many rows:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES (1, 2), (5, 5);
</PRE>

<P>
This tip is of course valid for inserts into any table type, not just InnoDB.

<P>
Starting from version 3.23.41 InnoDB includes the InnoDB
Monitor which prints information on the InnoDB internal state.
When swithed on, InnoDB Monitor
will make the MySQL server to print data to the standard

purge and insert buffer merge activity of the main thread
of InnoDB.
</UL>

<P>
You can start InnoDB Monitor through the following
SQL command:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE innodb_monitor(a int) type = innodb;
</PRE>

<P>
and stop it by

</P>

<PRE>
DROP TABLE innodb_monitor;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> syntax is just a way to pass a command
to the InnoDB engine through the MySQL SQL parser: the created
table is not relevant at all for InnoDB Monitor. If you shut down
the database when the monitor is running, and you want to start
the monitor again, you have to drop the
table before you can issue a new <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
to start the monitor.
This syntax may change in a future release.

threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or
a rw-lock semaphore. A big number of threads waiting
for semaphores may be a result of disk i/o, or
contention problems inside InnoDB. Contention can be
due to heavy parallelism of queries, or problems in
operating system thread scheduling.

Section CURRENT PENDING FILE I/O'S lists pending

<H3><A NAME="Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Implementation">7.6.10  Implementation of multiversioning</A></H3>

<P>
Since InnoDB is a multiversioned database, it must keep information
of old versions of rows in the tablespace. This information is stored
in a data structure we call a rollback segment after an analogous
data structure in Oracle.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB internally adds two fields to each row stored in the database.
A 6-byte field tells the transaction identifier for the last
transaction which inserted or updated the row. Also a deletion
is internally treated as an update where a special bit in the row
is set to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte
field called the roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an
undo log record written to the rollback segment. If the row was
updated, then the undo log record contains the information necessary
to rebuild the content of the row before it was updated.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the
undo operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the
information to build earlier versions of a row for a consistent
read.

</P>
<P>
Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update
undo logs. Insert undo logs are only needed in transaction rollback
and can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs
are used also in consistent reads, and they can be discarded only after
there is no transaction present for which InnoDB has assigned
a snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information
in the update undo log to build an earlier version of a database
row.

</P>
<P>
You must remember to commit your transactions regularly. Otherwise
InnoDB cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the
rollback segment may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

</P>
<P>
The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment
is typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated
row. You can use this information to calculate the space need
for your rollback segment.

</P>
<P>
In our multiversioning scheme a row is not physically removed from
the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.
Only  when InnoDB can discard the update undo log record written for
the deletion, it can also physically remove the corresponding row and
its index records from the database. This removal operation is
called a purge, and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of
time as the SQL statement which did the deletion.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_and_index" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_and_index">7.6.11  Table and index structures</A></H3>

<P>
Every InnoDB table has a special index called the clustered index
where the data of the rows is stored. If you define a
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> on your table, then the index of the primary key
will be the clustered index.

</P>
<P>
If you do not define a primary key for
your table, InnoDB will internally generate a clustered index
where the rows are ordered by the row id InnoDB assigns
to the rows in such a table. The row id is a 6-byte field which
monotonically increases as new rows are inserted. Thus the rows
ordered by the row id will be physically in the insertion order.

</P>
<P>
Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast, because
the row data will be on the same page where the index search
leads us. In many databases the data is traditionally stored on a different
page from the index record. If a table is large, the clustered
index architecture often saves a disk i/o when compared to the
traditional solution.

</P>
<P>
The records in non-clustered indexes (we also call them secondary indexes),
in InnoDB contain the primary key value for the row. InnoDB
uses this primary key value to search for the row from the clustered
index. Note that if the primary key is long, the secondary indexes
will use more space.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_physical_structure" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_physical_structure">7.6.11.1  Physical structure of an index</A></H4>

<P>
All indexes in InnoDB are B-trees where the index records are
stored in the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index
page is 16 kB. When new records are inserted, InnoDB tries to
leave 1 / 16 of the page free for future insertions and updates
of the index records.

</P>
<P>
If index records are inserted in a sequential (ascending or descending)
order, the resulting index pages will be about 15/16 full.
If records are inserted in a random order, then the pages will be
1/2 - 15/16 full. If the fillfactor of an index page drops below 1/2,
InnoDB will try to contract the index tree to free the page.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Insert_buffering" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Insert_buffering">7.6.11.2  Insert buffering</A></H4>

<P>
It is a common situation in a database application that the
primary key is a unique identifier and new rows are inserted in the
ascending order of the primary key. Thus the insertions to the
clustered index do not require random reads from a disk.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, secondary indexes are usually non-unique and
insertions happen in a relatively random order into secondary indexes.
This would cause a lot of random disk i/o's without a special mechanism
used in InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
If an index record should be inserted to a non-unique secondary index,
InnoDB checks if the secondary index page is already in the buffer
pool. If that is the case, InnoDB will do the insertion directly to
the index page. But, if the index page is not found from the buffer
pool, InnoDB inserts the record to a special insert buffer structure.
The insert buffer is kept so small that it entirely fits in the buffer
pool, and insertions can be made to it very fast.

</P>
<P>
The insert buffer is periodically merged to the secondary index
trees in the database. Often we can merge several insertions on the
same page in of the index tree, and hence save disk i/o's.
It has been measured that the insert buffer can speed up insertions
to a table up to 15 times.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Adaptive_hash" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Adaptive_hash">7.6.11.3  Adaptive hash indexes</A></H4>

<P>
If a database fits almost entirely in main memory, then the fastest way
to perform queries on it is to use hash indexes. InnoDB has an
automatic mechanism which monitors index searches made to the indexes
defined for a table, and if InnoDB notices that queries could
benefit from building of a hash index, such an index is automatically
built.

</P>
<P>
But note that the hash index is always built based on an existing
B-tree index on the table. InnoDB can build a hash index on a prefix
of any length of the key defined for the B-tree, depending on
what search pattern InnoDB observes on the B-tree index.
A hash index can be partial: it is not required that the whole
B-tree index is cached in the buffer pool. InnoDB will build
hash indexes on demand to those pages of the index which are
often accessed.

</P>
<P>
In a sense, through the adaptive hash index mechanism InnoDB adapts itself
to ample main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main memory
databases.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Physical_record" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Physical_record">7.6.11.4  Physical record structure</A></H4>


<UL>
<LI>

Each index record in InnoDB contains a header of 6 bytes. The header
is used to link consecutive records together, and also in the row level
locking.
<LI>

Records in the clustered index contain fields for all user-defined
columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte field for the transaction id
and a 7-byte field for the roll pointer.
<LI>

If the user has not defined a primary key for a table, then each clustered
index record contains also a 6-byte row id field.

Each secondary index record contains also all the fields defined
for the clustered index key.

A record contains also a pointer to each field of the record.

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="SEC439" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC439">7.6.11.5  How an auto-increment column works in InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
After a database startup, when a user first does an insert to a
table <CODE>T</CODE>
where an auto-increment column has been defined, and the user does not provide
an explicit value for the column, then InnoDB executes <CODE>SELECT
MAX(auto-inc-column) FROM T</CODE>, and assigns that value incremented
by one to the the column and the auto-increment counter of the table.
We say that
the auto-increment counter for table <CODE>T</CODE> has been initialized.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB follows the same procedure in initializing the auto-increment counter
for a freshly created table.

</P>
<P>
Note that if the user specifies in an insert the value 0 to the auto-increment
column, then InnoDB treats the row like the value would not have been
specified.

</P>
<P>
After the auto-increment counter has been initialized, if a user inserts
a row where he explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is bigger
than the current counter value, then the counter is set to the specified
column value. If the user does not explicitly specify a value, then InnoDB
increments the counter by one and assigns its new value to the column.

</P>
<P>
The auto-increment mechanism, when assigning values from the counter,
bypasses locking and transaction handling. Therefore you may also get
gaps in the number sequence if you roll back transactions which have
got numbers from the counter.

</P>
<P>
The behavior of auto-increment is not defined if a user gives a negative
value to the column or if the value becomes bigger than the maximum
integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="File_space_management" HREF="manual_toc.html#File_space_management">7.6.12  File space management and disk i/o</A></H3>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Disk_i_o" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Disk_i_o">7.6.12.1  Disk i/o</A></H4>

<P>
In disk i/o InnoDB uses asynchronous i/o. On Windows NT
it uses the native asynchronous i/o provided by the operating system.
On Unix, InnoDB uses simulated asynchronous i/o built
into InnoDB: InnoDB creates a number of i/o threads to take care
of i/o operations, such as read-ahead. In a future version we will
add support for simulated aio on Windows NT and native aio on those
versions of Unix which have one.

</P>
<P>
On Windows NT InnoDB uses non-buffered i/o. That means that the disk
pages InnoDB reads or writes are not buffered in the operating system
file cache. This saves some memory bandwidth.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41 InnoDB uses a novel file flush technique
called doublewrite.
It adds safety to crash recovery after an operating system crash
or a power outage, and improves performance on most Unix flavors
by reducing the need for fsync operations.

</P>
<P>
Doublewrite means that InnoDB before writing pages to a data file
first writes them to a contiguous tablespace area called the
doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite
buffer has completed, InnoDB writes the pages to their proper
positions in the data file. If the operating system crashes in the
middle of a page write, InnoDB will in recovery find a good
copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41
you can also use a raw disk partition as a data file, though this has
not been tested yet. When you create a new data file you have
to put the keyword <CODE>newraw</CODE> immediately after the data
file size in <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>. The partition must be
&#62;= than you specify as the size. Note that 1M in InnoDB is
1024 x 1024 bytes, while in disk specifications 1 MB usually means
1000 000 bytes.

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:3Gnewraw;hdd2:2Gnewraw
</PRE>

<P>
When you start the database again you MUST change the keyword
to <CODE>raw</CODE>. Otherwise InnoDB will write over your
partition!

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:3Graw;hdd2:2Graw
</PRE>

<P>
Using a raw disk you can on some Unixes perform non-buffered i/o.

</P>
<P>
There are two read-ahead heuristics in InnoDB: sequential read-ahead
and random read-ahead. In sequential read-ahead InnoDB notices that
the access pattern to a segment in the tablespace is sequential.
Then InnoDB will post in advance a batch of reads of database pages to the
i/o system. In random read-ahead InnoDB notices that some area
in a tablespace seems to be in the process of being
fully read into the buffer pool. Then InnoDB posts the remaining
reads to the i/o system.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_space" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_space">7.6.12.2  File space management</A></H4>

<P>
The data files you define in the configuration file form the tablespace
of InnoDB. The files are simply catenated to form the tablespace,
there is no striping in use.
Currently you cannot directly instruct where the space is allocated
for your tables, except by using the following fact: from a newly created
tablespace InnoDB will allocate space starting from the low end.

</P>
<P>
The tablespace consists of database pages whose default size is 16 kB.
The pages are grouped into extents of 64 consecutive pages. The 'files' inside
a tablespace are called segments in InnoDB. The name of the rollback
segment is somewhat misleading because it actually contains many
segments in the tablespace.

</P>
<P>
For each index in InnoDB we allocate two segments: one is for non-leaf
nodes of the B-tree, the other is for the leaf nodes. The idea here is
to achieve better sequentiality for the leaf nodes, which contain the
data.

</P>
<P>
When a segment grows inside the tablespace, InnoDB allocates the
first 32 pages to it individually. After that InnoDB starts
to allocate whole extents to the segment.
InnoDB can add to a large segment up to 4 extents at a time to ensure
good sequentiality of data.

</P>
<P>
Some pages in the tablespace contain bitmaps of other pages, and
therefore a few extents in an InnoDB tablespace cannot be
allocated to segments as a whole, but only as individual pages.

</P>
<P>
When you issue a query <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM ... LIKE ...</CODE>
to ask for available free space in the tablespace, InnoDB will
report you the space which is certainly usable in totally free extents
of the tablespace. InnoDB always reserves some extents for
clean-up and other internal purposes; these reserved extents are not
included in the free space.

</P>
<P>
When you delete data from a table, InnoDB will contract the corresponding
B-tree indexes. It depends on the pattern of deletes if that frees
individual pages or extents to the tablespace, so that the freed
space is available for other users. Dropping a table or deleting
all rows from it is guaranteed to release the space to other users,
but remember that deleted rows can be physically removed only in a
purge operation after they are no longer needed in transaction rollback or
consistent read.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_Defragmenting" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_Defragmenting">7.6.12.3  Defragmenting a table</A></H4>

<P>
If there are random insertions or deletions
in the indexes of a table, the indexes
may become fragmented. By fragmentation we mean that the physical ordering
of the index pages on the disk is not close to the alphabetical ordering
of the records on the pages, or that there are many unused pages in the
64-page blocks which were allocated to the index.

</P>
<P>
It can speed up index scans if you
periodically use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> to dump the table to
a text file, drop the table, and reload it from the dump.
Another way to do the defragmenting is to <CODE>ALTER</CODE> the table type to
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and back to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> again.
Note that a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table must fit in a single file
on your operating system.

</P>
<P>
If the insertions to and index are always ascending and
records are deleted only from the end, then the the file space management
algorithm of InnoDB guarantees that fragmentation in the index will
not occur.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Error_handling" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_handling">7.6.13  Error handling</A></H3>

<P>
The error handling in InnoDB is not always the same as
specified in the ANSI SQL standards. According to the ANSI
standard, any error during an SQL statement should cause the
rollback of that statement. InnoDB sometimes rolls back only
part of the statement.
The following list specifies the error handling of InnoDB.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run out of file space in the tablespace,
you will get the MySQL <CODE>'Table is full'</CODE> error
and InnoDB rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

A transaction deadlock or a timeout in a lock wait will give
<CODE>'Table handler error 1000000'</CODE> and InnoDB rolls back
the SQL statement.
<LI>

A duplicate key error only rolls back the insert of that particular row,
even in a statement like <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
This will probably change so that the SQL statement will be rolled
back if you have not specified the <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> option in your
statement.
<LI>

A 'row too long' error rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

Other errors are mostly detected by the MySQL layer of code, and
they roll back the corresponding SQL statement.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_restrictions" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_restrictions">7.6.14  Some restrictions on InnoDB tables</A></H3>


<UL>

<LI><CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> does not give accurate statistics

on InnoDB tables, except for the physical size reserved by the table.
The row count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization.

<LI>

If you try to create an unique index on a prefix of a column you will get an
error:


<PRE>
CREATE TABLE T (A CHAR(20), B INT, UNIQUE (A(5))) TYPE = InnoDB;
</PRE>

If you create a non unique index on a prefix of a column, InnoDB will
create an index over the whole column.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is not supported for InnoDB tables.
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> operation does not know of InnoDB
row level locks set in already completed SQL statements: this means that
you can get a table lock on a table even if there still exist transactions
of other users which have row level locks on the same table. Thus
your operations on the table may have to wait if they collide with
these locks of other users. Also a deadlock is possible. However,
this does not endanger transaction integrity, because the row level
locks set by InnoDB will always take care of the integrity. 
Also, a table lock prevents other transactions from acquiring more
row level locks (in a conflicting lock mode) on the table.
<LI>

You cannot have a key on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column.
<LI>

A table cannot contain more than 1000 columns.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM TABLE</CODE> does not regenerate the table but instead
deletes all rows, one by one, which is not that fast. In future versions
of MySQL you can use <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> which is fast.
<LI>

Before dropping a database with InnoDB tables one has to drop
the individual InnoDB tables first.
<LI>

The default database page size in InnoDB is 16 kB. By recompiling the
code one can set it from 8 kB to 64 kB.
The maximun row length is slightly less than half of a database page
in versions &#60;= 3.23.40 of InnoDB. Starting from source
release 3.23.41 BLOB and
TEXT columns are allowed to be &#60; 4 GB, the total row length must also be
&#60; 4 GB. InnoDB does not store fields whose size is &#60;= 30 bytes on separate
pages. After InnoDB has modified the row by storing long fields on
separate pages, the remaining length of the row must be slightly less
than half a database page.
<LI>

The maximum data or log file size is 2 GB or 4 GB depending on how large
files your operating system supports. Support for &#62; 4 GB files will
be added to InnoDB in a future version.
<LI>

The maximum tablespace size is 4 billion database pages. This is also
the maximum size for a table. The minimum tablespace size is 10 MB.

This chapter describes the APIs available for MySQL, where to get
them, and how to use them.  The C API is the most extensively covered, as it
was developed by the MySQL team, and is the basis for most of the 
other APIs.

PHP is a server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language that may be used to
create dynamic Web pages.  It contains support for accessing several
databases, including MySQL.  PHP may be run as a separate program
or compiled as a module for use with the Apache Web server.

<LI>Error: "Maximum Execution Time Exceeded"

This is a PHP limit;  Go into the <TT>`php3.ini'</TT> file and set the maximum
execution time up from 30 seconds to something higher, as needed.
It is also not a bad idea to double the ram allowed per script to 16MB instead of
8 MB.
<LI>Error: "Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function mysql_connect() in .."

This means that your PHP version isn't compiled with MySQL support.
You can either compile a dynamic MySQL module and load it into PHP or
recompile PHP with built-in MySQL support.  This is described in
detail in the PHP manual.
<LI>Error: "undefined reference to `uncompress'"

This means that the client library is compiled with support for a compressed
client/server protocol. The fix is to add <CODE>-lz</CODE> last when linking
with <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE>.

<CODE>DBI</CODE> is a generic interface for many databases. That means that
you can write a script that works with many different database engines
without change. You need a DataBase Driver (DBD) defined for each
database type. For MySQL, this driver is called
<CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE>.

The Perl methods are described in more detail in the following sections.
Variables used for method return values have these meanings:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$dbh</CODE>
<DD>
Database handle

<DT><CODE>$sth</CODE>
<DD>
Statement handle

<DT><CODE>$rc</CODE>
<DD>
Return code (often a status)

<DT><CODE>$rv</CODE>
<DD>
Return value (often a row count)
</DL>

<P>
<STRONG>Portable DBI Methods</STRONG>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>connect($data_source, $username, $password)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1437"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1438"></A>
 
Use the <CODE>connect</CODE> method to make a database connection to the data
source. The <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value should begin with
<CODE>DBI:driver_name:</CODE>.
Example uses of <CODE>connect</CODE> with the <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> driver:

<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database", $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname",
                    $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname:$port",
                    $user, $password);
</PRE>

If the user name and/or password are undefined, <CODE>DBI</CODE> uses the
values of the <CODE>DBI_USER</CODE> and <CODE>DBI_PASS</CODE> environment variables,
respectively. If you don't specify a hostname, it defaults to
<CODE>'localhost'</CODE>. If you don't specify a port number, it defaults to the
default MySQL port (3306).

As of <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> Version 1.2009,
the <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value allows certain modifiers:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_file=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
Read <TT>`filename'</TT> as an option file.  For information on option files,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_group=group_name</CODE>
<DD>
The default group when reading an option file is normally the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> group.  By specifying the <CODE>mysql_read_default_group</CODE>
option, the default group becomes the <CODE>[group_name]</CODE> group.

<DT><CODE>mysql_compression=1</CODE>
<DD>
Use compressed communication between the client and server (MySQL
Version 3.22.3 or later).

<DT><CODE>mysql_socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the pathname of the Unix socket that is used to connect
to the server (MySQL Version 3.21.15 or later).
</DL>

Multiple modifiers may be given; each must be preceded by a semicolon.

For example, if you want to avoid hardcoding the user name and password into
a <CODE>DBI</CODE> script, you can take them from the user's <TT>`~/.my.cnf'</TT>
option file instead by writing your <CODE>connect</CODE> call like this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

This call will read options defined for the <CODE>[client]</CODE> group in the
option file.  If you wanted to do the same thing but use options specified
for the <CODE>[perl]</CODE> group as well, you could use this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf"
                . ";mysql_read_default_group=perl",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1439"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1440"></A>
<DT><CODE>disconnect</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>disconnect</CODE> method disconnects the database handle from the database.
This is typically called right before you exit from the program.
Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $dbh-&#62;disconnect;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1441"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1442"></A>
<DT><CODE>prepare($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
Prepares a SQL statement for execution by the database engine
and returns a statement handle <CODE>($sth)</CODE>, which you can use to invoke
the <CODE>execute</CODE> method.
Typically you handle <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements (and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like statements
such as <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>) by means of
<CODE>prepare</CODE> and <CODE>execute</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$sth = $dbh-&#62;prepare($statement)
    or die "Can't prepare $statement: $dbh-&#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1443"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1444"></A>
<DT><CODE>execute</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>execute</CODE> method executes a prepared statement. For
non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns the number of rows
affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>"0E0"</CODE>,
which Perl treats as zero but regards as true. If an error occurs,
<CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>undef</CODE>. For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements,
<CODE>execute</CODE> only starts the SQL query in the database; you need to use one
of the <CODE>fetch_*</CODE> methods described below to retrieve the data.
Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;execute
          or die "can't execute the query: $sth-&#62;errstr;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1445"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1446"></A>
<DT><CODE>do($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>do</CODE> method prepares and executes a SQL statement and returns the
number of rows affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>do</CODE> returns
<CODE>"0E0"</CODE>, which Perl treats as zero but regards as true.  This method is
generally used for non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements that cannot be prepared in
advance (due to driver limitations) or that do not need to be executed more
than once (inserts, deletes, etc.). Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $dbh-&#62;do($statement)
        or die "Can't execute $statement: $dbh- &#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

Generally the 'do' statement is MUCH faster (and is preferable)
than prepare/execute for statements that don't contain parameters.

<A NAME="IDX1447"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1448"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1450"></A>
<DT><CODE>quote($string)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>quote</CODE> method is used to "escape" any special characters contained in
the string and to add the required outer quotation marks.
Example:

<PRE>
$sql = $dbh-&#62;quote($string)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_array</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as an array of
field values.  Example:

<PRE>
while(@row = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_array) {
        print qw($row[0]\t$row[1]\t$row[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1454"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as a reference
to an array of field values. Example:

<PRE>
while($row_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_arrayref) {
        print qw($row_ref-&#62;[0]\t$row_ref-&#62;[1]\t$row_ref-&#62;[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1455"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1456"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_hashref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches a row of data and returns a reference to a hash
table containing field name/value pairs. This method is not nearly as
efficient as using array references as demonstrated above. Example:

<PRE>
while($hash_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_hashref) {
        print qw($hash_ref-&#62;{firstname}\t$hash_ref-&#62;{lastname}\t\
                $hash_ref- &#62; title}\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1458"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchall_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used to get all the data (rows) to be returned from the
SQL statement. It returns a reference to an array of references to arrays
for each row. You access or print the data by using a nested
loop. Example:

<PRE>
my $table = $sth-&#62;fetchall_arrayref
                or die "$sth-&#62;errstr\n";
my($i, $j);
for $i ( 0 .. $#{$table} ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$table-&#62;[$i]} ) {
                print "$table-&#62;[$i][$j]\t";
        }
        print "\n";
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1460"></A>
<DT><CODE>finish</CODE>
<DD>
Indicates that no more data will be fetched from this statement
handle. You call this method to free up the statement handle and any
system resources associated with it.  Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $sth-&#62;finish;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1461"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1462"></A>
<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number of rows changed (updated, deleted, etc.) by the last
command.  This is usually used after a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> <CODE>execute</CODE>
statement.  Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;rows;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1463"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1464"></A>
<DT><CODE>NULLABLE</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of
the array, a value of TRUE indicates that this
column may contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
Example:

<PRE>
$null_possible = $sth-&#62;{NULLABLE};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1465"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1466"></A>
<DT><CODE>NUM_OF_FIELDS</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute indicates
the number of fields returned by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>
statement.  You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a
result: A zero value indicates a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement like
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$nr_of_fields = $sth-&#62;{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1467"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1468"></A>
<DT><CODE>data_sources($driver_name)</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns an array containing names of databases available to the
MySQL server on the host <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
@dbs = DBI-&#62;data_sources("mysql");
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1469"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1470"></A>
<DT><CODE>ChopBlanks</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute determines whether the <CODE>fetchrow_*</CODE> methods will chop
leading and trailing blanks from the returned values.
Example:

<PRE>
$sth-&#62;{'ChopBlanks'} =1;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1471"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1472"></A>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level, $trace_filename)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>trace</CODE> method enables or disables tracing.  When invoked as a
<CODE>DBI</CODE> class method, it affects tracing for all handles.  When invoked as
a database or statement handle method, it affects tracing for the given
handle (and any future children of the handle).  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE>
to 2 provides detailed trace information.  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE> to 0
disables tracing.  Trace output goes to the standard error output by
default.  If <CODE>$trace_filename</CODE> is specified, the file is opened in
append mode and output for <EM>all</EM> traced handles is written to that
file.  Example:

<PRE>
DBI-&#62;trace(2);                # trace everything
DBI-&#62;trace(2,"/tmp/dbi.out"); # trace everything to
                              # /tmp/dbi.out
$dth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this database handle
$sth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this statement handle
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1473"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1474"></A>
You can also enable <CODE>DBI</CODE> tracing by setting the <CODE>DBI_TRACE</CODE>
environment variable.  Setting it to a numeric value is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(value)</CODE>.  Setting it to a pathname is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(2,value)</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>insertid</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1475"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1476"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1477"></A>
 
If you use the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> feature of MySQL, the new
auto-incremented values will be stored here.
Example:

<PRE>
$new_id = $sth-&#62;{insertid};
</PRE>

As an alternative, you can use <CODE>$dbh-&#62;{'mysql_insertid'}</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1478"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1479"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_blob</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_blob};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1480"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1481"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a key.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1482"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1483"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_num</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column contains numeric values.
Example:

<PRE>
$nums = $sth-&#62;{is_num};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1484"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1485"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_pri_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the respective column is a primary key.
Example:

<PRE>
$pri_keys = $sth-&#62;{is_pri_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1486"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1487"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_not_null</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of FALSE indicates that this column may contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.
Example:

<PRE>
$not_nulls = $sth-&#62;{is_not_null};
</PRE>

<CODE>is_not_null</CODE> is deprecated; it is preferable to use the
<CODE>NULLABLE</CODE> attribute (described above), because that is a DBI standard.

<A NAME="IDX1491"></A>
<DT><CODE>length</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>max_length</CODE>

MySQL provides support for ODBC by means of the <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>
program.  This chapter will teach you how to install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>,
and how to use it.  Here, you will also find a list of common programs that
are known to work with <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Installing_MyODBC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Installing_MyODBC">8.3.1  How To Install MyODBC</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> is a 32-bit ODBC (2.50) level 0 (with level 1 and level
2 features) driver for connecting an ODBC-aware application to
MySQL.  <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> works on Windows95, Windows98, NT, and
on most Unix platforms.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> is in public domain, and you can find the newest version
at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problem with <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> and your program also works
with OLEDB, you should try the OLEDB driver that you can find in the
Contrib section.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Contrib">D  Contributed Programs</A>.

</P>
<P>
Normally you only need to install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> on Windows machines.
You only need <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> for Unix if you have a program like
ColdFusion that is running on the Unix machine and uses ODBC to connect
to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you want to install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> on a Unix box, you will also need
an <STRONG>ODBC</STRONG> manager.  <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> is known to work with
most of the Unix ODBC managers.  You can find a list at these in the
<STRONG>ODBC</STRONG>-related links section on the MySQL useful links page.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Useful_Links">1.2.3  Useful MySQL-related Links</A>.

</P>
<P>
To install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> on Windows, you should download the
appropriate <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> .zip file (for Windows or NT/Win2000),
unpack it with <CODE>WINZIP</CODE>, or some similar program, and execute the
<CODE>SETUP.EXE</CODE> file.

</P>
<P>
On Windows/NT you may get the following error when trying to install
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>:

</P>

<PRE>
An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
use ODBC)
</PRE>

<P>
The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing <CODE>Ignore</CODE> to copy the rest
of the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If
this doesn't work, the solution is to reboot your computer in ``safe
mode`` (Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts
Windows during rebooting), install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>, and reboot to normal
mode.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To make a connection to a Unix box from a Windows box, with an ODBC
application (one that doesn't support MySQL natively), you must
first install <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> on the Windows machine.
<LI>

The user and Windows machine must have the access privileges to the
MySQL server on the Unix machine.  This is set up with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

You must create an ODBC DSN entry as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

Open the Control Panel on the Windows machine.
<LI>

Double-click the ODBC Data Sources 32 bits icon.
<LI>

Click the tab User DSN.
<LI>

Click the button Add.
<LI>

Select MySQL in the screen Create New Data Source and click
the Finish button.
<LI>

The MySQL Driver default configuration screen is shown.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">8.3.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

Now start your application and select the ODBC driver with the DSN you
specified in the ODBC administrator.
</UL>

<P>
Notice that there are other configuration options on the screen of
MySQL (trace, don't prompt on connect, etc) that you can try if
you run into problems.

There are three possibilities for specifying the server name on
Windows95:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use the IP address of the server.
<LI>

Add a file <TT>`\windows\lmhosts'</TT> with the following information:


<PRE>
ip hostname
</PRE>

For example:


<PRE>
194.216.84.21 my_hostname
</PRE>

<LI>

Configure the PC to use DNS.
</UL>

<P>
Example of how to fill in the <CODE>ODBC setup</CODE>:

<PRE>
Windows DSN name:   test
Description:        This is my test database
MySql Database:     test

User:               monty
Password:           my_password
Port:
</PRE>

<P>
The value for the <CODE>Windows DSN name</CODE> field is any name that is unique
in your Windows ODBC setup.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to specify values for the <CODE>Server</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>,
<CODE>Password</CODE>, or <CODE>Port</CODE> fields in the ODBC setup screen.
However, if you do, the values will be used as the defaults later when
you attempt to make a connection.  You have the option of changing the
values at that time.

</P>
<P>
If the port number is not given, the default port (3306)
is used.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the option <CODE>Read options from C:\my.cnf</CODE>, the groups
<CODE>client</CODE> and <CODE>odbc</CODE> will be read from the <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file.
You can use all options that are usable by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.

<DT>Access
<DD>
To make Access work:

<UL>
<LI>

If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the newest
(version 2.6 or above) Microsoft MDAC (<CODE>Microsoft Data Access
Components</CODE>) from <a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/data">http://www.microsoft.com/data</a>.  This will fix
the following bug in Access: when you export data to MySQL, the
table and column names aren't specified.  Another way to around this bug
is to upgrade to MyODBC Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version
3.23.x, which together provide a workaround for this bug!

You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5)
which can be found here
<a HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP</a>.
This will fix some cases where columns are marked as <CODE>#deleted#</CODE>
in Access.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to apply the
MDAC patch and use MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and above to go around
this problem.
<LI>

Set the ``Return matching rows'' MyODBC option field when connecting to
MySQL.
<LI>

You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or updated rows
may show up as <CODE>#Deleted#</CODE>.
<LI>

You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able to update.
For maximum portability <CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE> or simple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
is recommended instead of other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> variations.
<LI>

Only use double float fields. Access fails when comparing with single floats.
The symptom usually is that new or updated rows may show up as <CODE>#Deleted#</CODE>
or that you can't find or update rows.
<LI>

If you still get the error <CODE>Another user has changed your data</CODE> after
adding a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the following trick may help you:

Don't use <CODE>table</CODE> data sheet view. Create instead a form with the
fields you want, and use that <CODE>form</CODE> data sheet view.  You should
set the <CODE>DefaultValue</CODE> property for the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to
<CODE>NOW()</CODE>.  It may be a good idea to hide the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column
from view so your users are not confused.
<LI>

Access on NT will report <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns as <CODE>OLE OBJECTS</CODE>. If
you want to have <CODE>MEMO</CODE> columns instead, you should change the
column to <CODE>TEXT</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

Access can't always handle <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns properly. If you have a problem
with these, change the columns to <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>.
<LI>

In some cases, Access may generate illegal SQL queries that
MySQL can't understand. You can fix this by selecting
<CODE>"Query|SQLSpecific|Pass-Through"</CODE> from the Access menu.
<LI>

If you have in Access a column defined as BYTE, Access will try to export this
as <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> instead of <CODE>TINYINT UNSIGNED</CODE>.  This will give you
problems if you have values &#62; 127 in the column!
<LI>

If you are using Access 7.0, You should use the option flag <CODE>Return
matching rows</CODE>.
<LI>

If you are using Access 2.0, You should use the option flags <CODE>Return
matching rows</CODE> and <CODE>Simulate ODBC 1.0</CODE>.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1504"></A>
<DT>ADO
<DD>
When you are coding with the ADO API and <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> you need to put
attention in some default properties that aren't supported by the
MySQL server.  For example, using the <CODE>CursorLocation
Property</CODE> as <CODE>adUseServer</CODE> will return for the <CODE>RecordCount
Property</CODE> a result of -1. To have the right value, you need to set this
property to <CODE>adUseClient</CODE>, like is showing in the VB code below:


<PRE>
Dim myconn As New ADODB.Connection
Dim myrs As New Recordset
Dim mySQL As String
Dim myrows As Long

myconn.Open "DSN=MyODBCsample"
mySQL = "SELECT * from user"
myrs.Source = mySQL
Set myrs.ActiveConnection = myconn
myrs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
myrs.Open
myrows = myrs.RecordCount

myrs.Close
myconn.Close
</PRE>

Another workaround is to use a <CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)</CODE> statement
for a similar query to get the correct row count.

<DT>Active server pages (ASP)
<DD>
You should use the option flag <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<DT>BDE applications
<DD>
To get these to work, you should set the option flags
<CODE>Don't optimize column widths</CODE> and <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1505"></A>
<DT>Borland Builder 4
<DD>
When you start a query you can use the property <CODE>Active</CODE> or use the
method <CODE>Open</CODE>.  Note that <CODE>Active</CODE> will start by automatically
issuing a <CODE>SELECT * FROM ...</CODE> query that may not be a good thing if
your tables are big!
<DT>ColdFusion (On Unix)
<DD>
The following information is taken from the ColdFusion documentation:

Use the following information to configure ColdFusion Server for Linux
to use the unixODBC driver with <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> for MySQL data
sources.  Allaire has verified that <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> Version 2.50.26
works with MySQL Version 3.22.27 and ColdFusion for Linux. (Any
newer version should also work.) You can download <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>

<A NAME="IDX1506"></A>
ColdFusion Version 4.5.1 allows you to us the ColdFusion Administrator
to add the MySQL data source. However, the driver is not
included with ColdFusion Version 4.5.1. Before the MySQL driver
will appear in the ODBC datasources drop-down list, you must build and
copy the <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> driver to
<TT>`/opt/coldfusion/lib/libmyodbc.so'</TT>.

The Contrib directory contains the program mydsn-xxx.zip which allows
you to build and remove the DSN registry file for the MyODBC driver
on Coldfusion applications.

<A NAME="IDX1507"></A>
<DT>DataJunction
<DD>
You have to change it to output <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, as
it exports the latter in a manner that causes MySQL grief.
<A NAME="IDX1508"></A>
<DT>Excel
<DD>
Works. Some tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have problems with dates, try to select them as strings using the
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> function. For example:

<PRE>
select CONCAT(rise_time), CONCAT(set_time)
    from sunrise_sunset;
</PRE>

Values retrieved as strings this way should be correctly recognized
as time values by Excel97.

The purpose of <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> in this example is to fool ODBC into thinking
the column is of ``string type''. Without the <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>, ODBC knows the
column is of time type, and Excel does not understand that.

Note that this is a bug in Excel, because it automatically converts a
string to a time. This would be great if the source was a text file, but
is plain stupid when the source is an ODBC connection that reports
exact types for each column.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
<DT>Word
<DD>
To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
use the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:


<UL>
<LI>

Insert rows using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client command-line tool.
<LI>

Create a DSN file using the MyODBC driver, for example, my for the db above.
<LI>

Open the Word application.
<LI>

Create a blank new documentation.
<LI>

Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert database.
<LI>

Press the button Get Data.
<LI>

At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms Query.
<LI>

In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file my.
<LI>

Select the new query.
<LI>

Select the columns that you want.
<LI>

Make a filter if you want.
<LI>

Make a Sort if you want.
<LI>

Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.
<LI>

Click Finish.
<LI>

Click Insert data and select the records.
<LI>

Click OK and you see the rows in your Word document.

Tested with BDE Version 3.0. The only known problem is that when the table
schema changes, query fields are not updated. BDE, however, does not seem
to recognize primary keys, only the index PRIMARY, though this has not
been a problem.

You should use the option flag <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<DT>Visual Basic
<DD>
To be able to update a table, you must define a primary key for the table.

Visual Basic with ADO can't handle big integers. This means that some queries
like <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> will not work properly.  The fix is to set
add the option <CODE>OPTION=16834</CODE> in the ODBC connect string or set
the <CODE>Change BIGINT columns to INT</CODE> option in the MyODBC connect screen.
You may also want to set the <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE> option.

<DT>VisualInterDev
<DD>
If you get the error <CODE>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver does
not support this parameter</CODE> the reason may be that you have a
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> in your result.  Try setting the <CODE>Change BIGINT
columns to INT</CODE> option in the MyODBC connect screen.

<DT>Visual Objects

You should use the option flag <CODE>Don't optimize column widths</CODE>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1514"></A>

</P>
<P>
A common problem is how to get the value of an automatically generated ID
from an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>. With ODBC, you can do something like this (assuming
that <CODE>auto</CODE> is an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field):

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you are just going to insert the ID into another table, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_unique_ID">8.4.5.3  How Can I Get the Unique ID for the Last Inserted Row?</A>.

</P>
<P>
For the benefit of some ODBC applications (at least Delphi and Access),
the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL;
</PRE>

If you encounter difficulties with <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>, you should start by
making a log file from the ODBC manager (the log you get when requesting
logs from ODBCADMIN) and a <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> log.

</P>
<P>
To get a <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> log, you need to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Ensure that you are using <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE> and not <CODE>myodbc.dll</CODE>.
The easiest way to do this is to get <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE> from the MyODBC
distribution and copy it over the <CODE>myodbc.dll</CODE>, which is probably
in your <CODE>C:\windows\system32</CODE> or <CODE>C:\winnt\system32</CODE> directory.

Note that you probably want to restore the old myodbc.dll file when you
have finished testing, as this is a lot faster than <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE>.
<LI>

Tag the `Trace MyODBC' option flag in the <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> connect/configure
screen.  The log will be written to file <TT>`C:\myodbc.log'</TT>.

If the trace option is not remembered when you are going back to the
above screen, it means that you are not using the <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE>
driver (see above).
<LI>

Start your application and try to get it to fail.
</OL>

<P>
Check the <CODE>MyODBC trace file</CODE>, to find out what could be wrong.
You should be able to find out the issued queries by searching after
the string <CODE>&#62;mysql_real_query</CODE> in the <TT>`myodbc.log'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also try duplicating the queries in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> monitor
or <CODE>admndemo</CODE> to find out if the error is MyODBC or MySQL.

</P>
<P>
If you find out something is wrong, please only send the relevant rows
(max 40 rows) to <a HREF="mailto:myodbc@lists.mysql.com">myodbc@lists.mysql.com</a>.  Please never
send the whole MyODBC or ODBC log file!

</P>
<P>
If you are unable to find out what's wrong, the last option is to
make an archive (tar or zip) that contains a MyODBC trace file, the ODBC
log file, and a README file that explains the problem.  You can send this
to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret</a>.  Only we at 
MySQL AB will have access to the files you upload, and we will
be very discrete with the data!

</P>
<P>
If you can create a program that also shows this problem, please
upload this too!

</P>
<P>
If the program works with some other SQL server, you should make an ODBC log
file where you do exactly the same thing in the other SQL server.

</P>
<P>
Remember that the more information you can supply to us, the more
likely it is that we can fix the problem!

<H2><A NAME="C" HREF="manual_toc.html#C">8.4  MySQL C API</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1518"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1519"></A>

</P>

<P>
The C API code is distributed with MySQL. It is included in the
<CODE>mysqlclient</CODE> library and allows C programs to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Many of the clients in the MySQL source distribution are
written in C.  If you are looking for examples that demonstrate how to
use the C API, take a look at these clients. You can find these in the
<CODE>clients</CODE> directory in the MySQL source distribution.

</P>
<P>
Most of the other client APIs (all except Java) use the <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>
library to communicate with the MySQL server. This means that, for
example, you can take advantage of many of the same environment variables
that are used by other client programs, because they are referenced from the
library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Client-Side_Scripts">4.8  MySQL Client-Side Scripts and Utilities</A>, for a list of these variables.

</P>
<P>
The client has a maximum communication buffer size. The size of the buffer
that is allocated initially (16K bytes) is automatically increased up to the
maximum size (the maximum is 16M). Because buffer sizes are increased
only as demand warrants, simply increasing the default maximum limit does not
in itself cause more resources to be used. This size check is mostly a check
for erroneous queries and communication packets.

</P>
<P>
The communication buffer must be large enough to contain a single SQL
statement (for client-to-server traffic) and one row of returned data (for
server-to-client traffic).  Each thread's communication buffer is dynamically
enlarged to handle any query or row up to the maximum limit.  For example, if
you have <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values that contain up to 16M of data, you must have a
communication buffer limit of at least 16M (in both server and client).  The
client's default maximum is 16M, but the default maximum in the server is
1M.  You can increase this by changing the value of the
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> parameter when the server is started.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server shrinks each communication buffer to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes after each query.  For clients, the size of
the buffer associated with a connection is not decreased until the connection
is closed, at which time client memory is reclaimed.

</P>
<P>
For programming with threads, consult the 'how to make a thread-safe
client' chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.7  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.

This structure represents a handle to one database connection. It is
used for almost all MySQL functions.

<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE>
<DD>
This structure represents the result of a query that returns rows
(<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).  The
information returned from a query is called the <EM>result set</EM> in the
remainder of this section.

<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is currently
implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You cannot treat these as
null-terminated strings if field values may contain binary data, because such
values may contain null bytes internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1523"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>
<DD>
This structure contains information about a field, such as the field's
name, type, and size. Its members are described in more detail below.
You may obtain the <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structures for each field by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly.  Field values are not part of
this structure; they are contained in a <CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE> structure.

<A NAME="IDX1524"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of an offset into a MySQL field
list.  (Used by <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.)  Offsets are field numbers
within a row, beginning at zero.

<A NAME="IDX1525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>
<DT><CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
<DD>
The type used for the number of rows and for <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>, and <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>. This type provides a
range of <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.84e19</CODE>.

On some systems, attempting to print a value of type <CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
will not work.  To print such a value, convert it to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>
and use a <CODE>%lu</CODE> print format.  Example:

<PRE>
printf (Number of rows: %lu\n", (unsigned long) mysql_num_rows(result));

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>char * name</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the field, as a null-terminated string.

<DT><CODE>char * table</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the table containing this field, if it isn't a calculated field.
For calculated fields, the <CODE>table</CODE> value is an empty string.

<DT><CODE>char * def</CODE>
<DD>
The default value of this field, as a null-terminated string.  This is set
only if you use <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>enum enum_field_types type</CODE>

</TABLE>

You can use the <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> macro to test whether or not a field has a
numeric type.  Pass the <CODE>type</CODE> value to <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> and it
will evaluate to TRUE if the field is numeric:


<PRE>
if (IS_NUM(field-&#62;type))
    printf("Field is numeric\n");
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int length</CODE>
<DD>
The width of the field, as specified in the table definition.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum width of the field for the result set (the length of the longest
field value for the rows actually in the result set). If you use
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>, this contains the
maximum length for the field.  If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, the
value of this variable is zero.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int flags</CODE>
<DD>
Different bit-flags for the field.  The <CODE>flags</CODE> value may have zero
or more of the following bits set:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Use of the <CODE>BLOB_FLAG</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM_FLAG</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE>
flags is deprecated because they indicate the type of a field rather
than an attribute of its type.  It is preferable to test
<CODE>field-&#62;type</CODE> against <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_ENUM</CODE>, or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP</CODE> instead.

The example below illustrates a typical use of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:


<PRE>
if (field-&#62;flags &#38; NOT_NULL_FLAG)
    printf("Field can't be null\n");
</PRE>

You may use the following convenience macros to determine the boolean
status of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>IS_NOT_NULL(flags)</CODE> </TD><TD> True if this field is defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>

</TABLE>

<P>
To connect to the server, call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialize a
connection handler, then call <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> with that
handler (along with other information such as the hostname, user name,
and password).  Upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the
<CODE>reconnect</CODE> flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of
<CODE>1</CODE>. This flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be
performed because of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the
server before giving up.  When you are done with the connection, call
<CODE>mysql_close()</CODE> to terminate it.

</P>
<P>
While a connection is active, the client may send SQL queries to the server
using <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.  The difference
between the two is that <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> expects the query to be
specified as a null-terminated string whereas <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>
expects a counted string.  If the string contains binary data (which may
include null bytes), you must use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For each non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> query (for example, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>), you can find out how many rows were changed (affected)
by calling <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, you retrieve the selected rows as a result set.
(Note that some statements are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like in that they return rows.
These include <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.  They should
be treated the same way as <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.)

</P>
<P>
There are two ways for a client to process result sets.  One way is to
retrieve the entire result set all at once by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.  This function acquires from the server all the
rows returned by the query and stores them in the client.  The second way is
for the client to initiate a row-by-row result set retrieval by calling
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>.  This function initializes the retrieval, but does
not actually get any rows from the server.

</P>
<P>
In both cases, you access rows by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> accesses rows that have
already been fetched from the server.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> actually retrieves the row from the server.
Information about the size of the data in each row is available by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After you are done with a result set, call <CODE>mysql_free_result()</CODE>
to free the memory used for it.

</P>
<P>
The two retrieval mechanisms are complementary.  Client programs should
choose the approach that is most appropriate for their requirements.
In practice, clients tend to use <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> more
commonly.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is that because the rows have all
been fetched to the client, you not only can access rows sequentially, you
can move back and forth in the result set using <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE> to change the current row position within the result
set.  You can also find out how many rows there are by calling
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.  On the other hand, the memory requirements for
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> may be very high for large result sets and you
are more likely to encounter out-of-memory conditions.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> is that the client requires less
memory for the result set because it maintains only one row at a time (and
because there is less allocation overhead, <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> can be
faster).  Disadvantages are that you must process each row quickly to avoid
tying up the server, you don't have random access to rows within the result
set (you can only access rows sequentially), and you don't know how many rows
are in the result set until you have retrieved them all.  Furthermore, you
<EM>must</EM> retrieve all the rows even if you determine in mid-retrieval that
you've found the information you were looking for.

</P>
<P>
The API makes it possible for clients to respond appropriately to
queries (retrieving rows only as necessary) without knowing whether or
not the query is a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  You can do this by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> after each <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> (or
<CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>).  If the result set call succeeds, the query
was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and you can read the rows.  If the result set call
fails, call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether or not a
result was actually to be expected.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>
returns zero, the query returned no data (indicating that it was an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, etc.), and was not
expected to return rows.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> is non-zero, the
query should have returned rows, but didn't.  This indicates that the
query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that failed.  See the description for
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> for an example of how this can be done.

</P>
<P>
Both <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> allow you to
obtain information about the fields that make up the result set (the number
of fields, their names and types, etc.).  You can access field information
sequentially within the row by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly,
or by field number within the row by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_field_direct()</CODE>.  The current field cursor position may be
changed by calling <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.  Setting the field cursor
affects subsequent calls to <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE>.  You can also get
information for fields all at once by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_fields()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For detecting and reporting errors, MySQL provides access to error
information by means of the <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
functions.  These return the error code or error message for the most
recently invoked function that can succeed or fail, allowing you to determine
when an error occurred and what it was.

<P>
In the descriptions below, a parameter or return value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> means
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in the sense of the C programming language, not a
MySQL <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
Functions that return a value generally return a pointer or an integer.
Unless specified otherwise, functions returning a pointer return a
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate success or a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate
an error, and functions returning an integer return zero to indicate success
or non-zero to indicate an error.  Note that ``non-zero'' means just that.
Unless the function description says otherwise, do not test against a value
other than zero:

</P>

<PRE>
if (result)                   /* correct */
    ... error ...

if (result &#60; 0)               /* incorrect */
    ... error ...

if (result == -1)             /* incorrect */
    ... error ...
</PRE>

<P>
When a function returns an error, the <STRONG>Errors</STRONG> subsection of the
function description lists the possible types of errors.  You can
find out which of these occurred by calling <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.
A string representation of the error may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.

<H4>8.4.3.2  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of rows changed by the last <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, deleted by
the last <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or inserted by the last <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement. May be called immediately after <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> for
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  For
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> works like
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.3  Return Values</H4>

<P>
An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected or
retrieved.  Zero indicates that no records where updated for an
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, no rows matched the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the
query or that no query has yet been executed.  -1 indicates that the
query returned an error or that, for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> was called prior to calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.4  Errors</H4>

<P>
If one specifies the flag <CODE>CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> when connecting to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return the number of
rows matched by the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement for <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Note that when one uses a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return 2 if the new row replaced and
old row.  This is because in this case one row was inserted and then the
duplicate was deleted.

<H4>8.4.3.7  Description</H4>
<P>

<P>
This function is deprecated.  It is preferable to use
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL
database engine running on <CODE>host</CODE>.  <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> must complete
successfully before you can execute any of the other API functions, with the
exception of <CODE>mysql_get_client_info()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The meanings of the parameters are the same as for the corresponding
parameters for <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> with the difference that the
connection parameter may be <CODE>NULL</CODE>. In this case the C API
allocates memory for the connection structure automatically and frees it
when you call <CODE>mysql_close()</CODE>. The disadvantage of this approach is
that you can't retrieve an error message if the connection fails.  (To
get error information from <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>,
you must provide a valid <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> pointer.)

<P>
<CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE> fails unless the connected user can be

<H4>8.4.3.47  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is deprecated.  <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
may be used instead.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> determines whether or not the last row of a result
set has been read.

</P>
<P>
If you acquire a result set from a successful call to
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, the client receives the entire set in one
operation.  In this case, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return from <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>
always means the end of the result set has been reached and it is
unnecessary to call <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> to initiate a result
set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by one as
you call <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> repeatedly.  Because an error may occur on
the connection during this process, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return value from
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> does not necessarily mean the end of the result set
was reached normally.  In this case, you can use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> to
determine what happened.  <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns a non-zero value if the
end of the result set was reached and zero if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
Historically, <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> predates the standard MySQL error
functions <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.  Because those error
functions provide the same information, their use is preferred over
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>, which is now deprecated.  (In fact, they provide more
information, because <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns only a boolean value whereas
the error functions indicate a reason for the error when one occurs.)

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.48  Return Values</H4>

<P>
Zero if no error occurred. Non-zero if the end of the result set has been
reached.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.49  Errors</H4>
<P>
None.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.50  Example</H4>

<P>
The following example shows how you might use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
{
    // do something with data
}
if(!mysql_eof(result))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&#38;mysql));
}
</PRE>

<P>
However, you can achieve the same effect with the standard MySQL
error functions:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
{
    // do something with data
}
if(mysql_errno(&#38;mysql))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&#38;mysql));

<P>
For the connection specified by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> returns
the error code for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  A return value of zero means that no error occurred. Client error
message numbers are listed in the MySQL <TT>`errmsg.h'</TT> header file.
Server error message numbers are listed in <TT>`mysqld_error.h'</TT>. In the
MySQL source distribution you can find a complete list of
error messages and error numbers in the file <TT>`Docs/mysqld_error.txt'</TT>.

<H4>8.4.3.56  Description</H4>

<P>
For the connection specified by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> returns
the error message for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  An empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) is returned if no error occurred.
This means the following two tests are equivalent:

<P>
If you've called <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> to perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a table

for the length of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> field.  (The 8K size is chosen because
MySQL doesn't know the maximum length for the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>. This
should be made configurable sometime.) Once you've retrieved the result set,
<CODE>field-&#62;max_length</CODE> contains the length of the largest value for this

Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row within a result set.
If you plan to copy field values, this length information is also useful for
optimization, because you can avoid calling <CODE>strlen()</CODE>.  In addition, if
the result set contains binary data, you <EM>must</EM> use this function to
determine the size of the data, because <CODE>strlen()</CODE> returns incorrect
results for any field containing null characters.

Retrieves the next row of a result set. When used after
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>
when there are no more rows to retrieve.  When used after
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> when
there are no more rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
The number of values in the row is given by <CODE>mysql_num_fields(result)</CODE>.

indicated by <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointers.

</P>
<P>
The lengths of the field values in the row may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.  Empty fields and fields containing
<CODE>NULL</CODE> both have length 0; you can distinguish these by checking
the pointer for the field value.  If the pointer is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the field
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>; otherwise the field is empty.

<H4>8.4.3.86  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of columns for the most recent query on the connection.

</P>
<P>
The normal use of this function is when <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
returned <CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).
In this case, you can call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to
determine whether or not <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a
non-empty result.  This allows the client program to take proper action
without knowing whether or not the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The example shown below illustrates how this
may be done.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> if the previous query
does not generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value.  If you need to save
the value for later, be sure to call <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> immediately
after the query that generates the value.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is updated after <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value or
that set a column value to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.5.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
Also note that the value of the SQL <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function always
contains the most recently generated <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value, and is
not reset between queries because the value of that function is maintained
in the server.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.128  Return Values</H4>

<P>
The value of the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field that was updated by the previous

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.151  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of columns in a result set.

</P>
<P>
Note that you can get the number of columns either from a pointer to a result
set or to a connection handle.  You would use the connection handle if
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> returned
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you can
call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether or not
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether or
not the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The
example shown below illustrates how this may be done.

<H4>8.4.3.172  Description</H4>

<P>
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a
MySQL database engine running on <CODE>host</CODE>.
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> must complete successfully before you can execute
any of the other API functions, with the exception of
<CODE>mysql_get_client_info()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The parameters are specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first parameter should be the address of an existing <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
structure.  Before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> you must call
<CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialize the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure. You can
change a lot of connect options with the <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>
call. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_options">8.4.3.159  <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>host</CODE> may be either a hostname or an IP address.  If
<CODE>host</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> or the string <CODE>"localhost"</CODE>, a connection to
the local host is assumed. If the OS supports sockets (Unix) or named pipes
(Windows), they are used instead of TCP/IP to connect to the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> parameter contains the user's MySQL login ID.  If
<CODE>user</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the current user is assumed.  Under Unix, this is
the current login name.  Under Windows ODBC, the current user name must be
specified explicitly.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">8.3.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>passwd</CODE> parameter contains the password for <CODE>user</CODE>.  If
<CODE>passwd</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, only entries in the <CODE>user</CODE> table for the
user that have a blank (empty) password field will be checked for a match. This
allows the database administrator to set up the MySQL privilege
system in such a way that users get different privileges depending on whether
or not they have specified a password.

NOTE: Do not attempt to encrypt the password before calling
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>; password encryption is handled automatically by
the client API.

<LI>

<CODE>db</CODE> is the database name.
If <CODE>db</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the connection will set the default
database to this value.

<LI>

If <CODE>port</CODE> is not 0, the value will be used as the port number
for the TCP/IP connection.  Note that the <CODE>host</CODE> parameter
determines the type of the connection.

<PRE>
MYSQL mysql;

mysql_init(&#38;mysql);
mysql_options(&#38;mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"your_prog_name");

<P>
By using <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the MySQL library will read the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> and <CODE>your_prog_name</CODE> sections in the <CODE>my.cnf</CODE>
file which will ensure that your program will work, even if someone has
set up MySQL in some non-standard way.

</P>
<P>
Note that upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the <CODE>reconnect</CODE>
flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of <CODE>1</CODE>. This flag indicates,
in the event that a query cannot be performed because of a lost connection, to
try reconnecting to the server before giving up.

<CODE>unsigned int mysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to, const char *from, unsigned int length)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.177  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is used to create a legal SQL string that you can use in a
SQL statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_syntax">6.1.1.1  Strings</A>.

</P>
<P>
The string in <CODE>from</CODE> is encoded to an escaped SQL string, taking
into account the current character set of the connection. The result is placed
in <CODE>to</CODE> and a terminating null byte is appended.  Characters
encoded are <CODE>NUL</CODE> (ASCII 0), <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`''</SAMP>, <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>, and Control-Z (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>).

</P>
<P>
The string pointed to by <CODE>from</CODE> must be <CODE>length</CODE> bytes long.  You
must allocate the <CODE>to</CODE> buffer to be at least <CODE>length*2+1</CODE> bytes
long.  (In the worse case, each character may need to be encoded as using two
bytes, and you need room for the terminating null byte.)  When
<CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> returns, the contents of <CODE>to</CODE> will be a
null-terminated string.  The return value is the length of the encoded
string, not including the terminating null character.

You should not add a terminating semicolon (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) or <CODE>\g</CODE> to the

</P>
<P>
You <EM>must</EM> use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE> rather than
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> for queries that contain binary data, because binary data

is faster than <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> because it does not call <CODE>strlen()</CODE> on
the query string.

If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you can
use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to check for this.

<H4>8.4.3.210  Description</H4>

<P>
You must call <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
for every query that successfully retrieves data (<CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You don't have to call <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> for other queries, but it will not do any
harm or cause any notable performance if you call <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
in all cases.  You can detect if the query didn't have a result set by
checking if <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> returns 0 (more about this later one).

</P>
<P>
If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you can
use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to check for this.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> reads the entire result of a query to the client,
allocates a <CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE> structure, and places the result into this
structure.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_store_results()</CODE> returns a null pointer if the query didn't return
a result set (if the query was, for example, an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_store_results()</CODE> also returns a null pointer if reading of the
result set failed. You can check if you got an error by checking if
<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> doesn't return a null pointer, if
<CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> returns &#60;&#62; 0, or if <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>
returns &#60;&#62; 0.

</P>
<P>
An empty result set is returned if there are no rows returned.  (An empty
result set differs from a null pointer as a return value.)

</P>
<P>
Once you have called <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> and got a result back
that isn't a null pointer, you may call <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> to find
out how many rows are in the result set.

</P>
<P>
You can call <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> to fetch rows from the result set,

<CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> initiates a result set retrieval but does not
actually read the result set into the client like <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
does.  Instead, each row must be retrieved individually by making calls to
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  This reads the result of a query directly from the
server without storing it in a temporary table or local buffer, which is
somewhat faster and uses much less memory than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
The client will only allocate memory for the current row and a communication
buffer that may grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you shouldn't use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> if you are
doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side, or if the output
is sent to a screen on which the user may type a <CODE>^S</CODE> (stop scroll).
This will tie up the server and prevent other threads from updating any
tables from which the data is being fetched.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, you must execute
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> until a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is returned, otherwise the
unfetched rows will be returned as part of the result set for your next
query. The C API will give the error <CODE>Commands out of sync; You can't
run this command now</CODE> if you forget to do this!

</P>
<P>
You may not use <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_row_tell()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>, or
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> with a result returned from
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, nor may you issue other queries until the
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> has finished.  (However, after you have fetched all
the rows, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> will accurately return the number of rows
fetched.)

<H4>8.4.4.2  Description</H4>

<P>
This function needs to be called once in the program before calling any
MySQL function.  This initializes some global variables that MySQL
needs.  If you are using a thread safe client library, this will also
call <CODE>my_thread_init()</CODE> for this thread.

<P>
It is possible for <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>
following a successful call to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.  When this happens, it
means one of the following conditions occurred:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There was a <CODE>malloc()</CODE> failure (for example, if the result set was too
large).

<LI>

The data couldn't be read (an error occurred on the connection).

<LI>

The query returned no data (for example, it was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
You can always check whether or not the statement should have produced a
non-empty result by calling <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>.  If
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns zero, the result is empty and the last
query was a statement that does not return values (for example, an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns a
non-zero value, the statement should have produced a non-empty result.
See the description of the <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> function for an
example.

</P>
<P>
You can test for an error by calling <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="Query_results" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_results">8.4.5.2  What Results Can I Get From a Query?</A></H4>

<P>
In addition to the result set returned by a query, you can also get the
following information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows affected by the last
query when doing an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>. An
exception is that if <CODE>DELETE</CODE> is used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, the
table is re-created empty, which is much faster! In this case,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns zero for the number of records
affected.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows in a result set.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called as soon as
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> returns.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called only after you have fetched all the
rows with <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns the ID generated by the last
query that inserted a row into a table with an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.126  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

Some queries (<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ...</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT INTO
... SELECT ...</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>) return additional information.  The result is
returned by <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>.  See the description for <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
for the format of the string that it returns.  <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> returns a
<CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer if there is no additional information.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1591"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you insert a record in a table containing a column that has the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute, you can get the most recently generated
ID by calling the <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
You can also retrieve the ID by using the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function in
a query string that you pass to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check if an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index is used by executing
the following code. This also checks if the query was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with
an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index:

</P>

<PRE>
if (mysql_error(&#38;mysql)[0] == 0 &#38;&
    mysql_num_fields(result) == 0 &#38;&
    mysql_insert_id(&#38;mysql) != 0)
{
    used_id = mysql_insert_id(&#38;mysql);
}
</PRE>

<P>
The most recently generated ID is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert
it into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
    VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table

If you compile MySQL clients that you've written yourself or that
you obtain from a third party, they must be linked using the
<CODE>-lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> option on the link command.  You may also need to
specify a <CODE>-L</CODE> option to tell the linker where to find the library.  For
example, if the library is installed in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/lib'</TT>, use
<CODE>-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> on the link command.

</P>
<P>
For clients that use MySQL header files, you may need to specify a
<CODE>-I</CODE> option when you compile them (for example,
<CODE>-I/usr/local/mysql/include</CODE>), so the compiler can find the header
files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Threaded_clients" HREF="manual_toc.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.7  How to Make a Threaded Client</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1598"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1599"></A>

</P>
<P>
The client library is almost thread safe. The biggest problem is
that the subroutines in <TT>`net.c'</TT> that read from sockets are not
interrupt safe.  This was done with the thought that you might want to
have your own alarm that can break a long read to a server.  If you
install interrupt handlers for the <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> interrupt,
the socket handling should be thread safe.

</P>
<P>
In the older binaries we distribute on our Web site, the client
libraries are not normally compiled with the thread-safe option (the
Windows binaries are by default compiled to be thread safe).
Newer binary distributions should have both a normal and a
thread-safe client library.

</P>
<P>
To get a threaded client where you can interrupt the client from other
threads and set timeouts when talking with the MySQL server, you should
use the <CODE>-lmysys</CODE>, <CODE>-lstring</CODE>, and <CODE>-ldbug</CODE> libraries and
the <CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> code that the server uses.

</P>
<P>
If you don't need interrupts or timeouts, you can just compile a thread
safe client library <CODE>(mysqlclient_r)</CODE> and use this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#C">8.4  MySQL C API</A>.  In this case you don't have to worry about the
<CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> object file or the other MySQL libraries.

</P>
<P>
When using a threaded client and you want to use timeouts and
interrupts, you can make great use of the routines in the
<TT>`thr_alarm.c'</TT> file.  If you are using routines from the
<CODE>mysys</CODE> library, the only thing you must remember is to call
<CODE>my_init()</CODE> first! See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_Thread_functions">8.4.4  C Threaded Function Descriptions</A>.

</P>
<P>
All functions except <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> are by default
thread safe.  The following notes describe how to compile a thread safe
client library and use it in a thread-safe manner.  (The notes below for
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> actually apply to <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> as
well, but because <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> is deprecated, you should be
using <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> anyway.)

</P>
<P>
To make <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> thread safe, you must recompile the
client library with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --enable-thread-safe-client
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a thread-safe client library <CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE>.
<CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE>.  This library is thread safe per
connection.  You can let two threads share the same connection as long
as you do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Two threads can't send a query to the MySQL at the same time on
the same connection.  In particular, you have to ensure that between a
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> no other thread is using
the same connection.
<LI>

Many threads can access different result sets that are retrieved with
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result</CODE>, you have to ensure that no other thread
is asking anything on the same connection until the result set is closed.
However, it really is best for threaded clients that share the same
connection to use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you want to use multiple threads on the same connection, you must
have a mutex lock around your <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> call combination.  Once
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is ready, the lock can be released and other
threads may query the same connection.
<LI>

If you program with POSIX threads, you can use
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and <CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> to
establish and release a mutex lock.
</UL>

<P>
You need to know the following if you have a thread that is calling
MySQL functions, but that thread has not created the connection to the
MySQL database:

</P>
<P>
When you call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, MySQL will
create a thread specific variable for the thread that is used by the
debug library (among other things).

</P>
<P>
If you have in a thread call a MySQL function, before a thread has
called <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, the thread will
not have the necessary thread specific variables in place and you are
likely to end up with a core dump sooner or later.
 
The get things to work smoothly you have to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>my_init()</CODE> at the start of your program if it calls
any other MySQL function before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
<LI>

Call <CODE>my_thread_init()</CODE> in the thread handler before calling
any MySQL function.
<LI>

In the thread, call <CODE>my_thread_end()</CODE> before calling
<CODE>pthread_exit()</CODE>.  This will free the memory used by MySQL thread
specific variables.
</OL>

<P>
You may get some errors because of undefined symbols when linking your
client with <CODE>mysqlclient_r</CODE>. In most cases this is because you haven't
included the thread libraries on the link/compile line.

There are two ways to add new functions to MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>You can add the function through the user-definable function (UDF)

interface.  User-definable functions are added and removed dynamically using
the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_FUNCTION">9.1.1  <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION/DROP FUNCTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>You can add the function as a native (built in) MySQL function.

Native functions are compiled into the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and become
available on a permanent basis.
</UL>

<P>
Each method has advantages and disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you write a user-definable function, you must install the object file
in addition to the server itself.  If you compile your function into the
server, you don't need to do that.
<LI>

You can add UDFs to a binary MySQL distribution.  Native functions
require you to modify a source distribution.
<LI>

If you upgrade your MySQL distribution, you can continue to use your
previously installed UDFs.  For native functions, you must repeat your
modifications each time you upgrade.
</UL>

<P>
Whichever method you use to add new functions, they may be used just like
native functions such as <CODE>ABS()</CODE> or <CODE>SOUNDEX()</CODE>.

<P>
A user-definable function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like native (built in) MySQL functions such as
<CODE>ABS()</CODE> and <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> is a new option for MySQL Version 3.23.  An
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> function works exactly like a native MySQL
<CODE>GROUP</CODE> function like <CODE>SUM</CODE> or <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> saves the function's name, type, and shared library
name in the <CODE>mysql.func</CODE> system table.  You must have the
<STRONG>insert</STRONG> and <STRONG>delete</STRONG> privileges for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
All active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In
this case, UDF initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.
(An active function is one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>
and not removed with <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
For instructions on writing user-definable functions, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_functions">9.1  Adding New Functions to MySQL</A>.  For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or
C++, your operating system must support dynamic loading and you must have
compiled <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dynamically (not statically).

<P>
For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or C++ and your
operating system must support dynamic loading.  The MySQL source
distribution includes a file <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that defines 5 new
functions.  Consult this file to see how UDF calling conventions work.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be able to use UDF functions, you should configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic</CODE> The reason is that to on
many platforms (including Linux) you can load a dynamic library (with
<CODE>dlopen()</CODE>) from a static linked program, which you would get if
you are using <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> If you want to
use an UDF that needs to access symbols from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (like the
<CODE>methaphone</CODE> example in <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that uses
<CODE>default_charset_info</CODE>), you must link the program with
<CODE>-rdynamic</CODE>.  (see <CODE>man dlopen</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For each function that you want to use in SQL statements, you should define
corresponding C (or C++) functions.  In the discussion below, the name
``xxx'' is used for an example function name.  To distinquish between SQL and
C/C++ usage, <CODE>XXX()</CODE> (uppercase) indicates a SQL function call, and
<CODE>xxx()</CODE> (lowercase) indicates a C/C++ function call.

</P>
<P>
The C/C++ functions that you write to implement the interface for
<CODE>XXX()</CODE> are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>xxx()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
The main function.  This is where the function result is computed.
The correspondence between the SQL type and return type of your C/C++
function is shown below:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>SQL type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>C/C++ type</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>REAL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>double</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The initialization function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It can be used to:


<UL>
<LI>

Check the number of arguments to <CODE>XXX()</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that the arguments are of a required type or, alternatively,
tell MySQL to coerce arguments to the types you want when
the main function is called.
<LI>

Allocate any memory required by the main function.
<LI>

Specify the maximum length of the result.
<LI>

Specify (for <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions) the maximum number of decimals.
<LI>

Specify whether or not the result can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<DT><CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The deinitialization function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It should deallocate any
memory allocated by the initialization function.
</DL>

<P>
When a SQL statement invokes <CODE>XXX()</CODE>, MySQL calls the
initialization function <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> to let it perform any required
setup, such as argument checking or memory allocation.  If <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
returns an error, the SQL statement is aborted with an error message and the
main and deinitialization functions are not called.  Otherwise, the main
function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is called once for each row.  After all rows have been
processed, the deinitialization function <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> is called so it
can perform any required cleanup.

</P>
<P>
All functions must be thread safe (not just the main function,
but the initialization and deinitialization functions as well). This means
that you are not allowed to allocate any global or static variables that
change!  If you need memory, you should allocate it in <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
and free it in <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>.

The main function should be declared as shown below.  Note that the return
type and parameters differ, depending on whether you will declare the SQL
function <CODE>XXX()</CODE> to return <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, or <CODE>REAL</CODE>
in the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> statement:

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>STRING</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *result, unsigned long *length,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
long long xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
double xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
The initialization and deinitialization functions are declared like this:

</P>

<PRE>
my_bool xxx_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message);

void xxx_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid);
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>initid</CODE> parameter is passed to all three functions.  It points to a
<CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure that is used to communicate information between
functions.  The <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure members are listed below.  The
initialization function should fill in any members that it wishes to change.
(To use the default for a member, leave it unchanged.):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>my_bool maybe_null</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should set <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>xxx()</CODE>
can return <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  The default value is <CODE>1</CODE> if any of the
arguments are declared <CODE>maybe_null</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int decimals</CODE>
<DD>
Number of decimals.  The default value is the maximum number of decimals in
the arguments passed to the main function.  (For example, if the function is
passed <CODE>1.34</CODE>, <CODE>1.345</CODE>, and <CODE>1.3</CODE>, the default would be 3,
because <CODE>1.345</CODE> has 3 decimals.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum length of the string result.  The default value differs depending
on the result type of the function.  For string functions, the default is the
length of the longest argument.  For integer functions, the default is 21
digits.  For real functions, the default is 13 plus the number of decimals
indicated by <CODE>initid-&#62;decimals</CODE>.  (For numeric functions, the length
includes any sign or decimal point characters.)

<DT><CODE>char *ptr</CODE>
<DD>
A pointer that the function can use for its own purposes.  For example,
functions can use <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to communicate allocated memory
between functions.  In <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>, allocate the memory and assign it
to this pointer:


<PRE>
initid-&#62;ptr = allocated_memory;
</PRE>

In <CODE>xxx()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>, refer to <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to use
or deallocate the memory.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>args</CODE> parameter points to a <CODE>UDF_ARGS</CODE> structure that thas the
members listed below:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int arg_count</CODE>
<DD>
The number of arguments.  Check this value in the initialization function
if you want your function to be called with a particular number of arguments.
For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_count != 2)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires two arguments");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>enum Item_result *arg_type</CODE>
<DD>
The types for each argument.  The possible type values are
<CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, and <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>.

To make sure that arguments are of a given type and return an
error if they are not, check the <CODE>arg_type</CODE> array in the initialization
function.  For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT ||
    args-&#62;arg_type[1] != INT_RESULT)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires a string and an integer");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

As an alternative to requiring your function's arguments to be of particular
types, you can use the initialization function to set the <CODE>arg_type</CODE>
elements to the types you want.  This causes MySQL to coerce
arguments to those types for each call to <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  For example, to
specify coercion of the first two arguments to string and integer, do this in
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>:


<PRE>
args-&#62;arg_type[0] = STRING_RESULT;
args-&#62;arg_type[1] = INT_RESULT;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>char **args</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> communicates information to the initialization function
about the general nature of the arguments your function was called with.  For a
constant argument <CODE>i</CODE>, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> points to the argument
value.  (See below for instructions on how to access the value properly.)
For a non-constant argument, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>.
A constant argument is an expression that uses only constants, such as
<CODE>3</CODE> or <CODE>4*7-2</CODE> or <CODE>SIN(3.14)</CODE>.  A non-constant argument is an
expression that refers to values that may change from row to row, such as
column names or functions that are called with non-constant arguments.

For each invocation of the main function, <CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> contains the
actual arguments that are passed for the row currently being processed.

Functions can refer to an argument <CODE>i</CODE> as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

An argument of type <CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE> is given as a string pointer plus a
length, to allow handling of binary data or data of arbitrary length.  The
string contents are available as <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> and the string length
is <CODE>args-&#62;lengths[i]</CODE>.  You should not assume that strings are
null-terminated.

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>long long</CODE> value:


<PRE>
long long int_val;
int_val = *((long long*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>double</CODE> value:


<PRE>
double    real_val;
real_val = *((double*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT><CODE>unsigned long *lengths</CODE>
<DD>
For the initialization function, the <CODE>lengths</CODE> array indicates the
maximum string length for each argument.  For each invocation of the main
function, <CODE>lengths</CODE> contains the actual lengths of any string arguments
that are passed for the row currently being processed.  For arguments of
types <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE> or <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>lengths</CODE> still contains
the maximum length of the argument (as for the initialization function).

The initialization function should return <CODE>0</CODE> if no error occurred and
<CODE>1</CODE> otherwise.  If an error occurs, <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should store a
null-terminated error message in the <CODE>message</CODE> parameter.  The message
will be returned to the client.  The message buffer is
<CODE>MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE</CODE> characters long, but you should try to keep the
message to less than 80 characters so that it fits the width of a standard
terminal screen.

</P>
<P>
The return value of the main function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is the function value, for
<CODE>long long</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> functions.  A string functions should
return a pointer to the result and store the length of the string in the
<CODE>length</CODE> arguments. <CODE>result</CODE> is a buffer at least 255 bytes long.
Set these to the contents and length of the return value.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
memcpy(result, "result string", 13);
*length = 13;
</PRE>

<P>
If your string functions that needs to return a string longer than 255
bytes, you must allocate the space for it with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> in your
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> function or your <CODE>xxx()</CODE> function and free it in
your <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> function.  You can store the allocated memory
in the <CODE>ptr</CODE> slot in the <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure for reuse by
future <CODE>xxx()</CODE> calls.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_calling_sequences">9.1.2.1  UDF Calling Sequences</A>.

<P>
To indicate an error return in the main function, set the <CODE>error</CODE>

Files implementing UDFs must be compiled and installed on the host where the
server runs.  This process is described below for the example UDF file
<TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT> that is included in the MySQL source
distribution.  This file contains the following functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>metaphon()</CODE> returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for English.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_double()</CODE> returns the sum of the ASCII values of the
characters in its arguments, divided by the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_int()</CODE> returns the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>sequence([const int])</CODE> returns an sequence starting from the given
number or 1 if no number has been given.
<LI>

<CODE>lookup()</CODE> returns the IP number for a hostname.
<LI>

<CODE>reverse_lookup()</CODE> returns the hostname for an IP number.
The function may be called with a string <CODE>"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"</CODE> or
four numbers.
</UL>

<P>
A dynamically loadable file should be compiled as a sharable object file,
using a command something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -shared -o udf_example.so myfunc.cc
</PRE>

<P>
You can easily find out the correct compiler options for your system by
running this command in the <TT>`sql'</TT> directory of your MySQL
source tree:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; make udf_example.o
</PRE>

<P>
You should run a compile command similar to the one that <CODE>make</CODE> displays,
except that you should remove the <CODE>-c</CODE> option near the end of the line
and add <CODE>-o udf_example.so</CODE> to the end of the line.  (On some systems,
you may need to leave  the <CODE>-c</CODE> on the command.)

</P>
<P>
Once you compile a shared object containing UDFs, you must install it
and tell MySQL about it.  Compiling a shared object from
<TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT> produces a file named something like
<TT>`udf_example.so'</TT> (the exact name may vary from platform to platform).
Copy this file to some directory searched by <CODE>ld</CODE>, such as
<TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.  On many systems, you can set the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY</CODE> or
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable to point at the directory where
you have your UDF function files. The <CODE>dlopen</CODE> manual page tells you
which variable you should use on your system. You should set this in
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> or <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After the library is installed, notify <CODE>mysqld</CODE> about the new
functions with these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";
mysql&#62; CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_double RETURNS REAL SONAME "udf_example.so";
mysql&#62; CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_int RETURNS INTEGER SONAME "udf_example.so";
mysql&#62; CREATE FUNCTION lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";
mysql&#62; CREATE FUNCTION reverse_lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";
</PRE>

<P>
Functions can be deleted using <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DROP FUNCTION metaphon;
mysql&#62; DROP FUNCTION myfunc_double;
mysql&#62; DROP FUNCTION myfunc_int;
mysql&#62; DROP FUNCTION lookup;
mysql&#62; DROP FUNCTION reverse_lookup;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> statements update the
system table <CODE>func</CODE> in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  The function's name,
type and shared library name are saved in the table.  You must have the
<STRONG>insert</STRONG> and <STRONG>delete</STRONG> privileges for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
You should not use <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> to add a function that has already
been created.  If you need to reinstall a function, you should remove it with
<CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> and then reinstall it with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>.  You
would need to do this, for example, if you recompile a new version of your
function, so that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets the new version.  Otherwise the server
will continue to use the old version.

</P>
<P>
Active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless you start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In this case, UDF
initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An active function is
one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and not removed with

</P>
<P>
The procedure for adding a new native function is described below.  Note
that you cannot add native functions to a binary distribution because
the procedure involves modifying MySQL source code.  You must
compile MySQL yourself from a source distribution.  Also note
that if you migrate to another version of MySQL (for example,
when a new version is released), you will need to repeat the procedure
with the new version.

</P>
<P>
To add a new native MySQL function, follow these steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add one line to <TT>`lex.h'</TT> that defines the function name in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array.
<LI>

If the function prototype is simple (just takes zero, one, two or three
arguments), you should in lex.h specify SYM(FUNC_ARG#) (where # is the
number of arguments) as the second argument in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array and add a function that creates a function
object in <TT>`item_create.cc'</TT>.  Take a look at <CODE>"ABS"</CODE> and
<CODE>create_funcs_abs()</CODE> for an example of this.

If the function prototype is complicated (for example takes a variable number
of arguments), you should add two lines to <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>. One
indicates the preprocessor symbol that <CODE>yacc</CODE> should define (this
should be added at the beginning of the file). Then define the function
parameters and add an ``item'' with these parameters to the
<CODE>simple_expr</CODE> parsing rule.  For an example, check all occurrences
of <CODE>ATAN</CODE> in <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to see how this is done.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.h'</TT>, declare a class inheriting from <CODE>Item_num_func</CODE> or
<CODE>Item_str_func</CODE>, depending on whether your function returns a number or a
string.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.cc'</TT>, add one of the following declarations, depending
on whether you are defining a numeric or string function:

<PRE>
double   Item_func_newname::val()
longlong Item_func_newname::val_int()
String  *Item_func_newname::Str(String *str)
</PRE>

If you inherit your object from any of the standard items (like
<CODE>Item_num_func</CODE> you probably only have to define one of the above
functions and let the parent object take care of the other functions.
For example, the <CODE>Item_str_func</CODE> class defines a <CODE>val()</CODE> function
that executes <CODE>atof()</CODE> on the value returned by <CODE>::str()</CODE>.

<LI>

You should probably also define the following object function:

<PRE>
void Item_func_newname::fix_length_and_dec()
</PRE>

This function should at least calculate <CODE>max_length</CODE> based on the
given arguments. <CODE>max_length</CODE> is the maximum number of characters
the function may return.  This function should also set <CODE>maybe_null
= 0</CODE> if the main function can't return a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  The
function can check if any of the function arguments can return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> by checking the arguments <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> variable. You
can take a look at <CODE>Item_func_mod::fix_length_and_dec</CODE> for a
typical example of how to do this.
</OL>

<P>
All functions must be thread safe (In other words, don't use any global or
static variables in the functions without protecting them with mutexes).

</P>
<P>
If you want to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>, from <CODE>::val()</CODE>, <CODE>::val_int()</CODE>
or <CODE>::str()</CODE> you should set <CODE>null_value</CODE> to 1 and return 0.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>::str()</CODE> object functions, there are some additional
considerations to be aware of:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>String *str</CODE> argument provides a string buffer that may be
used to hold the result. (For more information about the <CODE>String</CODE> type,
take a look at the <TT>`sql_string.h'</TT> file.)
<LI>

The <CODE>::str()</CODE> function should return the string that holds the result or
<CODE>(char*) 0</CODE> if the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

All current string functions try to avoid allocating any memory unless
absolutely necessary!

The TCP/IP connection thread handles all connection requests and
creates a new dedicated thread to handle the authentication and

<LI>

On Windows NT there is a named pipe handler thread that does the same work as
the TCP/IP connection thread on named pipe connect requests.

<LI>

The signal thread handles all signals.  This thread also normally handles
alarms and calls <CODE>process_alarm()</CODE> to force timeouts on connections
that have been idle too long.

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is compiled with <CODE>-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD</CODE>, a dedicated 
thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some systems where
there are problems with <CODE>sigwait()</CODE> or if one wants to use the
<CODE>thr_alarm()</CODE> code in ones application without a dedicated signal
handling thread.

<LI>

If one uses the <CODE>--flush_time=#</CODE> option, a dedicated thread is created
to flush all tables at the given interval.

<LI>

Every connection has its own thread.

<LI>

Every different table on which one uses <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> gets its

Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on proprietary 
customer data and for that reason has not been publicly available. The only 
publicly available part of our testing process consisted of the <CODE>crash-me</CODE>
test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the <CODE>sql-bench</CODE> directory, and 
miscellaneous tests located in <CODE>tests</CODE> directory. The lack of a 
standardized publicly available test suite has made it difficult for our users,
as well developers, to do regression tests on the MySQL code. To 
address this problem, we have created a new test system that is included in
the source and binary distributions starting in Version 3.23.29.

</P>
<P>
The current set of test cases doesn't test everything in MySQL, but it
should catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library
issues, and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal
is to have the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions
to our test suite.  You may especially want to contribute tests that
examine the functionality critical to your system, as this will ensure
that all future MySQL releases will work well with your
applications.

<H4><A NAME="running_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#running_mysqltest">9.3.2.1  Running the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
The test system consist of a test language interpreter
(<CODE>mysqltest</CODE>), a shell script to run all
tests(<CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>), the actual test cases written in a special
test language, and their expected results.  To run the test suite on
your system after a build, type <CODE>make test</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run</CODE> from the source root.  If you have
installed a binary distribution, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the install root
(eg. <CODE>/usr/local/mysql</CODE>), and do <CODE>scripts/mysql-test-run</CODE>.
All tests should succeed.  If not, you should try to find out why and
report the problem if this is a bug in MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">9.3.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a copy of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using
ports <CODE>9306</CODE> and <CODE>9307</CODE>.  If one of those ports is taken, you should
edit <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> and change the values of the master and/or slave
port to one that is available.

</P>
<P>
You can run one individual test case with
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run test_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If one test fails, you should test running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with
the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to check if any other tests fails.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="extending_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#extending_mysqltest">9.3.2.2  Extending the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>mysqltest</CODE> language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it - we plan to
do this shortly.  You can, however, look at our current test cases and use 
them as an example.  The following points should help you get started:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The tests are located in <CODE>mysql-test/t/*.test</CODE>

<LI>

A test case consists of <CODE>;</CODE> terminated statements and is similar to the
input of <CODE>mysql</CODE> command line client.  A statement by default is a query
to be sent to MySQL server, unless it is recognized as internal
command ( eg. <CODE>sleep</CODE> ).

<LI>

All queries that produce results, e.g. <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>,
<CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, etc., must be preceded with <CODE>@/path/to/result/file</CODE>.  The
file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to generate the result 
file is to run <CODE>mysqltest -r &#60; t/test-case-name.test</CODE> from 
<CODE>mysql-test</CODE> directory, and then edit the generated result files, if 
needed, to adjust them to the expected output.  In that case, be very careful 
about not adding or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only 
change the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make sure
the fields are separated with a hard tab, and there is a hard tab at the end.  
You may want to use <CODE>od -c</CODE> to make sure your text editor has not messed 
anything up during edit.  We, of course, hope that you will never have to edit
the output of <CODE>mysqltest -r</CODE> as you only have to do it when you find a 
bug.

<LI>

To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files in
<CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory and name them <CODE>test_name.result</CODE>.  If the
test produces more than one result, you should use <CODE>test_name.a.result</CODE>,
<CODE>test_name.b.result</CODE>, etc.

<LI>

If a statement returns an error, you should on the line before the statement
specify with the <CODE>--error error-number</CODE>.  The error number can be
a list of possible error numbers separated with <CODE>','</CODE>.

<LI>

If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the first line of
the test file, put <CODE>source include/master-slave.inc;</CODE>.  To switch between
master and slave, use <CODE>connection master;</CODE> and <CODE>connection slave;</CODE>. 
If you need to do something on an alternate connection, you can do 
<CODE>connection master1;</CODE> for the master, and <CODE>connection slave1;</CODE> for
the slave.

<LI>

If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like this:

<PRE>
let $1=1000;
while ($1)
{
 # do your queries here
 dec $1;
}
</PRE>

<LI>

To sleep between queries, use the <CODE>sleep</CODE> command. It supports fractions
of a second, so you can do <CODE>sleep 1.3;</CODE>, for example, to sleep 1.3 
seconds.

<LI>

To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put them
in the command-line format in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt</CODE>. For
the master, put them in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt</CODE>.

<LI>

If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case to contribute,
e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>. As the list does not accept 
attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files to:

<H4><A NAME="Reporting_mysqltest_bugs" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">9.3.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
If your MySQL version doesn't pass the test suite you should
do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as possible of
what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script
so that we can get information about your system and <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
version. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.
<LI>

Make sure to include the output of <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>, as well as
contents of all <CODE>.reject</CODE> files in <CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory.
<LI>

If a test in the test suite fails, check if the test fails also when run
by its own:


<PRE>
cd mysql-test
mysql-test-run --local test-name
</PRE>

If this fails, then you should configure MySQL with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> and run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the
<CODE>--debug</CODE> option. If this also fails send the trace file
<TT>`var/tmp/master.trace'</TT> to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret
so that we can examine it. Please remember to also include a full
description of your system, the version of the mysqld binary and how you
compiled it.

<LI>

Try also to run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to
see if there is any other test that fails.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL yourself, check our manual for how
to compile MySQL on your platform or, preferable, use one of
the binaries we have compiled for you at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.  All our standard binaries should
pass the test suite !

<LI>

If you get an error, like <CODE>Result length mismatch</CODE> or <CODE>Result
content mismatch</CODE> it means that the output of the test didn't match
exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in MySQL or
that your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
circumstances.

Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as the
result file with the <CODE>.reject</CODE> extension.  If your test case is
failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see how
they are different, examine both with <CODE>od -c</CODE> and also check their
lengths.

<LI>

If a test fails totally, you should check the logs file in the
<CODE>mysql-test/var/log</CODE> directory for hints of what went wrong.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL with debugging you can try to debug this
by running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--gdb</CODE> and/or <CODE>--debug</CODE>
options.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

If you have not compiled MySQL for debugging you should probably
do that.  Just specify the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1641"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1642"></A>

</P>

<P>
This chapter lists some common problems and error messages that users have
run into.  You will learn how to figure out what the problem is, and what
to do to solve it.  You will also find proper solutions to some common
problems.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="What_is_crashing" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A></H2>

<P>
When you run into problems, the first thing you should do is to find out
which program / piece of equipment is causing problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you have one of the following symptoms, then it is probably a hardware
(like memory, motherboard, CPU, or hard disk) or kernel problem:

<UL>
<LI>

The keyboard doesn't work.  This can normally be checked by pressing
Caps Lock. If the Caps Lock light doesn't change you have to replace
your keyboard.  (Before doing this, you should try to reboot
your computer and check all cables to the keyboard.)
<LI>

The mouse pointer doesn't move.
<LI>

The machine doesn't answer to a remote machine's pings.
<LI>

Different, unrelated programs don't behave correctly.
<LI>

If your system rebooted unexpectedly (a faulty user level program should
NEVER be able to take down your system).
</UL>

In this case you should start by checking all your cables and run some
diagnostic tool to check your hardware!
You should also check if there are any patches, updates, or service
packs for your operating system that could likely solve your problems.
Check also that all your libraries (like glibc) are up to date.

It's always good to use a machine with ECC memory to discover
memory problems early!
<LI>

If your keyboard is locked up, you may be able to fix this by
logging into your machine from another machine and execute
<CODE>kbd_mode -a</CODE> on it.

<LI>

Please examine your system log file (/var/log/messages or similar) for
reasons for your problems.  If you think the problem is in MySQL
then you should also examine MySQL's log files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>.

<LI>

If you don't think you have hardware problems, you should try to find
out which program is causing problems.

Try using <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>ps</CODE>, <CODE>taskmanager</CODE>, or some similar program,
to check which program is taking all CPU or is locking the machine.

<LI>

Check with <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>df</CODE>, or a similar program if you are out of
memory, disk space, open files, or some other critical resource.

<LI>

If the problem is some runaway process, you can always try to kill it. If it
doesn't want to die, there is probably a bug in the operating system.
</UL>

<P>
If after you have examined all other possibilities and you have
concluded that it's the MySQL server or a MySQL client
that is causing the problem, it's time to do a bug report for our
mailing list or our support team.  In the bug report, try to give a
very detailed description of how the system is behaving and what you think is
happening. You should also state why you think it's MySQL that
is causing the problems.  Take into consideration all the situations in
this chapter. State any problems exactly how they appear when you
examine your system. Use the 'cut and paste' method for any output
and/or error messages from programs and/or log files!

</P>
<P>
Try to describe in detail which program is not working and all
symptoms you see!  We have in the past received many bug reports that just
state "the system doesn't work".  This doesn't provide us with any
information about what could be the problem.

</P>
<P>
If a program fails, it's always useful to know:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Has the program in question made a segmentation fault (core dumped)?
<LI>

Is the program taking the whole CPU? Check with <CODE>top</CODE>. Let the
program run for a while, it may be evaluating something heavy.
<LI>

If it's the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server that is causing problems, can you
do <CODE>mysqladmin -u root ping</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE>?
<LI>

What does a client program say (try with <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for example)
when you try to connect to the MySQL server?
Does the client jam?  Do you get any output from the program?
</UL>

<P>
When sending a bug report, you should of follow the outlines
described in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Asking_questions">1.2.22.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Gone_away" HREF="manual_toc.html#Gone_away">A.2.2  <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
This section also covers the related <CODE>Lost connection to server
during query</CODE> error.

</P>
<P>
The most common reason for the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is that the server timed out and closed the connection. By default, the
server closes the connection after 8 hours if nothing has happened. You
can change the time limit by setting the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> variable when
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another common reason to receive the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is because you have issued a ``close'' on your MySQL connection
and then tried to run a query on the closed connection.

</P>
<P>
You can check that the MySQL hasn't died by executing
<CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE> and examining the uptime.

</P>
<P>
If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again for the client
to do an automatic reconnection.

</P>
<P>
You normally can get the following error codes in this case
(which one you get is OS-dependent):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR</CODE> </TD><TD> The client couldn't send a question to the
server.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_LOST</CODE> </TD><TD> The client didn't get an error when writing
to the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or any answer) to the question.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You can also get these errors if you send a query to the server that is
incorrect or too large. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets a packet that is too large
or out of order, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and
closes the connection.  If you need big queries (for example, if you are
working with big <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), you can increase the query limit by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>-O max_allowed_packet=#</CODE> option
(default 1M). The extra memory is allocated on demand, so <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
use more memory only when you issue a big query or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> must
return a big result row!

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Can_not_connect_to_server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Can_not_connect_to_server">A.2.3  <CODE>Can't connect to [local] MySQL server</CODE> error</A></H3>

<P>
A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in two
different ways: Unix sockets, which connect through a file in the file
system (default <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>) or TCP/IP, which connects
through a port number.  Unix sockets are faster than TCP/IP but can only
be used when connecting to a server on the same computer.  Unix sockets
are used if you don't specify a hostname or if you specify the special
hostname <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Windows you can connect only with TCP/IP if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
is running on Win95/Win98. If mysqld is running on NT and started with
<CODE>enable-named-pipe</CODE>, you can also connect with named pipes.  The
name of the named pipe is MySQL.  If you don't give a hostname when
connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, a MySQL client will first try to connect to
the named pipe, and if this doesn't work it will connect to the TCP/IP
port.  You can force the use of named pipes on Windows by using <CODE>.</CODE> 
as the hostname.

</P>
<P>
The error (2002) <CODE>Can't connect to ...</CODE> normally means that there
isn't a MySQL server running on the system or that you are
using a wrong socket file or TCP/IP port when trying to connect to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
Start by checking (using <CODE>ps</CODE> or the task manager on Windows) that
there is a process running named <CODE>mysqld</CODE> on your server!  If there
isn't any <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process, you should start one. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is running, you can check the server by
trying these different connections (the port number and socket pathname
might be different in your setup, of course):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'ip for your host' version
shell&#62; mysqladmin --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the <CODE>hostname</CODE>
command; these cause the output of <CODE>hostname</CODE> (that is, the current
hostname) to be substituted into the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
Here are some reasons the <CODE>Can't connect to local MySQL server</CODE>
error might occur:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running.
<LI>

You are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads.
If you are running on a system that doesn't have native threads,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses the MIT-pthreads package.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.2  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.  However,
all MIT-pthreads versions doesn't support Unix sockets. On a system
without sockets support you must always specify the hostname explicitly
when connecting to the server. Try using this command to check the
connection to the server:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version
</PRE>

<LI>

Someone has removed the Unix socket that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses (default
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>).  You might have a <CODE>cron</CODE> job that removes
the MySQL socket (for example, a job that removes old files
from the <TT>`/tmp'</TT> directory).  You can always run <CODE>mysqladmin
version</CODE> and check that the socket <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> is trying to use
really exists.  The fix in this case is to change the <CODE>cron</CODE> job to
not remove <TT>`mysqld.sock'</TT> or to place the socket somewhere else.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or change the MySQL socket file <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You have started the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with
the <CODE>--socket=/path/to/socket</CODE> option.  If you change the socket
pathname for the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients
about the new path. You can do this by providing the socket path
as an argument to the client. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or change the MySQL socket file <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You are using Linux and one thread has died (core dumped).  In this case
you must kill the other <CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads (for example, with the
<CODE>mysql_zap</CODE> script before you can start a new MySQL
server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.
<LI>

You may not have read and write privilege to either the directory that holds
the socket file or privilege to the socket file itself. In this case you
have to either change the privilege for the directory / file or restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> so that it uses a directory that you can access.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the error message <CODE>Can't connect to MySQL server on
some_hostname</CODE>, you can try the following things to find out what the
problem is :

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Check if the server is up by doing <CODE>telnet your-host-name
tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press <CODE>RETURN</CODE> a couple of times.  If there
is a MySQL server running on this port you should get a
responses that includes the version number of the running MySQL
server.  If you get an error like <CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to
remote host: Connection refused</CODE>, then there is no server running on the
given port.
<LI>

Try connecting to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon on the local machine and check
the TCP/IP port that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> it's configured to use (variable <CODE>port</CODE>) with
<CODE>mysqladmin variables</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not started with the
<CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Blocked_host" HREF="manual_toc.html#Blocked_host">A.2.4  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you get an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Host 'hostname' is blocked because of many connection errors.
Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'
</PRE>

<P>
this means that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has gotten a lot (<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE>)
of connect requests from the host <CODE>'hostname'</CODE> that have been interrupted
in the middle. After <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> failed requests, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
assumes that something is wrong (like an attack from a cracker), and
blocks the site from further connections until someone executes the command
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-hosts</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> blocks a host after 10 connection errors.
You can easily adjust this by starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O max_connect_errors=10000 &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you get this error message for a given host, you should first
check that there isn't anything wrong with TCP/IP connections from that
host.  If your TCP/IP connections aren't working, it won't do you any good to
increase the value of the <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> variable!

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Too_many_connections" HREF="manual_toc.html#Too_many_connections">A.2.5  <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you get the error <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> when you try to connect
to MySQL, this means that there is already <CODE>max_connections</CODE>
clients connected to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
If you need more connections than the default (100), then you should restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a bigger value for the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> actually allows (<CODE>max_connections</CODE>+1)
clients to connect.  The last connection is reserved for a user with the
<STRONG>process</STRONG> privilege.  By not giving this privilege to normal
users (they shouldn't need this), an administrator with this privilege
can log in and use <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> to find out what could be
wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.5  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of connects MySQL is depending on how good
the thread library is on a given platform. Linux or Solaris should be
able to support 500-1000 simultaneous connections, depending on how much
RAM you have and what your clients are doing.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Non-transactional_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Non-transactional_tables">A.2.6  <CODE>Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1647"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you get the error/warning: <CODE>Warning: Some non-transactional
changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> when trying to do a
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, this means that some of the tables you used in the
transaction didn't support transactions.  These non-transactional tables
will not be affected by the <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
The most typical case when this happens is when you have tried to create
a table of a type that is not supported by your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary.
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't support a table type (or if the table type is
disabled by a startup option) , it will instead create the table type
with the table type that is most resembles to the one you requested,
probably <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the table type for a table by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_TABLE_STATUS">4.5.5.2  <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the extensions your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary supports by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>show variables like 'have_%'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.5.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Out_of_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#Out_of_memory">A.2.7  <CODE>Out of memory</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you issue a query and get something like the following error:

</P>

mysql: Out of memory at line 42, 'malloc.c'
mysql: needed 8136 byte (8k), memory in use: 12481367 bytes (12189k)
ERROR 2008: MySQL client ran out of memory
</PRE>

<P>
note that the error refers to the MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE>. The
reason for this error is simply that the client does not have enough memory to
store the whole result.

</P>
<P>
To remedy the problem, first check that your query is correct. Is it
reasonable that it should return so many rows?  If so,
you can use <CODE>mysql --quick</CODE>, which uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to retrieve the result set.  This places less of a load on the client (but
more on the server).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Packet_too_large" HREF="manual_toc.html#Packet_too_large">A.2.8  <CODE>Packet too large</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
When a MySQL client or the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server gets a packet bigger
than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes, it issues a <CODE>Packet too large</CODE>
error and closes the connection.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, you may specify a bigger buffer by
starting the client with <CODE>mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=8M</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using other clients that do not allow you to specify the maximum
packet size (such as <CODE>DBI</CODE>), you need to set the packet size when you
start the server.  You cau use a command-line option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to set
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to a larger size.  For example, if you are
expecting to store the full length of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> into a table, you'll need
to start the server with the <CODE>--set-variable=max_allowed_packet=16M</CODE>
option.

</P>
<P>
You can also get strange problems with large packets if you are using
big blobs, but you haven't given <CODE>mysqld</CODE> access to enough memory
to handle the query.  If you suspect this is the case, try adding
<CODE>ulimit -d 256000</CODE> to the beginning of the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script
and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

Other reasons for problems with Aborted clients / Aborted connections.

<UL>
<LI>

Usage of duplex Ethernet protocol, both half and full with
Linux. Many Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You should test
for this bug by transferring a huge file via ftp between these two
machines. If a transfer goes in burst-pause-burst-pause ... mode then
you are experiencing a Linux duplex syndrome. The only solution to
this problem is switching of both half and full duplexing on hubs
and switches.
<LI>

Some problem with the thread library that causes interrupts on reads.
<LI>

Badly configured TCP/IP.
<LI>

Faulty Ethernets or hubs or switches, cables ... This can be diagnosed
properly only by replacing hardware.
<LI>

<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is too small or queries require more memory

<P>
This error occurs in older MySQL versions when an in-memory temporary
table becomes larger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> bytes. To avoid this
problem, you can use the <CODE>-O tmp_table_size=#</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to increase the temporary table size or use the SQL

query. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option.
This is exactly the same as using <CODE>SQL_BIG_TABLES</CODE> for all queries.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23, in-memory temporary tables will automatically be

<P>
If you get an error for some queries of type:

</P>

<P>
this means that MySQL can't create a temporary file for the

<P>
Possible causes of and fixes for this problem:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You may be running a new version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with an old
<CODE>user</CODE> table.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqlshow mysql user</CODE> to see if
the password field is shorter than 16 characters. If so, you can correct this
condition by running the <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> script.

<LI>

The user has an old password (8 characters long) and you didn't start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option.
Update the user in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a new password or
restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1654"></A>
You have specified a password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table without using the
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function.  Use <CODE>mysql</CODE> to update the user in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table with a new password. Make sure to use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>
function:

<P>
If you get the error <CODE>Table 'xxx' doesn't exist</CODE> or <CODE>Can't

</P>
<P>
Note that as MySQL uses directories and files to store databases and
tables, the database and table names are <STRONG>case sensitive</STRONG>!
(On Windows the databases and tables names are not case sensitive, but all
references to a given table within a query must use the same case!)

</P>

You can check which tables you have in the current database with

<P>
If you get an error like:

</P>

MySQL Connection Failed: Can't initialize character set xxx
</PRE>

<P>
This means one of the following things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The character set is a multi-byte character set and you have not support
for the character set in the client.

In this case you need to recompile the client with
<CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE> or with <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=xxx</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-character-sets=complex</CODE> which will enable support for
all multi-byte character sets. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

The character set is a simple character set which is not compiled into
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and the character set definition files is not in the place
where the client expect to find them.

In this case you need to:


<UL>
<LI>

Recompile the client with support for the character set.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.
<LI>

Specify to the client where the character set definition files are. For many
client you can do this with the
<CODE>--character-sets-dir=path-to-charset-dir</CODE> option.
<LI>

Copy the character definition files to the path where the client expect them
to be.

file: ... (errno: 24)</CODE>, or any other error with <CODE>errno 23</CODE> or
<CODE>errno 24</CODE> from MySQL, it means that you haven't allocated
enough file descriptors for MySQL.  You can use the
<CODE>perror</CODE> utility to get a description of what the error number
means:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perror 23
File table overflow
shell&#62; perror 24
Too many open files
shell&#62; perror 11
Resource temporarily unavailable
</PRE>

<P>
The problem here is that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to keep open too many
files simultaneously.  You can either tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to open so
many files at once or increase the number of file descriptors
available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to keep open fewer files at a time, you can make
the table cache smaller by using the <CODE>-O table_cache=32</CODE> option to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> (the default value is 64). Reducing the value of
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> will also reduce the number of open files (the
default value is 90).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1656"></A>
To change the number of file descriptors available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you
can use the option <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or
<CODE>-O open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.5.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
The easiest way to do that is to add the option to your option file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  my.cnf Option Files</A>.  If you have an old <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version that
doesn't support this, you can edit the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script.  There
is a commented-out line <CODE>ulimit -n 256</CODE> in the script.  You can
remove the <CODE>'#'</CODE> character to uncomment this line, and change the
number 256 to affect the number of file descriptors available to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ulimit</CODE> (and <CODE>open-files-limit</CODE>) can increase the number of
file descriptors, but only up to the limit imposed by the operating
system. There is also a 'hard' limit that can only be overrided if you
start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root (Just remember that
you need to also use the <CODE>--user=..</CODE> option in this case).  If you
need to increase the OS limit on the number of file descriptors
available to each process, consult the documentation for your operating
system.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you run the <CODE>tcsh</CODE> shell, <CODE>ulimit</CODE> will not work!
<CODE>tcsh</CODE> will also report incorrect values when you ask for the current
limits!  In this case you should start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>sh</CODE>!

it usually means that your library is compiled on a system that is not

If you are trying to run a program and you then get errors for

</P>
<P>
The fix for this is to tell your system to search after shared
libraries where the library is located by one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Add the path to the directory where you have <CODE>libmysqlclient.so</CODE> the
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable.
<LI>

Add the path to the directory where you have <CODE>libmysqlclient.so</CODE> the

<LI>

Copy <CODE>libmysqlclient.so</CODE> to some place that is searched by your system,
like <TT>`/lib'</TT>, and update the shared library information by executing
<CODE>ldconfig</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Another way to solve this problem is to link your program statically, with
<CODE>-static</CODE>, or by removing the dynamic MySQL libraries
before linking your code. In the second case you should be
sure that no other programs are using the dynamic libraries!

The MySQL server <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be started and run by any user.
In order to change <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as a Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, you must
do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Stop the server if it's running (use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).

<LI>

Change the database directories and files so that <CODE>user_name</CODE> has
privileges to read and write files in them (you may need to do this as
the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user):


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir
</PRE>

If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are
symlinks, you'll also need to follow those links and change the directories
and files they point to.  <CODE>chown -R</CODE> may not follow symlinks for
you.

<LI>

Start the server as user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, or, if you are using
MySQL Version 3.22 or later, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE>
user and use the <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE> option.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will switch
to run as the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE> before accepting any connections.

<LI>

To start the server as the given user name automatically at system
startup time, add a <CODE>user</CODE> line that specifies the user name to
the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
user=user_name
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
At this point, your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process should be running fine and dandy as
the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>. One thing hasn't changed, though: the
contents of the permissions tables. By default (right after running the
permissions table install script <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>), the MySQL
user <CODE>root</CODE> is the only user with permission to access the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database or to create or drop databases.  Unless you have changed those
permissions, they still hold. This shouldn't stop you from accessing
MySQL as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user when you're logged in
as a Unix user other than <CODE>root</CODE>; just specify the <CODE>-u root</CODE> option
to the client program.

</P>
<P>
Note that accessing MySQL as <CODE>root</CODE>, by supplying <CODE>-u
root</CODE> on the command line, has <EM>nothing</EM> to do with MySQL running
as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user, or, indeed, as another Unix user. The access
permissions and user names of MySQL are completely separate from
Unix user names. The only connection with Unix user names is that if you
don't provide a <CODE>-u</CODE> option when you invoke a client program, the client
will try to connect using your Unix login name as your MySQL user
name.

</P>
<P>
If your Unix box itself isn't secured, you should probably at least put a
password on the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> users in the access tables.
Otherwise, any user with an account on that machine can run <CODE>mysql -u
root db_name</CODE> and do whatever he likes.

<A NAME="IDX1666"></A>
then the environment variable <CODE>UMASK</CODE> might be set incorrectly when
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up.  The default umask value is <CODE>0660</CODE>. You can
change this behavior by starting <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK=384  # = 600 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1667"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1668"></A>
By default MySQL will create database and <CODE>RAID</CODE>
directories with permission type 0700.  You can modify this behavior by
setting the <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> variable. If you set this, new
directories are created with the combined <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and
<CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE>. For example, if you want to give group access to
all new directories, you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK_DIR=504  # = 770 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK_DIR
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.25 and above, MySQL assumes that the
value for <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> is in octal if it starts
with a zero.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL versions are tested on many platforms before they are
released.  This doesn't mean that there aren't any bugs in
MySQL, but it means if there are bugs, they are very few and can be
hard to find.  If you have a problem, it will always help if you try to
find out exactly what crashes your system, as you will have a much better
chance of getting this fixed quickly.

</P>
<P>
First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon dies or whether your problem has to do with your
client.  You can check how long your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server has been up by
executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has died, you may
find the reason for this in the file
<TT>`mysql-data-directory/`hostname`.err'</TT>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
Many crashes of MySQL are caused by corrupted index / data
files.  MySQL will update the data on disk, with the
<CODE>write()</CODE> system call, after every SQL statement and before the
client is notified about the result. (This is not true if you are running
with <CODE>delayed_key_writes</CODE>, in which case only the data is written.)
This means that the data is safe even if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes, as the OS will
ensure that the not flushed data is written to disk.  You can force
MySQL to sync everything to disk after every SQL command by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--flush</CODE>.

The above means that normally you shouldn't get corrupted tables unless:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Someone/something killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or the machine in the middle
of an update.
<LI>

You have found a bug in <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that caused it to die in the
middle of an update.
<LI>

Someone is manipulating the data/index files outside of <STRONG>mysqld</STRONG>
without locking the table properly.
<LI>

If you are running many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same data on a
system that doesn't support good file system locks (normally handled by
the <CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon ) or if you are running
multiple servers with <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>
<LI>

You have a crashed index/data file that contains very wrong data that
got <CODE>mysqld</CODE> confused.
<LI>

You have found a bug in the data storage code. This isn't that likely,
but it's at least possible.  In this case you can try to change the file
type to another database handler by using <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a
repaired copy of the table!
</UL>

<P>
Because it is very difficult to know why something is crashing, first try to
check whether or not things that work for others crash for you.  Please try
the following things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>, run
<CODE>myisamchk --silent --force */*.MYI</CODE> on all tables, and restart the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon.  This will ensure that you are running from a clean
state.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  MySQL Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqld --log</CODE> and try to determine from the information in the log
whether or not some specific query kills the server. About 95% of all bugs are
related to a particular query!  Normally this is one of the last queries in
the log file just before MySQL restarted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.
If you can repeatadly kill MySQL with one of the queries, even
when you have checked all tables just before doing the query, then you
have been able to locate the bug and should do a bug report for this!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<LI>

Try to make a test case that we can use to reproduce the problem.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">G.1.6  Making a test case when you experience table corruption</A>.

<LI>

Try running the included mysql-test test and the MySQL
benchmarks.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">9.3.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.  They should test MySQL
rather well.  You can also add code that to the benchmarks to simulates
your application!  The benchmarks can be found in the <TT>`bench'</TT>
directory in the source distribution or, for a binary distribution, in
the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

Try <CODE>fork_test.pl</CODE> and <CODE>fork2_test.pl</CODE>.

<LI>

If you configure MySQL for debugging, it will be much easier to
gather information about possible errors if something goes wrong.
Reconfigure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option or
<CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> to <CODE>configure</CODE> and then recompile.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">G.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

Configuring MySQL for debugging causes a safe memory allocator to be
included that can find some errors. It also provides a lot of output about
what is happening.

<LI>

Have you applied the latest patches for your operating system?

<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  On some systems, the
<CODE>lockd</CODE> lock manager does not work properly; the <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE>
option tells <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to use external locking.  (This means that you
cannot run 2 <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same data and that you must be
careful if you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but it may be instructive to try the
option as a test.)

<LI>

Have you tried <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
appears to be running but not responding?  Sometimes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not
comatose even though you might think so.  The problem may be that all
connections are in use, or there may be some internal lock problem.
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> will usually be able to make a connection even
in these cases, and can provide useful information about the current number
of connections and their status.

<LI>

Run the command <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5 status</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5
-r status</CODE> or in a separate window to produce statistics while you run
your other queries.

<LI>

Try the following:

<OL>
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from <CODE>gdb</CODE> (or in another debugger).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">G.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

<LI>

Run your test scripts.

<LI>

Print the backtrace and the local variables at the 3 lowest levels. In gdb you
can do this with the following commands when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has crashed inside
gdb:


<PRE>
backtrace
info local
up
info local
up
info local
</PRE>

With gdb you can also examine which threads exist with <CODE>info
threads</CODE> and switch to a specific thread with <CODE>thread #</CODE>, where
<CODE>#</CODE> is the thread id.
</OL>

<LI>

Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to force
MySQL to crash or misbehave.

<LI>

Send a normal bug report. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>. Be even more detailed
than usual.  Because MySQL works for many people, it may be that the
crash results from something that exists only on your computer (for example,
an error that is related to your particular system libraries).
<LI>

If you have a problem with tables with dynamic-length rows and you are
not using <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE> columns (but only <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns), you
can try to change all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>.  This will force MySQL to use fixed-size rows.
Fixed-size rows take a little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
corruption!

The current dynamic row code has been in use at MySQL AB for at
least 3 years without any problems, but by nature dynamic-length rows are
more prone to errors, so it may be a good idea to try the above to see if
it helps!

</OL>

<P>
Note that after you started <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>,

</P>
<P>
When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

It checks once every minute to see whether or not there is enough space to
write the current row. If there is enough space, it continues as if nothing had
happened.
<LI>

Every 6 minutes it writes an entry to the log file warning about the disk
full condition.
</UL>

<P>
To alleviate the problem, you can take the following actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to insert all records.
<LI>

To abort the thread, you must send a <CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> to the thread.
The thread will be aborted the next time it checks the disk (in 1 minute).
<LI>

Note that other threads may be waiting for the table that caused the disk
full condition.  If you have several ``locked'' threads, killing the one
thread that is waiting on the disk-full condition will allow the other
threads to continue.
</UL>

<P>
Exceptions to the above behaveour is when you use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or
<CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> or when the indexes are created in a batch after an
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> or after an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
All of the above commands may use big temporary files that left to
themself would cause big problems for the rest of the system.  If
MySQL gets disk full while doing any of the above operations,
it will remove the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed
(except for <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, in which the old table will be left
unchanged).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Temporary_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL uses the value of the <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> environment variable as
the pathname of the directory in which to store temporary files.  If you don't
have <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> set, MySQL uses the system default, which is
normally <TT>`/tmp'</TT> or <TT>`/usr/tmp'</TT>.  If the file system containing your
temporary file directory is too small, you should edit <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to
set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point to a directory in a file system where you have
enough space!  You can also set the temporary directory using the
<CODE>--tmpdir</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL creates all temporary files as hidden files. This ensures
that the temporary files will be removed if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is terminated.  The
disadvantage of using hidden files is that you will not see a big temporary
file that fills up the file system in which the temporary file directory is
located.

</P>
<P>
When sorting (<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>), MySQL normally
uses one or two temporary files. The maximum disk-space needed is:

</P>

<PRE>
(length of what is sorted + sizeof(database pointer))
* number of matched rows
* 2
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sizeof(database pointer)</CODE> is usually 4, but may grow in the future for
really big tables.

</P>
<P>
For some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, MySQL also creates temporary SQL
tables. These are not hidden and have names of the form <TT>`SQL_*'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> creates a temporary table in the same directory as
the original table.

<A NAME="IDX1685"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL searches are case-insensitive (although there are
some character sets that are never case insensitive, such as <CODE>czech</CODE>).
That means that if you search with <CODE>col_name LIKE 'a%'</CODE>, you will get all
column values that start with <CODE>A</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>. If you want to make this
search case-sensitive, use something like <CODE>INSTR(col_name, "A")=1</CODE> to
check a prefix. Or use <CODE>STRCMP(col_name, "A") = 0</CODE> if the column value
must be exactly <CODE>"A"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Simple comparison operations (<CODE>&#62;=, &#62;, = , &#60; , &#60;=</CODE>, sorting and
grouping) are based on each character's ``sort value''. Characters with
the same sort value (like E, e and ) are treated as the same character!

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons where done on
the uppercase value of each character (E == e but E &#60;&#62; ).  In newer
MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> works just like the other comparison
operators.

</P>
<P>
If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion,
declare it as <CODE>BINARY</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using Chinese data in the so-called big5 encoding, you want to
make all character columns <CODE>BINARY</CODE>. This works because the sorting
order of big5 encoding characters is based on the order of ASCII codes.

The format of a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value is <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE>. According to ANSI
SQL, no other format is allowed. You should use this format in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
expressions and in the WHERE clause of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date &#62;= '1997-05-05';
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a number if
the date is used in a numeric context (and vice versa). It is also smart
enough to allow a ``relaxed'' string form when updating and in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause that compares a date to a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or a
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column.  (Relaxed form means that any punctuation character
may be used as the separator between parts. For example, <CODE>'1998-08-15'</CODE>
and <CODE>'1998#08#15'</CODE> are equivalent.) MySQL can also convert a
string containing no separators (such as <CODE>'19980815'</CODE>), provided it
makes sense as a date.

</P>
<P>
The special date <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> can be stored and retrieved as
<CODE>'0000-00-00'.</CODE> When using a <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> date through
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG>, it will automatically be converted to <CODE>NULL</CODE> in
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> Version 2.50.12 and above, because ODBC can't handle this kind of
date.

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL performs the conversions described above, the following
statements work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES (19970505);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997.05.05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');

mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '1997-05-05';
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT mod(idate,100) FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '19970505';
</PRE>

<P>
However, the following will not work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE STRCMP(idate,'19970505')=0;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>STRCMP()</CODE> is a string function, so it converts <CODE>idate</CODE> to
a string and performs a string comparison.  It does not convert
<CODE>'19970505'</CODE> to a date and perform a date comparison.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL does no checking whether or not the date is
correct.  If you store an incorrect date, such as <CODE>'1998-2-31'</CODE>, the
wrong date will be stored. If the date cannot be converted to any reasonable
value, a <CODE>0</CODE> is stored in the <CODE>DATE</CODE> field.  This is mainly a speed
issue and we think it is up to the application to check the dates, and not
the server.

The concept of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is a common source of confusion for
newcomers to SQL, who often think that <CODE>NULL</CODE> is the same thing as an
empty string <CODE>''</CODE>.  This is not the case! For example, the following
statements are completely different:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ("");
</PRE>

<P>
Both statements insert a value into the <CODE>phone</CODE> column, but the first
inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value and the second inserts an empty string.  The
meaning of the first can be regarded as ``phone number is not known'' and the
meaning of the second can be regarded as ``she has no phone''.

</P>
<P>
In SQL, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is always false in comparison to any
other value, even <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE>
always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value unless otherwise indicated in
the documentation for the operators and functions involved in the
expression. All columns in the following example return <CODE>NULL</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT NULL,1+NULL,CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to search for column values that are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, you
cannot use the <CODE>=NULL</CODE> test. The following statement returns no
rows, because <CODE>expr = NULL</CODE> is FALSE, for any expression:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
To look for <CODE>NULL</CODE> values, you must use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> test.
The following shows how to find the <CODE>NULL</CODE> phone number and the
empty phone number:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = "";
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL, as in many other SQL servers, you can't index
columns that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.  You must declare such columns
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>. Conversely, you cannot insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into an indexed
column.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1691"></A>
When reading data with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, empty columns are updated
with <CODE>''</CODE>. If you want a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value in a column, you should use
<CODE>\N</CODE> in the text file. The literal word <CODE>'NULL'</CODE> may also be used
under some circumstances.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.8  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented first. If you
sort in descending order using <CODE>DESC</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented
last.  When using <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, all <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are regarded as
equal.

</P>
<P>
To help with <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling, you can use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and
<CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators and the <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> function.

For some column types, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled specially.  If you
insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column of a table, the
current date and time is inserted.  If you insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the next number in the sequence is inserted.

<A NAME="IDX1696"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can use an alias to refer to a column in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>,
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, or in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> part.  Aliases can also be used
to give columns better names:

SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name GROUP BY id HAVING cnt &#62; 0;
SELECT id AS "Customer identity" FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that ANSI SQL doesn't allow you to refer to an alias in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  This is because when the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> code is
executed the column value may not yet be determined. For example, the
following query is <STRONG>illegal</STRONG>:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name WHERE cnt &#62; 0 GROUP BY id;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement is executed to determine which rows should
be included in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part while <CODE>HAVING</CODE> is used to
decide which rows from the result set should be used.

<CODE>related_column</CODE> is more than 1,048,576 (the default value of
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>, you should split it into smaller parts and
execute multiple <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements.  You will probably get the
fastest <CODE>DELETE</CODE> by only deleting 100-1000 <CODE>related_column</CODE>
id's per query if the <CODE>related_column</CODE> is an index.  If the
<CODE>related_column</CODE> isn't an index, the speed is independent of the
number of arguments in the <CODE>IN</CODE> clause.

<P>
If you have a complicated query that has many tables and that doesn't
return any rows, you should use the following procedure to find out what
is wrong with your query:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Test the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> and check if you can find something that is
obviously wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

Select only those fields that are used in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns some rows.
If the tables are big, it's a good idea to use <CODE>LIMIT 10</CODE> with the query.

<LI>

Do a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> for the column that should have matched a row against
the table that was last removed from the query.

<LI>

If you are comparing <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> columns with numbers that
have decimals, you can't use <CODE>=</CODE>!  This problem is common in most
computer languages because floating-point values are not exact values:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE float_column=3.5;
   -&#62;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE float_column between 3.45 and 3.55;
</PRE>

In most cases, changing the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> will fix this!

<LI>

If you still can't figure out what's wrong, create a minimal test that can
be run with <CODE>mysql test &#60; query.sql</CODE> that shows your problems.
You can create a test file with <CODE>mysqldump --quick database tables &#62; query.sql</CODE>. Open the file in an editor, remove some insert lines (if there are
too many of these), and add your select statement at the end of the file.

Test that you still have your problem by doing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create test2
shell&#62; mysql test2 &#60; query.sql
</PRE>

Post the test file using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> to <a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="ALTER_TABLE_problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#ALTER_TABLE_problems">A.6.1  Problems with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1702"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> changes a table to the current character set.
If you during <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> get a duplicate key error, then the cause
is either that the new character sets maps to keys to the same value
or that the table is corrupted, in which case you should run
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> dies with an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Error on rename of './database/name.frm' to './database/B-a.frm' (Errcode: 17)
</PRE>

<P>
the problem may be that MySQL has crashed in a previous <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> and there is an old table named <TT>`A-something'</TT> or
<TT>`B-something'</TT> lying around.  In this case, go to the MySQL data
directory and delete all files that have names starting with <CODE>A-</CODE> or
<CODE>B-</CODE>.  (You may want to move them elsewhere instead of deleting them.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Create a new table named <TT>`A-xxx'</TT> with the requested changes.

<LI>All rows from the old table are copied to <TT>`A-xxx'</TT>.

<LI>The old table is renamed <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>.

<LI><TT>`A-xxx'</TT> is renamed to your old table name.

<LI><TT>`B-xxx'</TT> is deleted.

</UL>

<P>
If something goes wrong with the renaming operation, MySQL tries to
undo the changes.  If something goes seriously wrong (this shouldn't happen,
of course), MySQL may leave the old table as <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>, but a
simple rename on the system level should get your data back.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Change_column_order" HREF="manual_toc.html#Change_column_order">A.6.2  How To Change the Order of Columns in a Table</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX1705"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1706"></A>

</P>
<P>
The whole point of SQL is to abstract the application from the data
storage format.  You should always specify the order in which you wish to
retrieve your data.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT col_name1, col_name2, col_name3 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
will return columns in the order <CODE>col_name1</CODE>, <CODE>col_name2</CODE>, <CODE>col_name3</CODE>, whereas:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT col_name1, col_name3, col_name2 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
will return columns in the order <CODE>col_name1</CODE>, <CODE>col_name3</CODE>, <CODE>col_name2</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should <STRONG>NEVER</STRONG>, in an application, use <CODE>SELECT *</CODE> and
retrieve the columns based on their position, because the order in which
columns are returned <STRONG>CANNOT</STRONG> be guaranteed over time. A simple
change to your database may cause your application to fail rather
dramatically.

</P>
<P>
If you want to change the order of columns anyway, you can do it as follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Create a new table with the columns in the right order.
<LI>

Execute
<CODE>INSERT INTO new_table SELECT fields-in-new_table-order FROM old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

Drop or rename <CODE>old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME old_table</CODE>.
</OL>



<H3><A NAME="Temporary_table_problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#Temporary_table_problems">A.6.3  TEMPORARY TABLE problems</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
The following are a list of the limitations with <CODE>TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A temporary table can only be of type <CODE>HEAP</CODE>, <CODE>ISAM</CODE> or
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.
<LI>

You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
For example, the following doesn't work.


<PRE>
select * from temporary_table, temporary_table as t2;
</PRE>

We plan to fix the above in 4.0.
<LI>

You can't use <CODE>RENAME</CODE> on a <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table.
Note that <CODE>ALTER TABLE org_name RENAME new_name</CODE> works!

We plan to fix the above in 4.0.

I think you might be interested in my database size.  The whole database
is currently on 15 servers and I think it's about 60.000 of tables
containing about 5.000.000.000 of rows.  My mostly loaded server
currently holds about 10.000 of tables with 1.000.000.000 of rows in it.
Hugest tables have about 50.000.000 of rows, and this value will raise
as soon as I'll move to 2.4 kernel with large files. Currently I have to
delete much of logs for large sites to hold table sizes in 2Gb.

A simple script that can be used to copy fields from one MySQL table

the <CODE>sqlconv.pl</CODE> script. The script will parse through the
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> output and will rearrange the fields so they can be
inserted into a new table. An example is when you want to create a new
table for a different site you are working on, but the table is just a
bit different (that is - fields in different order, etc.).

Contributors to the MySQL distribution are listed here, in

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Paul DuBois
<DD>
Help with making the Reference Manual correct and understandable. That
includes rewriting Monty's and David's attempts at English into English
as other people know it.
<DT>Gianmassimo Vigazzola <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@mbox.vol.it">qwerg@mbox.vol.it</a> or <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@tin.it">qwerg@tin.it</a>

The initial port to Win32/NT.
<DT>Kim Aldale
<DD>
Helped to rewrite Monty's and David's early attempts at English into
English.
<DT>Per Eric Olsson
<DD>
For more or less constructive criticism and real testing of the dynamic
record format.
<DT>Irena Pancirov <a HREF="mailto:irena@mail.yacc.it">irena@mail.yacc.it</a>
<DD>
Win32 port with Borland compiler.  <CODE>mysqlshutdown.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>mysqlwatch.exe</CODE>
<DT>David J. Hughes
<DD>
For the effort to make a shareware SQL database. We at TcX started with
<CODE>mSQL</CODE>, but found that it couldn't satisfy our purposes so instead we
wrote a SQL interface to our application builder Unireg.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
and <CODE>mysql</CODE> are programs that were largely influenced by their
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> counterparts. We have put a lot of effort into making the
MySQL syntax a superset of <CODE>mSQL</CODE>. Many of the API's ideas are
borrowed from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to make it easy to port free <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs
to MySQL. MySQL doesn't contain any code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.
Two files in the distribution (<TT>`client/insert_test.c'</TT> and
<TT>`client/select_test.c'</TT>) are based on the corresponding (non-copyrighted)
files in the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> distribution, but are modified as examples showing
the changes necessary to convert code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to MySQL.
(<CODE>mSQL</CODE> is copyrighted David J. Hughes.)
<DT>Fred Fish
<DD>

of smaller improvements to the library (speed and additional options).
<DT>Richard A. O'Keefe

<H2><A NAME="News-3.23.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.x">F.2  Changes in release 3.23.x  (Stable)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1746"></A>

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release has several major features that are not
present in previous versions.  We have added three new
table types:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>MyISAM</STRONG>
<DD>
A new ISAM library which is tuned for SQL and supports large files.
<DT><STRONG>BerkeleyDB</STRONG> or <STRONG>BDB</STRONG>
<DD>
Uses the Berkeley DB library from Sleepycat Software to implement 
transaction-safe tables.  
<DT><STRONG>InnoDB</STRONG>
<DD>
A transaction-safe table handler that supports row level locking, and many
Oracle-like features.
</DL>

<P>
Note that only MyISAM is available in the standard binary distribution.

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release also includes support for database replication between 
a master and many slaves, full-text indexing, and much more.

</P>
<P>
All new features are being developed in the 4.0 version.  Only
bug fixes and minor enhancements to existing features will be
added to 3.23.

</P>
<P>
The replication code and BerkeleyDB code is still not as tested and as
the rest of the code, so we will probably need to do a couple of future
releases of 3.23 with small fixes for this part of the code. As long as
you don't use these features, you should be quite safe with
MySQL 3.23!

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that replication or Berkeley DB don't
work; We have done a lot of testing of all code, including replication
and BDB without finding any problems.  It only means that not as many
users use this code as the rest of the code and because of this we are
not yet 100% confident in this code.

</P>

Don't give warning for statement that is only a comment;  This is needed for
<CODE>mysqldump --disable-keys</CODE> to work.

Added internal safety checks for InnoDB.
<LI>

Some InnoDB variables was always shown in <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> as
<CODE>OFF</CODE> on high-byte-first systems (like sparc).
<LI>

Fixed problem with one thread using an InnoDB table and another
thread doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the same table. Before that,
mysqld could crash with an assertion failure in row0row.c, line 474.
<LI>

Tuned the InnoDB SQL optimizer to favor more often index searches
over table scans.
<LI>

Fixed a performance problem with InnoDB tables when several large SELECT
queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux computer.  Large
CPU-bound SELECT queries will now also generally run faster on all
platforms.
<LI>

If MySQL binlogging is used, InnoDB now prints after crash recovery the
latest MySQL binlog name and the offset InnoDB was able to recover
to. This is useful, for example, when resynchronizing a master and a
slave database in replication.

One can now recover also MySQL temporary tables which have become
orphaned inside the InnoDB tablespace.

InnoDB now prevents a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> declaration where the signedness
is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.

Calling <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> could cause
memory corruption and make mysqld to crash.  Especially at risk was
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, because it calls frequently <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

If inserts to several tables containing an auto-inc column were wrapped
inside one <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, InnoDB asserted in lock0lock.c.
<LI>

In 3.23.47 we allowed several <CODE>NULLS</CODE> in a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> secondary
index for an InnoDB table.  But <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> was not relaxed: it
reports the table as corrupt.  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> no longer complains in
this situation.

Tim Bunce <a HREF="mailto:Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk">Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk</a> for modifying <TT>`mysql.server'</TT> to
easily handle hosts running many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> processes.
<LI>

<TT>`safe_mysqld'</TT>, <TT>`mysql.server'</TT>, and <TT>`mysql_install_db'</TT> have
been modified to use <CODE>mysql_print_defaults</CODE> instead of various hacks 
to read the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> files.  In addition, the handling of various 
paths has been made more consistent with how <CODE>mysqld</CODE> handles them 
by default.
<LI>

Automatically remove Berkeley DB transaction logs that no longer are in
use.
<LI>

Fixed bug with several <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes in one table.

<LI>

Added new options <CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>, <CODE>--no-pager</CODE>,
<CODE>--tee=...</CODE> and <CODE>--no-tee</CODE> to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  The

and the interactive help for more information.
<LI>

Fixed crash when automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table failed.
<LI>

Fixed a major performance bug in the table locking code when one
constantly had a LOT of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements running. The symptom was that the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> queries were locked for a long time while new <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements were executed before the updates.
<LI>

When reading <CODE>options_files</CODE> with <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the
<CODE>return-found-rows</CODE> option was ignored.
<LI>

One can now specify <CODE>interactive-timeout</CODE> in the option file that
is read by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>. This makes it possible to force
programs that run for a long time (like <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>) to use
<CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE> instead of <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>.
<LI>

Added to the slow query log the time and the user name for each logged
query. If you are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that
do not use an index are logged, even if the query takes less than
<CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

Fixed a problem in <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> which caused all columns in a reference
table to be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem when using <CODE>NATURAL JOIN</CODE> without keys.

<LI>

Fixed a bug where <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT * ... LIMIT #</CODE> only returned one row.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the assembler code in <CODE>strstr()</CODE> for sparc and cleaned up

<LI>

The option <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> now works properly on NT.
<LI>

Fixed a long outstanding bug in the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables when a row with a length

Changed all log files to use our own <CODE>IO_CACHE</CODE> mechanism instead of
<CODE>FILE</CODE> to avoid OS problems when there are many files open.
<LI>

Added options <CODE>--open-files</CODE> and <CODE>--timezone</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a fatal bug in <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Added variables <CODE>large_file_support</CODE>,<CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE>,
<CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE> and <CODE>query_buffer_size</CODE> to <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

Added status variables <CODE>created_tmp_files</CODE> and <CODE>sort_merge_passes</CODE>
to <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where we didn't allow an index name after the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> definition.

Added more tests to the benchmark suite.
<LI>

Fixed an overflow bug in the client code when using overly long database names.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> now aborts on Linux if the server doesn't answer in
<CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

<CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> did not work if you started with
<CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> and had not explicitly run <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed the output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> to be consistent with
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. (It now has no directory in the log name.)
<LI>

Added <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--safemalloc-mem-limit</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to simulate memory
shortage when compiled <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed several coredumps in out-of-memory conditions.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> was using an uninitialized mutex if the slave had
not been started yet.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ELT()</CODE> and <CODE>MAKE_SET()</CODE> when the query used
a temporary table.
<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> without specifying <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> would
set it to 0 instead of 4 and hit the magic number in the master binlog.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ...</CODE> syntax added.  This will create the
new table with the rows in a specific order.

If you don't create a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in a BDB table, a hidden
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be created.

<CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> in some cases preferred a full table scan when there was
no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

When using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, don't count the time waiting for a lock.
<LI>

Fixed bug in lock code on Windows which could cause the key cache
to report that the key file was crashed even if it was okay.
<LI>

Automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables if you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed the <CODE>TYPE=</CODE> keyword from <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>. Allow <CODE>CHECK</CODE> options to be combined. (You can still
use <CODE>TYPE=</CODE> but this usage is deprecated.)
<LI>

Fixed mutex bug in the binary replication log - long update queries could
be read only in part by the slave if it did it at the wrong time, which
was not fatal, but resulted in a performance-degrading reconnect and
a scary message in the error log.
<LI>

Changed the format of the binary log - added magic number, server
version, binlog version. Added server id and query error code for each
query event.
<LI>

Replication thread from the slave now will kill all the stale threads
from the same server.
<LI>

Long replication user names were not being handled properly.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--replicate-rewrite-db</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

Columns referenced in <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements now are initialized properly.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> didn't always work when used with a range on a timestamp that
was part of the key that was used to find rows.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index when inserting a <CODE>NULL</CODE> column.

MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> now starts with option
<CODE>--no-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-g</CODE>) by default. This option can be
disabled with <CODE>--enable-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-G</CODE>). This may cause
incompatibility problems in some cases, for example, in SQL scripts that

Updated <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> to use the new <CODE>FLUSH TABLES table_list</CODE>
syntax. Only tables which are being backed up are flushed now.
<LI>

Changed behavior of <CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> so
that both non-threaded (<CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE>) and threaded

Changed <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on empty tables and
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> on empty tables to create non-unique indexes

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> will now only update tables that have been changed
since thee last <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>. Note that this is a new feature and tables

<LI>

New function <CODE>LOAD_FILE(filename)</CODE> to get the contents of a file as a
string value.

<LI>

An example procedure is added: <CODE>analyse</CODE>, file: <TT>`sql_analyse.c'</TT>.
This will describe the data in your query.  Try the following:

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max elements,[max memory]])
</PRE>

This procedure is extremely useful when you want to check the data in your
table!

You can specify a netmask using the <CODE>IP/NETMASK</CODE> syntax.
<LI>

If you compare a <CODE>NOT NULL DATE/DATETIME</CODE> column with <CODE>IS
NULL</CODE>, this is changed to a compare against <CODE>0</CODE> to satisfy some ODBC
applications.  (By <a HREF="mailto:shreeve@uci.edu">shreeve@uci.edu</a>).
<LI>

<CODE>NULL IN (...)</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>0</CODE>.  This will

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Fix storage of floating-point values in <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Changed parsing of <CODE>TIME</CODE> strings to be more strict.  Now the

<LI>

Some small changes to the join table optimizer to make some joins faster.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> is much faster; It uses the new <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
functionality in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. One difference compared to MySQL Version 3.22
is that the output of <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is not sorted anymore.
<LI>

All C client API macros are now functions to make shared libraries more
reliable. Because of this, you can no longer call <CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> on
a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> object, you must use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Added use of <CODE>LIBEWRAP</CODE>;  Patch by Henning P . Schmiedehausen.

Don't allow <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> for other than numerical columns.

The 3.22 version has faster and safer connect code than version 3.21, as well

MySQL RPM will, however, start the server as before.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--bootstrap</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and recoded

inside the comments as if the surrounding <CODE>/*!</CODE> and <CODE>*/</CODE> comment
characters didn't exist.
<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name</CODE> can now be used to reclaim disk space
after many deletes.  Currently, this uses <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
regenerate the table, but in the future it will use an integrated
<CODE>isamchk</CODE> for more speed.
<LI>

Upgraded <CODE>libtool</CODE> to get the configure more portable.
<LI>

Fixed slow <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> operations when using

<LI>

Changed optimizer to make it better at deciding when to do a full join

Added handling of formats <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>,
<CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> for numbers when using <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> and

Added connect option <CODE>CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> to allow use of spaces
after function names and before <SAMP>`('</SAMP> (Powerbuilder requires this).
This will make all function names reserved words.
<LI>

Added the <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to enable timestamps

TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> under heavy usage.
Changed locking code to get better handling of locks of different types.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>DBI</CODE> to 1.00 and <CODE>DBD</CODE> to 1.2.0.
<LI>

Added a check that the error message file contains error messages suitable for
the current version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. (To avoid errors if you accidentally
try to use an old error message file.)
<LI>

All count structures in the client (<CODE>affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>insert_id()</CODE>, ...) are now of type <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to allow 64-bit values
to be used.
This required a minor change in the MySQL protocol which should affect
only old clients when using tables with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> values &#62; 16M.
<LI>

The return type of <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE> has changed from <CODE>uint *</CODE>
to <CODE>ulong *</CODE>. This may give a warning for old clients but should work
on most machines.
<LI>

Change <CODE>mysys</CODE> and <CODE>dbug</CODE> libraries to allocate all thread variables
in one struct.  This makes it easier to make a threaded <TT>`libmysql.dll'</TT>
library.
<LI>

Use the result from <CODE>gethostname()</CODE> (instead of <CODE>uname()</CODE>) when
constructing <TT>`.pid'</TT> file names.

<STRONG>WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!</STRONG>
If you set a <CODE>TIME</CODE> column to too short a value, MySQL now

Increased the default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to <CODE>1M</CODE> in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to give
table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>) lower priority than retrievals.  You can now use
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> You can
also use <CODE>SET OPTION SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES={0|1}</CODE> to change
the priority for one thread.  One side effect is that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
is now a reserved word. :(
<LI>

Add support for <CODE>INSERT INTO table ... VALUES(...),(...),(...)</CODE>,
to allow inserting multiple rows with a single statement.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO tbl_name</CODE> is now also cached when used with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.
(Previously only <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> were
cached.)

Allow <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> functions with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col FROM table GROUP BY col HAVING COUNT(*)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now ignore trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> characters in queries. This
is to make it easier to migrate from some other SQL servers that require the
trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>.
<LI>

Fix for corrupted fixed-format output generated by <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

<STRONG>WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!</STRONG>
Added Oracle <CODE>GREATEST()</CODE> and <CODE>LEAST()</CODE> functions.  You must now use

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL
</PRE>

to:

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column == LAST_INSERT_ID()

<LI>

You now MUST call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> before you call
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
You don't have to call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> if you only use
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="News-3.22.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.22.0">F.3.36  Changes in release 3.22.0</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

New (backward compatible) connect protocol that allows you to
specify the database to use when connecting, to get much faster
connections to a specific database.

The <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> call is changed to:


<PRE>
mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
                   const char *passwd, const char *db, uint port,
                   const char *unix_socket, uint client_flag)
</PRE>

<LI>

Each connection is handled by its own thread, rather than by the
master <CODE>accept()</CODE> thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.
<LI>

All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward resolution of
the hostname to get better security. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now has a local hostname
resolver cache so connections should actually be faster than before,
even with this feature.
<LI>

A site automatically will be blocked from future connections if someone
repeatedly connects with an ``improper header'' (like when one uses telnet).
<LI>

You can now refer to tables in different databases with references of the form
<CODE>tbl_name@db_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE>.  This makes it possible to
give a user read access to some tables and write access to others simply by
keeping them in different databases!
<LI>

Added <CODE>--user</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to allow it to run
as another Unix user (if it is started as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user).
<LI>

Added caching of users and access rights (for faster access rights checking)
<LI>

Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change their password with
<CODE>mysqladmin password 'new_password'</CODE>.  This uses encrypted passwords
that are not logged in the normal MySQL log!
<LI>

All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86 Linux
machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.
<LI>

For tables that have many columns, the column names are now hashed for
much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some benchmark
tests a lot!)
<LI>

Some benchmarks are changed to get better individual timing.
(Some loops were so short that a specific test took &#60; 2 seconds. The
loops have been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it easier
to compare different databases. A test that took 1-2 seconds before
now takes 11-24 seconds, which is much better)
<LI>

Re-arranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> code to handle some very specific queries
involving group functions (like <CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE>) without a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> but
with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>. The following now works:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT count(*) as C FROM table HAVING C &#62; 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid some
calls to <CODE>malloc()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-T32</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, for running all queries under the
main thread.  This makes it possible to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under Linux with
<CODE>gdb</CODE>!
<LI>

Added optimization of <CODE>not_null_column IS NULL</CODE> (needed for some Access
queries).
<LI>

Allow <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> to be used between two tables to force the optimizer
to join them in a specific order.
<LI>

String functions now return <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and
the column type is now <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> for fields saved as <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>.
This should make the <STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> driver better, but may break some old
MySQL clients that don't handle <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR</CODE> the same
way as <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> are now implemented through
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> is still the recommended (fast) way to create indexes.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> option <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added time column to <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> to show how long a query
has taken or how long a thread has slept.
<LI>

Added lots of new variables to <CODE>show variables</CODE> and some new to
<CODE>show status</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new type <CODE>YEAR</CODE>. <CODE>YEAR</CODE> is stored in 1 byte with allowable
values of 0, and 1901 to 2155.
<LI>

Added new <CODE>DATE</CODE> type that is stored in 3 bytes rather than 4 bytes.
All new tables are created with the new date type if you don't use the
<CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in record caches; for some queries, you could get
<CODE>Error from table handler: #</CODE> on some operating systems.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--enable-assembler</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>, for x86 machines
(tested on Linux + <CODE>gcc</CODE>).  This will enable assembler functions for the
most important string functions for more speed!

Sorting on calculated <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> values sorted on integer results instead.

Added Sybase command <CODE>USE DATABASE</CODE> to start using another database.

Added automatic adjusting of number of connections and table cache size
if the maximum number of files that can be opened is less than needed.
This should fix that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't crash even if you haven't done a

Fixed broken <CODE>__P_</CODE> patch in MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Many memory overrun checks. All string functions now return <CODE>NULL</CODE>
if the returned string should be longer than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.
<LI>

Changed the name of the <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> type to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, because
<CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> is used in ANSI SQL.

Lots of changes for Win95 port. In theory, this version should now be
easily portable to Win95.
<LI>

Changed the <CODE>CREATE COLUMN</CODE> syntax of <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> columns to be after
the <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value, as specified in the ANSI SQL standard. This will
make <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> and default values incompatible with
MySQL Version 3.20.

Added many function name aliases so the functions can be used with
ODBC or ANSI SQL92 syntax.

<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY</CODE> didn't work in some cases. An
<CODE>Invalid use of group function</CODE> error occurred.
<LI>

When using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT</CODE> now always uses keys instead of record
scan.  This will give better performance on <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>

Added text types <CODE>TINYTEXT</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE> and
<CODE>LONGTEXT</CODE>.  These are actually <CODE>BLOB</CODE>types, but all searching is

All old <CODE>BLOB</CODE> fields are now <CODE>TEXT</CODE> fields.  This only

Fixed some possible buffer overflows if filenames that are too long are used.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't accept hostnames that start with digits followed by a

<LI>

When comparing a <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column to a constant, the constant is converted to a time value before
performing the comparison.
This will make it easier to get ODBC (particularly Access97) to work with

At least the <CODE>isam</CODE> library should be relatively 64-bit clean.
<LI>

New <CODE>isamchk</CODE> which can detect and fix more problems.
<LI>

New options for <CODE>isamlog</CODE>.
<LI>

Using new version of Automake.
<LI>

Many small portability changes (from the AIX and alpha-digital port)
Better checking of pthread(s) library.
<LI>

czech error messages by <a HREF="mailto:snajdr@pvt.net">snajdr@pvt.net</a>.
<LI>

Decreased size of some buffers to get fewer problems on systems with little
memory.  Also added more checks to handle ``out of memory'' problems.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>: you can now do <CODE>mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8</CODE> to kill
multiple threads.
<LI>

When the maximum connection limit is reached, one extra connection by a user
with the <STRONG>PROCESS_ACL</STRONG> privilege is granted.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O backlog=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Increased maximum packet size from 512K to 1024K for client.
<LI>

Almost all of the function code is now tested in the internal test suite.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> now returns warnings from field conversions.
<LI>

Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).
<LI>

Added a fix for Visual FoxBase so that any schema name from a table
specification is automatically removed.
<LI>

New function <CODE>ASCII()</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed function <CODE>BETWEEN(a,b,c)</CODE>. Use the standard ANSI
syntax instead: <CODE>expr BETWEEN expr AND expr</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL no longer has to use an extra temporary table when sorting
on functions or <CODE>SUM()</CODE> functions.
<LI>

Fixed bug that you couldn't use <CODE>tbl_name.field_name</CODE> in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> when using 'hidden group'. For example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test
           GROUP BY some_field;
</PRE>

Note: <CODE>some_field</CODE> is normally in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. ANSI SQL should
require it.

<UL>
<LI>

New reserved words used: <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, <CODE>READ</CODE>,
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
<LI>

Added ODBC function <CODE>CHAR(num,...)</CODE>.
<LI>

New operator <CODE>IN</CODE>. This uses a binary search to find a match.
<LI>

New command <CODE>LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ|WRITE} ...</CODE>
<LI>

Added <CODE>--log-update</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to get a log suitable for
incremental updates.
<LI>

New command <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE> to get information about how the
optimizer will do the join.
<LI>

For easier client code, the client should no longer use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING</CODE> (as
previously returned by <CODE>mysql_list_fields</CODE>).  You should instead only use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_STRING</CODE>.  If you want exact
types, you should use the command <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added varbinary syntax: <CODE>0x######</CODE> which can be used as a string
(default) or a number.
<LI>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> is renamed to <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed all fields to C++ classes.
<LI>

Removed FORM struct.
<LI>

Fields with <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values no longer need to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

New field types:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ENUM</CODE>
<DD>
A string which can take only a couple of defined values. The value is
stored as a 1-3 byte number that is mapped automatically to a string.
This is sorted according to string positions!
<DT><CODE>SET</CODE>
<DD>
A string which may have one or many string values separated with ','.
The string is stored as a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-byte number where each bit stands
for a specific set member.  This is sorted according to the unsigned value
of the stored packed number.
</DL>
<LI>

Now all function calculation is done with <CODE>double</CODE> or <CODE>long long</CODE>.
This will provide the full 64-bit range with bit functions and fix some
conversions that previously could result in precision losses.  One should
avoid using <CODE>unsigned long long</CODE> columns with full 64-bit range
(numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because calculations are done
with <CODE>signed long long</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will now put <CODE>NULL</CODE> field values first. <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
will also work with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Full <CODE>WHERE</CODE> with expressions.
<LI>

New range optimizer that can resolve ranges when some keypart prefix is
constant. Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name
           WHERE key_part_1="customer"
           AND key_part_2&#62;=10 AND key_part_2&#60;=10;

Added <CODE>-p#</CODE> (remove <CODE>#</CODE> directories from path) to <CODE>isamlog</CODE>.
All files are written with a relative path from the database directory
Now <CODE>mysqld</CODE> shouldn't crash on shutdown when using the
<CODE>--log-isam</CODE> option.
<LI>

New <CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> version. It is now compatible with <CODE>msqlperl-0.63</CODE>.
<LI>

New <CODE>DBD</CODE> module available at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/</a>
site.
<LI>

Added group function <CODE>STD()</CODE> (standard deviation).
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is now compiled by default without debugging
information.  This will make the daemon smaller and faster.
<LI>

Now one usually only has to specify the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. All other paths are relative in a normal installation.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns sometimes contained garbage when used with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
on more than one table and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed that calculations that are not in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> work as expected
(ANSI SQL extension).
Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,id+1 FROM table GROUP BY id;
</PRE>

<LI>

The test of using <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> was reversed. Now <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> is
enabled as default in the default release.
<LI>

Fixed conversion bug which caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to core dump with
Arithmetic error on Sparc-386.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--unbuffered</CODE> option to <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for new <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.
<LI>

When using overlapping (unnecessary) keys and join over many tables,
the optimizer could get confused and return 0 records.

You can now use <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns and the functions <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and
<CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
<LI>

All communication packets and row buffers are now allocated dynamically
on demand. The default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is now 64K for
the server and 512K for the client. This is mainly used to catch
incorrect packets that could trash all memory. The server limit may be
changed when it is started.
<LI>

Changed stack usage to use less memory.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to check for running daemon.
<LI>

The <CODE>ELT()</CODE> function is renamed to <CODE>FIELD()</CODE>.  The new
<CODE>ELT()</CODE> function returns a value based on an index: <CODE>FIELD()</CODE>
is the inverse of <CODE>ELT()</CODE> Example: <CODE>ELT(2,"A","B","C")</CODE> returns
<CODE>"B"</CODE>. <CODE>FIELD("B","A","B","C")</CODE> returns <CODE>2</CODE>.

<CODE>COUNT(field)</CODE>, where <CODE>field</CODE> could have a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value, now
works.

Changed <CODE>sql_lex</CODE> to handle <CODE>\0</CODE> unquoted, but the client can't send
the query through the C API, because it takes a str pointer.
You must use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE> to send the query.

You can have <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions and table columns in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>

lookups.  The column that is used should be a constant for each group because
the value is calculated only once for the first row that is found for a group.

Changed SQL function <CODE>INTERVALL()</CODE> to <CODE>INTERVAL()</CODE>.
<LI>

Made <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS</CODE> a synonym for <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
Added compatibility syntax <CODE>FRIEND KEY</CODE> to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. In
MySQL, this creates a non-unique key on the given columns.
<LI>

Added <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> as compatibility functions.
In MySQL, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> only checks if the index exists and
issues an error if it doesn't exist. <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> always succeeds.
<LI>

<TT>`mysqladmin.c'</TT>: added client version to version information.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>sql_acl</CODE> (core on new connection).
<LI>

Removed <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>db</CODE> tables from database <CODE>test</CODE>
in the distribution.
<LI>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> can now be signed (-128 - 127) or unsigned (0 - 255)
Previously, it was always unsigned.
<LI>

Bug fixes in <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> and <CODE>WEEKDAY()</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed a lot of source to get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be compiled with SunPro
compiler.
<LI>

SQL functions must now have a <CODE>'('</CODE> immediately after the function name
(no intervening space).
For example, <CODE>'user('</CODE> is regarded as beginning a function call, and
<CODE>'user ('</CODE> is regarded as an identifier <CODE>user</CODE> followed by a
<CODE>'('</CODE>, not as a function call.

<UL>
<LI>

The source distribution is done with <CODE>configure</CODE> and Automake.
It will make porting much easier.  The <CODE>readline</CODE> library is included
in the distribution.
<LI>

Separate client compilation:
the client code should be very easy to compile on systems which
don't have threads.
<LI>

The old Perl interface code is automatically compiled and installed.
Automatic compiling of <CODE>DBD</CODE> will follow when the new <CODE>DBD</CODE> code
is ported.
<LI>

Dynamic language support: <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can now be started with Swedish
or English (default) error messages.
<LI>

New functions: <CODE>INSERT()</CODE>, <CODE>RTRIM()</CODE>, <CODE>LTRIM()</CODE> and
<CODE>FORMAT()</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> now works correctly for all field types (even
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>). The format for <CODE>SHOW FIELDS FROM tbl_name</CODE>
is changed so the <CODE>Type</CODE> column contains information suitable for
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  In previous releases, some <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
information had to be patched when re-creating tables.
<LI>

Some parser bugs from 3.19.5 (<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>) are corrected.
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> now returns different date information depending on its
create length.
<LI>

Changed parser to allow a database, table or field name to
start with a number or <CODE>'_'</CODE>.
<LI>

All old C code from Unireg changed to C++ and cleaned up. This makes
the daemon a little smaller and easier to understand.
<LI>

A lot of small bug fixes done.
<LI>

New <TT>`INSTALL'</TT> files (not final version) and some information regarding porting.

A working Posix thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions are not good enough) and on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, <a HREF="mailto:Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr">Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr</a>.

</P>
<P>
The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
<TT>`mit-pthreads/README'</TT> and
<a HREF="http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/"> Programming POSIX Threads</a>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL distribution includes a patched version of
Provenzano's Pthreads from MIT (see
<a HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html"> MIT Pthreads
web page</a>). This can be used for some operating systems that do not
have POSIX threads.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use another user level thread package named
FSU Pthreads (see
<a HREF="http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~mueller/pthreads.html"> FSU Pthreads
home page</a>). This implementation is being used for the SCO port.

</P>

See the <TT>`thr_lock.c'</TT> and <TT>`thr_alarm.c'</TT> programs in the <TT>`mysys'</TT>
directory for some tests/examples of these problems.

</P>
<P>
Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler (we use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
and have tried SparcWorks). Another compiler that is known to work is the
Irix <CODE>cc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To compile only the client use <CODE>./configure --without-server</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There is currently no support for only compiling the server, nor is it
likly to be added unless someone has a good reason for it.

</P>
<P>
If you want/need to change any <TT>`Makefile'</TT> or the configure script you must
get Automake and Autoconf. We have used the <CODE>automake-1.2</CODE> and

If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some debugging
of MySQL!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">G.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Before you start debugging <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, first get the test

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL,
you can try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> (which will disable all
new, potentially unsafe functionality) or with <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE> which
disables a lot of optimization that may cause problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't want to start, you should check that you don't have
any <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> files that interfere with your setup!
You can check your <CODE>my.cnf</CODE> arguments with <CODE>mysqld --print-defaults</CODE>
and avoid using them by starting with <CODE>mysqld --no-defaults ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it ``hangs'', you
can use <CODE>mysqladmin processlist status</CODE> to find out if someone is
executing a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to
run <CODE>mysqladmin -i10 processlist status</CODE> in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't connect.

</P>
<P>
The command <CODE>mysqladmin debug</CODE> will dump some information about
locks in use, used memory and query usage to the mysql log file. This
may help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

</P>
<P>
If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimize the table with <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> or
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  MySQL Database Administration</A>. You should also
check the slow queries with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Operating_System_Specific_Notes">2.6  Operating System Specific Notes</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Compiling_for_debugging" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compiling_for_debugging">G.1.1  Compiling MYSQL for debugging.</A></H3>

<P>
If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> or the <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> option.  You can check
whether or not MySQL was compiled with debugging by doing:
<CODE>mysqld --help</CODE>.  If the <CODE>--debug</CODE> flag is listed with the
options then you have debugging enabled.  <CODE>mysqladmin ver</CODE> also
lists the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version as <CODE>mysql ... --debug</CODE> in this case.

</P>
<P>
If you are using gcc or egcs, the recommended configure line is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, which will install a memory allocation
(<CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE>) checker. Running with <CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE> is however
quite slow, so if you get performance problems you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> option. This will
disable the memory overrun checks for each call to <CODE>malloc</CODE> and
<CODE>free</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> stops crashing when you compile it with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you have probably found a compiler bug or a timing
bug within MySQL.  In this case you can try to add <CODE>-g</CODE> to
the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> variables above and not use
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now dies, you can at least attach
to it with <CODE>gdb</CODE> or use <CODE>gdb</CODE> on the core file to find out
what happened.

</P>
<P>
When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a
lot of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
If they find something ``unexpected,'' an entry will be written to
<CODE>stderr</CODE>, which <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing, of course, is to
send mail to <a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a> and ask for help.  Please use the
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script for all bug reports or questions regarding the
MySQL version you are using!

In the Windows MySQL distribution, <CODE>mysqld.exe</CODE> is by
default compiled with support for trace files.

<H3><A NAME="Making_trace_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A></H3>

<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't start or if you can cause the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace
file to find the problem.

</P>
<P>
To do this you have to have a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that is compiled for debugging.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqld -V</CODE>.  If the version number
ends with <CODE>-debug</CODE>, it's compiled with support for trace files.

</P>
<P>
Start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with a trace log in <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>
(or <TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> on Windows):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug</CODE>

</P>
<P>
On Windows you should also use the <CODE>--standalone</CODE> flag to not start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service:

</P>
<P>
In a DOS window do:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld --debug --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
After this you can use the <CODE>mysql.exe</CODE> command line tool in a
second DOS window to reproduce the problem. You can take down the above
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the trace file will get very <EM>BIG</EM>!
If you want to have a smaller trace file, you can use something like:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace</CODE>

</P>
<P>
which only prints information with the most interesting tags in
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret</a> so that a MySQL
developer can take a look a this.

<P>
With some older <CODE>gdb</CODE> versions on Linux you must use <CODE>run

this case you can only have one thread active at a time.

</P>
<P>
When running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under gdb, you should disable the stack trace
with <CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE> to be able to catch segfaults within gdb.

</P>
<P>
It's very hard to debug MySQL under <CODE>gdb</CODE> if you do a lot of
new connections the whole time as <CODE>gdb</CODE> doesn't free the memory for
old threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1'</CODE>.  In most cases just
using <CODE>-O thread_cache_size=5'</CODE> will help a lot!

</P>
<P>
If you want to get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a
SIGSEGV signal, you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.
This core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you
find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died:

shell&#62; gdb mysqld core
gdb&#62;   backtrace full

Make a symbol file for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server:

<PRE>
nm -n libexec/mysqld &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

Note that many MySQL binary distributions comes with the above
file, named <CODE>mysqld.sym.gz</CODE>.  In this case you must unpack this by
doing:

<PRE>
gunzip &#60; bin/mysqld.sym.gz &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym

find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should make a bug report and include
the output from the above commend with the bug report.

Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a stack
trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to locate the bug
or provide a workaround, we would in most cases need to know the query

<P>
If you are using <CODE>--log</CODE> without a file name, the log is stored in

If you have started <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--with-myisam-recover</CODE>,
MySQL will automatically check and try to repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables if they are marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If
this happens, MySQL will write an entry in the
<CODE>hostname.err</CODE> file <CODE>'Warning: Checking table ...'</CODE> which is
followed by <CODE>Warning: Repairing table</CODE> if the table needs to be
repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without <CODE>mysqld</CODE> having
died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong and needs to
be investigated further. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  mysqld Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
It's of course not a good sign if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> did died unexpectedly,
but in this case one shouldn't investigate the <CODE>Checking table...</CODE> 
messages but instead try to find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Reproduceable_test_case" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reproduceable_test_case">G.1.6  Making a test case when you experience table corruption</A></H3>

<P>
If you get corrupted tables or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> always fails after some
update commands, you can test if this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Take down the MySQL daemon (with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).
<LI>

Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely case that
the repair will do something bad).
<LI>

Check all tables with <CODE>myisamchk -s database/*.MYI</CODE>.  Repair any
wrong tables with <CODE>myisamchk -r database/table.MYI</CODE>.
<LI>

Make a second backup of the tables.
<LI>

Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
directory if you need more space.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.
If you want to find a query that crashes <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should use
<CODE>--log --log-bin</CODE>.
<LI>

When you have gotten a crashed table, stop the <CODE>mysqld server</CODE>.
<LI>

Restore the backup.
<LI>

Restart the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server <STRONG>without</STRONG> <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>
<LI>

Re-execute the commands with <CODE>mysqlbinlog update-log-file | mysql</CODE>.
The update log is saved in the MySQL database directory with
the name <CODE>hostname-bin.#</CODE>.
<LI>

If the tables are corrupted again or you can get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to die with the
above command, you have found reproducible bug that should be easy to
fix! FTP the tables and the binary log to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret</a> and send a mail to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> or (if you are a support customer) to
<a HREF="mailto:support@mysql.com">support@mysql.com</a> about the problem and the MySQL team
will fix it as soon as possible.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the script <CODE>mysql_find_rows</CODE> to just execute some of the
update statements if you want to narrow down the problem.

<H2><A NAME="Debugging_client" HREF="manual_toc.html#Debugging_client">G.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1762"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1763"></A>

</P>
<P>
To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1764"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1765"></A>
Before running a client, you should set the <CODE>MYSQL_DEBUG</CODE> environment
variable:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
shell&#62; export MYSQL_DEBUG
</PRE>

<P>
This causes clients to generate a trace file in <TT>`/tmp/client.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running <CODE>mysql</CODE> in debugging mode (assuming you
have compiled MySQL with debugging on):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
</PRE>

<P>
This will provide useful information in case you mail a bug report.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.2.22.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> include file matches your mysql library file.
A very common mistake is to use an old <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file from an old
MySQL installation with new MySQL library.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="The_DBUG_package" HREF="manual_toc.html#The_DBUG_package">G.3  The DBUG package.</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1766"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled
with the DBUG package originally made by Fred Fish.  When one has configured
MySQL for debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace
file of what the program is debugging. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">G.1.2  Creating trace files</A>.

</P>
<P>
One uses the debug package by invoking the program with the
<CODE>--debug="..."</CODE> or the <CODE>-#...</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Most MySQL programs has a default debug string that will be
used if you don't specify an option to <CODE>--debug</CODE>.  The default
trace file is usually <CODE>/tmp/programname.trace</CODE> on Unix and
<CODE>\programname.trace</CODE> on Windows.

</P>
<P>
The debug control string is a sequence of colon separated fields
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;field_1&#62;:&#60;field_2&#62;:...:&#60;field_N&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by
an optional "," and comma-separated list of modifiers:

</P>

<PRE>
flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]
</PRE>

<P>
The currently recognized flag characters are:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>d </TD><TD> Enable output from DBUG_&#60;N&#62; macros for the current state. May be followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies output for all macros.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>D </TD><TD> Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine capabilities. That is, <CODE>-#D,20</CODE> is delay two seconds.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>f </TD><TD> Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of named functions.  Note that a null list will disable all functions.	The appropriate "d" or "t" flags must still be given, this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.

<TR><TD>F </TD><TD> Identify the source file name for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>i </TD><TD> Identify the process with the pid or thread id for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>g </TD><TD> Enable profiling.  Create a file called 'dbugmon.out' containing information that can be used to profile the program.  May be followed by a list of keywords that select profiling only for the functions in that list.  A null list implies that all functions are considered.

<TR><TD>o </TD><TD> Redirect the debugger output stream to the specified file.  The default output is stderr.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>O </TD><TD> As <CODE>O</CODE> but the file is really flushed between each write. When needed the file is closed and reopened between each write.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>p </TD><TD> Limit debugger actions to specified processes. A process must be identified with the DBUG_PROCESS macro and match one in the list for debugger actions to occur.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>P </TD><TD> Print the current process name for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>r </TD><TD> When pushing a new state, do not inherit the previous state's function nesting level. Useful when the output is to start at the left margin.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S </TD><TD> Do function _sanity(_file_,_line_) at each debugged function until _sanity() returns something that differs from 0. (Mostly used with safemalloc to find memory leaks)

</TABLE>

<P>
Some examples of debug control strings which might appear on a shell
command line (the "-#" is typically used to introduce a control string
to an application program) are:

<H2><A NAME="Locking_methods" HREF="manual_toc.html#Locking_methods">G.4  Locking methods</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1767"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1768"></A>

</P>
<P>
Currently MySQL only supports table locking for
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables and page level locking
for <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Internal_locking">5.3.1  How MySQL Locks Tables</A>.  With <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables one can freely mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> without locks
(<CODE>Versioning</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Starting in version 3.23.33, you can analyze the table lock contention
on your system by checking <CODE>Table_locks_waited</CODE> and
<CODE>Table_locks_immediate</CODE> environment variables.

</P>
<P>
Some database users claim that MySQL cannot support near the
number of concurrent users because it lacks row-level locking.  This
may be true for some specific applications, but is not generally
true. As always this depends totally on what the application does and what
is the access/update pattern of the data. 

</P>
<P>
Pros for row locking:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fewer lock conflicts when accessing different rows in many threads.
<LI>

Less changes for rollbacks.
<LI>

Makes it possible to lock a single row a long time.
</UL>

<P>
Cons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Takes more memory than page level or table locks.
<LI>

Is slower than page level or table locks when used one a big part of the table,
because one has to do many more locks.
<LI>

Is definitely much worse than other locks if you do often do <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on a large part of the data or if one has to often scan the whole table.
<LI>

With higher level locks one can also more easily support locks of
different types to tune the application as the lock overhead is less
notable as for row level locks.
</UL>

<P>
Table locks are superior to page level / row level locks in the
following cases:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mostly reads
<LI>

Read and updates on strict keys; This is where one updates or deletes
a row that can be fetched with one key read:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key#
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE unique_key=#
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> combined with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> (and very few <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>'s
and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>'s.
<LI>

Many scans / <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on the whole table without any writers.
</UL>

<P>
Other options than row / page level locking:

</P>
<P>
Versioning (like we use in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where
you can have one writer at the same time as many readers.  This means
that the database/table supports different views for the data depending
on when one started to access it. Other names for this are time travel,
copy on write or copy on demand.

</P>
<P>
Copy on demand is in many case much better than page or row level
locking; The worst case does, however, use much more memory than
when using normal locks.

</P>
<P>
Instead of using row level locks one can use application level locks.
(Like get_lock/release_lock in MySQL).  This works of course
only in well-behaved applications.

</P>
<P>
In many cases one can do an educated guess which locking type is best
for the application but generally it's very hard to say that a given
lock type is better than another; Everything depends on the application
and different part of the application may require different lock types.

</P>
<P>
Here are some tips about locking in MySQL:

</P>
<P>
On web application most applications do lots of selects, very few
deletes, updates mainly on keys and inserts in some specific tables.
The base MySQL setup is VERY tuned for this.

</P>
<P>
Concurrent users is not a problem if one doesn't mix updates and selects
that needs to examine many rows in the same table.

</P>
<P>
If one mixes inserts and deletes on the same table then <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
may be of great help.

</P>
<P>
One can also use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> to speed up things (many updates within
a single lock is much faster than updates without locks).  Splitting
thing to different tables will also helps.

</P>
<P>
If you get speed problems with the table locks in MySQL, you
may be able to solve these to convert some of your tables to <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.5  BDB or Berkeley_DB Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The optimization section in the manual covers a lot of different aspects of
how to tune ones application. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Tips">5.2.11  Other Optimization Tips</A>.

<H2><A NAME="RTS-threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#RTS-threads">G.5  Comments about RTS threads</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1769"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1770"></A>

</P>
<P>
I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but
stumbled on the following problems:

</P>
<P>
They use an old version of a lot of POSIX calls and it is very tedious to
make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

</P>
<P>
Some wrappers are already written. See <TT>`mysys/my_pthread.c'</TT> for more info.

</P>
<P>
At least the following should be changed:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>pthread_get_specific</CODE> should use one argument.
<CODE>sigwait</CODE> should take two arguments.
A lot of functions (at least <CODE>pthread_cond_wait</CODE>,
<CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait</CODE>)
should return the error code on error. Now they return -1 and set <CODE>errno</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another problem is that user-level threads use the <CODE>ALRM</CODE> signal and this
aborts a lot of functions (<CODE>read</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE>, <CODE>open</CODE>...).
MySQL should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is
not that easy to verify it.

</P>
<P>
The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

</P>
<P>
To get thread-level alarms I changed <TT>`mysys/thr_alarm.c'</TT> to wait between
alarms with <CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait()</CODE>, but this aborts with error
<CODE>EINTR</CODE>.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

</P>
<P>
If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
This shouldn't take that long.
<LI>

Compile all libraries with the <CODE>-DHAVE_rts_threads</CODE>.
<LI>

Compile <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>.
<LI>

If there are some small differences in the implementation, they may be fixed
by changing <TT>`my_pthread.h'</TT> and <TT>`my_pthread.c'</TT>.
<LI>

Run <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>. If it runs without any ``warning'', ``error'' or aborted
messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful run on
Solaris:

<H2><A NAME="Thread_packages" HREF="manual_toc.html#Thread_packages">G.6  Differences between different thread packages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1771"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when
choosing a good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very
important.

</P>
<P>
There are at least three types of thread packages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe functions
with locks. Read, write and select operations are usually managed with a
thread-specific select that switches to another thread if the running
threads have to wait for data.  If the user thread packages are
integrated in the standard libs (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread
package requires less overhead than thread packages that have to map all
unsafe calls (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread safe so the
mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).  Downside: All
mapped calls take a little time and it's quite tricky to be able to
handle all situations. There are usually also some system calls that are
not handled by the thread package (like MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread
scheduling isn't always optimal.
<LI>

User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between threads.
LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of processes. Thread
creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest are usually left hanging
and you must kill them all before restarting. Thread switching is
somewhat expensive.
<LI>

Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library or the
kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process, but on some
systems, <CODE>ps</CODE> may show the different threads. If one thread aborts, the
whole process aborts. Most system calls are thread safe and should
require very little overhead.  Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and OSF1 have kernel
threads.
</UL>

<P>
In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user
level threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread
switching can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't
really ``thread aware''.

</P>

<P>
Note that any options on the command line will take precedence over
values specified in configuration files and environment variables, and
values in configuration files take precedence over values in environment

<H1><A NAME="Regexp" HREF="manual_toc.html#Regexp">I  Description of MySQL regular expression syntax</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1813"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1814"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1815"></A>

</P>
<P>
A regular expression (regex) is a powerful way of specifying a complex search.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses Henry Spencer's implementation of regular
expressions, which is aimed at conformance with POSIX
1003.2. MySQL uses the extended version.

</P>
<P>
This is a simplistic reference that skips the details. To get more exact
information, see Henry Spencer's <CODE>regex(7)</CODE> manual page that is
included in the source distribution. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Credits">E  Credits</A>.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest regexp is
one that has no special characters in it. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello</CODE> matches <CODE>hello</CODE> and nothing else.

</P>
<P>
Non-trivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that
they can match more than one string. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello|word</CODE> matches either the string <CODE>hello</CODE> or the string
<CODE>word</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As a more complex example, the regexp <CODE>B[an]*s</CODE> matches any of the
strings <CODE>Bananas</CODE>, <CODE>Baaaaas</CODE>, <CODE>Bs</CODE>, and any other string
starting with a <CODE>B</CODE>, ending with an <CODE>s</CODE>, and containing any
number of <CODE>a</CODE> or <CODE>n</CODE> characters in between.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression may use any of the following special
characters/constructs:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^</CODE>
<DD>
Match the beginning of a string.

mysql&#62; select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba*n";              -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a+</CODE>
<DD>
Match any sequence of one or more <CODE>a</CODE> characters.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba+n";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba+n";              -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>
<DD>
Match either zero or one <CODE>a</CODE> character.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba?n";              -&#62; 1

mysql&#62; select "pipi" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";          -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>{1}</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>{2,3}</CODE>
<DD>
The is a more general way of writing regexps that match many
occurrences of the previous atom.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a*</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a+</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{1,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,1}</CODE>.
</DL>
To be more precise, an atom followed by a bound containing one integer
<CODE>i</CODE> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <CODE>i</CODE> matches of
the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <CODE>i</CODE>
and a comma matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> or more matches of the atom.
An atom followed by a bound containing two integers <CODE>i</CODE> and
<CODE>j</CODE> matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> through <CODE>j</CODE> (inclusive)
matches of the atom.

Both arguments must be in the range from <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>RE_DUP_MAX</CODE>
(default 255), inclusive.  If there are two arguments, the second must be
greater than or equal to the first.
<DT><CODE>[a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[^a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
Matches
any character which is (or is not, if ^ is used) either <CODE>a</CODE>, <CODE>b</CODE>,
<CODE>c</CODE>, <CODE>d</CODE> or <CODE>X</CODE>. To include a literal <CODE>]</CODE> character,
it must immediately follow the opening bracket <CODE>[</CODE>.  To include a
literal <CODE>-</CODE> character, it must be written first or last. So
<CODE>[0-9]</CODE> matches any decimal digit. Any character that does not have
a defined meaning inside a <CODE>[]</CODE> pair has no special meaning and
matches only itself.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "aXbc" REGEXP "[a-dXYZ]";         -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]$";       -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]+$";      -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";     -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; select "gheis" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";    -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "gheisa" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";   -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[.characters.]]</CODE>
<DD>
The sequence of characters of that collating element. The sequence is a
single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket expression
containing a multi-character collating element can thus match more than
one character, for example, if the collating sequence includes a <CODE>ch</CODE>
collating element, then the regular expression <CODE>[[.ch.]]*c</CODE> matches the
first five characters of <CODE>chchcc</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>[=character_class=]</CODE>
<DD>
An equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters of all
collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself.

For example, if <CODE>o</CODE> and <CODE>(+)</CODE> are the members of an
equivalence class, then <CODE>[[=o=]]</CODE>, <CODE>[[=(+)=]]</CODE>, and
<CODE>[o(+)]</CODE> are all synonymous. An equivalence class may not be an
endpoint of a range.

<DT><CODE>[:character_class:]</CODE>
<DD>
Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class enclosed in
<CODE>[:</CODE> and <CODE>:]</CODE> stands for the list of all characters belonging
to that class. Standard character class names are:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>alnum </TD><TD> digit </TD><TD> punct
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>alpha </TD><TD> graph </TD><TD> space
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>blank </TD><TD> lower </TD><TD> upper
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>cntrl </TD><TD> print </TD><TD> xdigit
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

These stand for the character classes defined in the <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE> manual
page. A locale may provide others. A character class may not be used as an
endpoint of a range.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "justalnums" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";       -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "!!" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";               -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[:&#60;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[[:&#62;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
These match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
respectively.  A word is defined as a sequence of word characters which
is neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word character is
an alnum character (as defined by <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE>) or an underscore
(<CODE>_</CODE>).

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select "a word a" REGEXP "[[:&#60;:]]word[[:&#62;:]]";      -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; select "a xword a" REGEXP "[[:&#60;:]]word[[:&#62;:]]";     -&#62; 0

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1816"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1817"></A>

</P>
<P>
Unireg is our tty interface builder, but it uses a low-level connection
to our ISAM (which is used by MySQL) and because of this it is
very quick. It has existed since 1979 (on Unix in C since ~1986).

</P>
<P>
Unireg has the following components:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

One table viewer with updates/browsing.
<LI>

Multi table viewer (with one scrolling region).
<LI>

Table creator. (With lots of column tags you can't create with MySQL)
This is WYSIWYG (for a tty). You design a screen and Unireg prompts for
the column specification.
<LI>

Report generator.
<LI>

A lot of utilities (quick import/export of tables to/from text files,
analysis of table contents...).
<LI>

Powerful multi-table updates (which we use a lot) with a BASIC-like
language with LOTS of functions.
<LI>

Dynamic languages (at present in Swedish and Finnish). If somebody wants
an English version there are a few files that would have to be translated.
<LI>

The ability to run updates interactively or in a batch.
<LI>

Emacs-like key definitions with keyboard macros.
<LI>

All this in a binary of 800K.
<LI>

The <CODE>convform</CODE> utility. Converts <TT>`.frm'</TT> and text files between
different character sets.
<LI>

The <CODE>myisampack</CODE> utility. Packs an ISAM table (makes it 50-80%
smaller). The table can be read by MySQL like an ordinary
table. Only one record has to be decompressed per access. Cannot handle
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns or updates (yet).
</UL>

<P>
We update most of our production databases with the Unireg interface and
serve web pages through MySQL (and in some extreme cases the Unireg
report generator).

</P>
<P>
Unireg takes about 3M of disk space and works on at least the following
platforms: SunOS 4.x, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, ICL Unix, DNIX, SCO and
MS-DOS.

</P>
<P>
Unireg is currently only available in Swedish and Finnish.

</P>
<P>
The price tag for Unireg is 10,000 Swedish kr (about $1500 US), but this
includes support. Unireg is distributed as a binary. (But all the ISAM
sources can be found in MySQL). Usually we compile the binary for the
customer at their site.

</P>
<P>
All new development is concentrated to MySQL.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC789" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC789">K.1  Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC790" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC790">K.2  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>9.4  NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<LI>

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<LI>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<H2><A NAME="SEC791" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC791">K.3  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H2>

<P>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

</P>
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC793" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC793">L.1  Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

</P>
<P>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</P>
<P>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

</P>
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

</P>
<P>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

</P>
<P>
  We call this license the <STRONG>Lesser</STRONG> General Public License because it
does <EM>Less</EM> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</P>
<P>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

</P>
<P>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

</P>
<P>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC794" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC794">L.2  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each
licensee is addressed as ``you''.

  A ``library'' means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the
Library'' means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ``modification''.)

  ``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

The modified work must itself be a software library.

<LI>

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ``work that uses the Library''.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ``work that uses the
library''.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a ``work that uses the Library'' uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<LI>

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ``work that
uses the Library'', as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

<LI>

Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

<LI>

Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

<LI>

If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

<LI>

Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</OL>

  For an executable, the required form of the ``work that uses the
Library'' must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

<LI>

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

<LI>

Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</OL>

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
``any later version'', you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

(for example, <CODE>pc-linux-gnu-i586</CODE>).

<LI>

If you see a binary distribution marked with the <CODE>-max</CODE> prefix, this
means that the binary has support for transaction-safe tables and other
features. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  mysqld-max, An extended mysqld server</A>.  Note that all binaries
are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

<LI>

Add a user and group for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
</PRE>

These commands add the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user.  The
syntax for <CODE>useradd</CODE> and <CODE>groupadd</CODE> may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called <CODE>adduser</CODE> and <CODE>addgroup</CODE>.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of <CODE>mysql</CODE>.

<LI>

Change into the intended installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /usr/local
</PRE>

<LI>

Unpack the distribution and create the installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell&#62; ln -s mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
</PRE>

The first command creates a directory named <TT>`mysql-VERSION-OS'</TT>.  The
second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This lets you refer
more easily to the installation directory as <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql
</PRE>

You will find several files and subdirectories in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> directory.
The most important for installation purposes are the <TT>`bin'</TT> and
<TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectories.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`bin'</TT>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1830"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1831"></A>
This directory contains client programs and the server
You should add the full pathname of this directory to your
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
programs properly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">H  Environment Variables</A>.

<DT><TT>`scripts'</TT>
<DD>
This directory contains the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script used to initialize
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database containing the grant tables that store the server
access permissions.
</DL>

<LI>

If you would like to use <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> and have the MySQL
distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the location where
<CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> expects to find the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  Edit the
<TT>`bin/mysqlaccess'</TT> script at approximately line 18.  Search for a line
that looks like this:


<PRE>
$MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable
</PRE>

Change the path to reflect the location where <CODE>mysql</CODE> actually is
stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a <CODE>Broken
pipe</CODE> error when you run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.

<LI>

Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
installed MySQL before):

<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
MySQL server when you run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  This is no
longer true!

<LI>

Change ownership of binaries to <CODE>root</CODE> and ownership of the data 
directory to the user that you will run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

The first command changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the files to the
<CODE>root</CODE> user, the second one changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the 
data directory to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user, and the third one changes the
<CODE>group</CODE> attribute to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group.

<LI>

If you want to install support for the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_support">M.2  Perl Installation Comments</A>.

<LI>

If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy <CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
<CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> script itself and in 
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

</OL>

<P>
After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should initialize
and test your distribution.

</P>
<P>
You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;

<P>
Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the
<CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> client interface.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl">8.2  MySQL Perl API</A>.  The Perl
<CODE>DBD</CODE>/<CODE>DBI</CODE> client code requires Perl Version 5.004 or later.  The
interface <STRONG>will not work</STRONG> if you have an older version of Perl.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support also requires that you've installed
MySQL client programming support.  If you installed MySQL
from RPM files, client programs are in the client RPM, but client programming
support is in the developer RPM.  Make sure you've installed the latter RPM.

</P>
<P>
As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is distributed separately from the main
MySQL distribution.  If you want to install Perl support, the files
you will need can be obtained from 
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/</a>.

</P>
<P>
The Perl distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> archives and
have names like <TT>`MODULE-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT>, where <CODE>MODULE</CODE> is the
module name and <CODE>VERSION</CODE> is the version number.  You should get the
<CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE>, <CODE>DBI</CODE>, and <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distributions
and install them in that order.  The installation procedure is shown below.
The example shown is for the <CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE> module, but the procedure is
the same for all three distributions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; Data-Dumper-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

This command creates a directory named <TT>`Data-Dumper-VERSION'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd Data-Dumper-VERSION
</PRE>

<LI>

Build the distribution and compile everything:

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make test
shell&#62; make install
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
The <CODE>make test</CODE> command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
<CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE>
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as all your <CODE>DBI</CODE> scripts
dumping core after you upgrade MySQL.

To install the MySQL <CODE>DBD</CODE> module with ActiveState Perl on
Windows, you should do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get ActiveState Perl from 
<a HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/index.html">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/index.html</a>
and install it.

<LI>

Open a DOS shell.

<LI>

If required, set the HTTP_proxy variable. For example, you might try:


<PRE>
set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128
</PRE>

<LI>

Start the PPM program: 


<PRE>
C:\&#62; c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl
</PRE>

<LI>

If you have not already done so, install <CODE>DBI</CODE>:


<PRE>
ppm&#62; install DBI
</PRE>

<LI>

If this succeeds, run the following command:


<PRE>
install ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The above should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

</P>
<P>
If you can't get the above to work, you should instead install the
<STRONG>MyODBC</STRONG> driver and connect to MySQL server through
ODBC:

</P>

If Perl reports that it can't find the <TT>`../mysql/mysql.so'</TT> module,
then the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
You can fix this by any of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Compile the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distribution with <CODE>perl
Makefile.PL -static -config</CODE> rather than <CODE>perl Makefile.PL</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <CODE>libmysqlclient.so</CODE> to the directory where your other shared
libraries are located (probably <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT> or <TT>`/lib'</TT>).

<LI>

On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located to the <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT> file.

<A NAME="IDX1839"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1840"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the following errors from <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>,
you are probably using <CODE>gcc</CODE> (or using an old binary compiled with
<CODE>gcc</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc</CODE> to the link command when the
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> library gets built (check the output from <CODE>make</CODE> for
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> when you compile the Perl client).  The <CODE>-L</CODE> option
should specify the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> is located
on your system.

</P>
<P>
Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.

</PRE>

<P>
it means that you need to include the compression library, -lz, to the
link line. This can be doing the following change in the file
<TT>`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
$sysliblist .= " -lm";

to

$sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";
</PRE>

<P>
After this, you MUST run 'make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support dynamic
linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of Perl that includes
<CODE>DBI</CODE> and <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>.  The way this works is that you generate a
version of Perl with the <CODE>DBI</CODE> code linked in and install it on top of
your current Perl.  Then you use that to build a version of Perl that
additionally has the <CODE>DBD</CODE> code linked in, and install that.

</P>
<P>
On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
or
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/skunk/man:
</PRE>

<P>
First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked <CODE>DBI</CODE> by running
these commands in the directory where your <CODE>DBI</CODE> distribution is
located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Then you must install the new Perl. The output of <CODE>make perl</CODE> will
indicate the exact <CODE>make</CODE> command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is <CODE>make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl
MAP_TARGET=perl</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also includes a
statically-linked <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> by running these commands in the
directory where your <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distribution is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of <CODE>make
perl</CODE> indicates the command to use.

<P>
If you use a group function in a statement containing no <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
clause, it is equivalent to grouping on all rows.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>COUNT(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1843"></A>
 
Returns a count of the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in the rows
retrieved by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select student.student_name,COUNT(*)
           from student,course
           where student.student_id=course.student_id
           GROUP BY student_name;

</PRE>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is somewhat different in that it returns a count of
the number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is optimized to
return very quickly if the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves from one table, no
other columns are retrieved, and there is no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select COUNT(*) from student;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1844"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1845"></A>
<DT><CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT expr,[expr...])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a count of the number of different non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select COUNT(DISTINCT results) from student;
</PRE>

In MySQL you can get the number of distinct expression
combinations that don't contain NULL by giving a list of expressions.
In ANSI SQL you would have to do a concatenation of all expressions
inside <CODE>CODE(DISTINCT ..)</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1846"></A>
<DT><CODE>AVG(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the average value of <CODE>expr</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select student_name, AVG(test_score)
           from student
           GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1847"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1848"></A>
<DT><CODE>MIN(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>MAX(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the minimum or maximum value of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX()</CODE> may take a string argument; in such cases they return the
minimum or maximum string value. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; select student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)
           from student
           GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1849"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUM(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the sum of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  Note that if the return set has no rows,
it returns NULL!

<A NAME="IDX1850"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1851"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1852"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1853"></A>
<DT><CODE>STD(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>STDDEV(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the standard deviation of <CODE>expr</CODE>. This is an extension to
ANSI SQL. The <CODE>STDDEV()</CODE> form of this function is provided for Oracle
compatibility.

<A NAME="IDX1854"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIT_OR(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the bitwise <CODE>OR</CODE> of all bits in <CODE>expr</CODE>. The calculation is
performed with 64-bit (<CODE>BIGINT</CODE>) precision.

<A NAME="IDX1855"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIT_AND(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the bitwise <CODE>AND</CODE> of all bits in <CODE>expr</CODE>. The calculation is
performed with 64-bit (<CODE>BIGINT</CODE>) precision.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1856"></A>
MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. You can use columns or
calculations in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions that don't appear in
the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part. This stands for <EM>any possible value for this
group</EM>.  You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
<CODE>customer.name</CODE> in the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; select order.custid,customer.name,max(payments)
       from order,customer
       where order.custid = customer.custid
       GROUP BY order.custid;
</PRE>

<P>
In ANSI SQL, you would have to add <CODE>customer.name</CODE> to the <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in
ANSI mode.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Don't use this feature</STRONG> if the columns you omit from the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part aren't unique in the group!  You will get
unpredictable results.

</P>
<P>
In some cases, you can use <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
<CODE>column</CODE> from the row containing the smallest value in the <CODE>sort</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
substr(MIN(concat(rpad(sort,6,' '),column)),7)
</PRE>

<P>

<A NAME="IDX1861"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1862"></A>
Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22 (or earlier) or if
you are trying to follow ANSI SQL, you can't use expressions in <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses.  You can work around this limitation by
using an alias for the expression:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) AS val FROM tbl_name
           GROUP BY id,val ORDER BY val;
</PRE>

In MySQL Version 3.23 you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) FROM tbl_name ORDER BY RAND();
