Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution
======================================

* Menu:

* Linux-RPM::                   Linux RPM files
* Building clients::            Building client programs

You need the following tools to install a MySQL binary distribution:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution. GNU `tar' is known
     to work.  Sun `tar' is known to have problems.

An alternative installation method under Linux is to use RPM (RedHat
Package Manager) distributions.  *Note Linux-RPM::.

If you run into problems, *PLEASE ALWAYS USE* `mysqlbug' when posting
questions to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.  Even if the problem isn't a bug,
`mysqlbug' gathers system information that will help others solve your
problem.  By not using `mysqlbug', you lessen the likelihood of getting
a solution to your problem!  You will find `mysqlbug' in the `bin'
directory after you unpack the distribution.  *Note Bug reports::.

The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL binary
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> cd /usr/local
     shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     shell> ln -s mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
     shell> cd mysql
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
     shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
     shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
     shell> chown -R root /usr/local/mysql/bin
     shell> bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

You can add new users using the `bin/mysql_setpermission' script if you
install the `DBI' and `Msql-Mysql-modules' Perl modules.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a binary distribution, follow the steps below, then proceed
to *Note Post-installation::, for post-installation setup and testing:

  1. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it.  In the example below, we unpack
     the distribution under `/usr/local' and create a directory
     `/usr/local/mysql' into which MySQL is installed.  (The following
     instructions therefore assume you have permission to create files
     in `/usr/local'.  If that directory is protected, you will need to
     perform the installation as `root'.)

  2. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

     MySQL binary distributions are provided as compressed `tar'
     archives and have names like `mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz', where
     `VERSION' is a number (for example, `3.21.15'), and `OS' indicates
     the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
     (for example, `pc-linux-gnu-i586').

  3. If you see a binary distribution marked with the `-max' prefix,
     this means that the binary has support for transaction-safe tables
     and other features. *Note `mysqld-max': mysqld-max.  Note that all
     binaries are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

  4. Add a user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group and the `mysql' user.  The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix.  They may also be called `adduser' and
     `addgroup'.  You may wish to call the user and group something
     else instead of `mysql'.

  5. Change into the intended installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local

  6. Unpack the distribution and create the installation directory:

          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
          shell> ln -s mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

     The first command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION-OS'.
     The second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This
     lets you refer more easily to the installation directory as
     `/usr/local/mysql'.

  7. Change into the installation directory:

          shell> cd mysql

     You will find several files and subdirectories in the `mysql'
     directory.  The most important for installation purposes are the
     `bin' and `scripts' subdirectories.

    `bin'
          This directory contains client programs and the server You
          should add the full pathname of this directory to your `PATH'
          environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
          programs properly. *Note Environment variables::.

    `scripts'
          This directory contains the `mysql_install_db' script used to
          initialize the `mysql' database containing the grant tables
          that store the server access permissions.

  8. If you would like to use `mysqlaccess' and have the MySQL
     distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the
     location where `mysqlaccess' expects to find the `mysql' client.
     Edit the `bin/mysqlaccess' script at approximately line 18.
     Search for a line that looks like this:

          $MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable

     Change the path to reflect the location where `mysql' actually is
     stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a
     `Broken pipe' error when you run `mysqlaccess'.

  9. Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
     installed MySQL before):
          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
     MySQL server when you run `mysql_install_db'.  This is no longer
     true!

 10. Change ownership of binaries to `root' and ownership of the data
     directory to the user that you will run `mysqld' as:

          shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
          shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
          shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql

     The first command changes the `owner' attribute of the files to the
     `root' user, the second one changes the `owner' attribute of the
     data directory to the `mysql' user, and the third one changes the
     `group' attribute to the `mysql' group.

 11. If you want to install support for the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' interface,
     see *Note Perl support::.

 12. If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files.  More information can be
     found in the `support-files/mysql.server' script itself and in
     *Note Automatic start::.


After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should initialize
and test your distribution.

You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

     shell> bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

*Note `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

*Note Post-installation::.


Perl Installation Comments

* Windows Perl::                Installing the MySQL Perl distribution on Windows
* Perl support problems::       Problems using the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' interface


Installing Perl on Unix
-----------------------

Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the `DBI'/`DBD' client
interface.  *Note Perl::.  The Perl `DBD'/`DBI' client code requires
Perl Version 5.004 or later.  The interface *will not work* if you have
an older version of Perl.

MySQL Perl support also requires that you've installed MySQL client
programming support.  If you installed MySQL from RPM files, client
programs are in the client RPM, but client programming support is in
the developer RPM.  Make sure you've installed the latter RPM.

As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is distributed separately from the
main MySQL distribution.  If you want to install Perl support, the files
you will need can be obtained from
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/'.

The Perl distributions are provided as compressed `tar' archives and
have names like `MODULE-VERSION.tar.gz', where `MODULE' is the module
name and `VERSION' is the version number.  You should get the
`Data-Dumper', `DBI', and `Msql-Mysql-modules' distributions and
install them in that order.  The installation procedure is shown below.
The example shown is for the `Data-Dumper' module, but the procedure is
the same for all three distributions:

  1. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
          shell> gunzip < Data-Dumper-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     This command creates a directory named `Data-Dumper-VERSION'.

  2. Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:
          shell> cd Data-Dumper-VERSION

  3. Build the distribution and compile everything:
          shell> perl Makefile.PL
          shell> make
          shell> make test
          shell> make install

The `make test' command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
`Msql-Mysql-modules' installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the `Msql-Mysql-modules'
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL, particularly
if you notice symptoms such as all your `DBI' scripts dumping core
after you upgrade MySQL.

If you don't have the right to install Perl modules in the system
directory or if you to install local Perl modules, the following
reference may help you:

     `http://www.iserver.com/support/contrib/perl5/modules.html'

Look under the heading `Installing New Modules that Require Locally
Installed Modules'.


Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows
--------------------------------------

To install the MySQL `DBD' module with ActiveState Perl on Windows, you
should do the following:

   * Get ActiveState Perl from
     `http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/index.html' and
     install it.

   * Open a DOS shell.

   * If required, set the HTTP_proxy variable. For example, you might
     try:

          set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128

   * Start the PPM program:

          C:\> c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl

   * If you have not already done so, install `DBI':

          ppm> install DBI

   * If this succeeds, run the following command:

          install ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd

The above should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

If you can't get the above to work, you should instead install the
*MyODBC* driver and connect to MySQL server through ODBC:

     use DBI;
     $dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn","$user","$password") ||
       die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";


Installing the MySQL Perl Distribution on Windows
-------------------------------------------------

The MySQL Perl distribution contains `DBI', `DBD:MySQL' and `DBD:ODBC'.

   * Get the Perl distribution for Windows from
     `http://www.mysql.com/download.html'.

   * Unzip the distribution in `C:' so that you get a `C:\PERL'
     directory.

   * Add the directory `C:\PERL\BIN' to your path.

   * Add the directory `C:\PERL\BIN\MSWIN32-x86-thread' or
     `C:\PERL\BIN\MSWIN32-x86' to your path.

   * Test that `perl' works by executing `perl -v' in a DOS shell.


Problems Using the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' Interface
---------------------------------------------

If Perl reports that it can't find the `../mysql/mysql.so' module, then
the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
`libmysqlclient.so'.

You can fix this by any of the following methods:

   * Compile the `Msql-Mysql-modules' distribution with `perl
     Makefile.PL -static -config' rather than `perl Makefile.PL'.

   * Copy `libmysqlclient.so' to the directory where your other shared
     libraries are located (probably `/usr/lib' or `/lib').

   * On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
     `libmysqlclient.so' is located to the `/etc/ld.so.conf' file.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable.

If you get the following errors from `DBD-mysql', you are probably
using `gcc' (or using an old binary compiled with `gcc'):

     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'

Add `-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc' to the link command when the
`mysql.so' library gets built (check the output from `make' for
`mysql.so' when you compile the Perl client).  The `-L' option should
specify the pathname of the directory where `libgcc.a' is located on
your system.

Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with `gcc'.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with `gcc'.

If you get the following error from `Msql-Mysql-modules' when you run
the tests:

     t/00base............install_driver(mysql) failed: Can't load '../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so' for module DBD::mysql: ../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so: undefined symbol: uncompress at /usr/lib/perl5/5.00503/i586-linux/DynaLoader.pm line 169.

it means that you need to include the compression library, -lz, to the
link line. This can be doing the following change in the file
`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm':

     $sysliblist .= " -lm";
     
     to
     
     $sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";

After this, you MUST run 'make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of Perl
that includes `DBI' and `DBD-mysql'.  The way this works is that you
generate a version of Perl with the `DBI' code linked in and install it
on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to build a version of
Perl that additionally has the `DBD' code linked in, and install that.

On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
     or
     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/skunk/man:

First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked `DBI' by running
these commands in the directory where your `DBI' distribution is
located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Then you must install the new Perl. The output of `make perl' will
indicate the exact `make' command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is `make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl
MAP_TARGET=perl'.

Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also
includes a statically-linked `DBD::mysql' by running these commands in
the directory where your `Msql-Mysql-modules' distribution is located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of `make
perl' indicates the command to use.


Functions for Use with `GROUP BY' Clauses
=========================================

If you use a group function in a statement containing no `GROUP BY'
clause, it is equivalent to grouping on all rows.

`COUNT(expr)'
     Returns a count of the number of non-`NULL' values in the rows
     retrieved by a `SELECT' statement:

          mysql> select student.student_name,COUNT(*)
                     from student,course
                     where student.student_id=course.student_id
                     GROUP BY student_name;

     `COUNT(*)' is somewhat different in that it returns a count of the
     number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain `NULL'
     values.

     `COUNT(*)' is optimized to return very quickly if the `SELECT'
     retrieves from one table, no other columns are retrieved, and
     there is no `WHERE' clause.  For example:

          mysql> select COUNT(*) from student;

`COUNT(DISTINCT expr,[expr...])'
     Returns a count of the number of different non-`NULL' values:

          mysql> select COUNT(DISTINCT results) from student;

     In MySQL you can get the number of distinct expression
     combinations that don't contain NULL by giving a list of
     expressions.  In ANSI SQL you would have to do a concatenation of
     all expressions inside `CODE(DISTINCT ..)'.

`AVG(expr)'
     Returns the average value of `expr':

          mysql> select student_name, AVG(test_score)
                     from student
                     GROUP BY student_name;

`MIN(expr)'
`MAX(expr)'
     Returns the minimum or maximum value of `expr'.  `MIN()' and
     `MAX()' may take a string argument; in such cases they return the
     minimum or maximum string value. *Note MySQL indexes::.

          mysql> select student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)
                     from student
                     GROUP BY student_name;

`SUM(expr)'
     Returns the sum of `expr'.  Note that if the return set has no
     rows, it returns NULL!

`STD(expr)'
`STDDEV(expr)'
     Returns the standard deviation of `expr'. This is an extension to
     ANSI SQL. The `STDDEV()' form of this function is provided for
     Oracle compatibility.

`BIT_OR(expr)'
     Returns the bitwise `OR' of all bits in `expr'. The calculation is
     performed with 64-bit (`BIGINT') precision.

`BIT_AND(expr)'
     Returns the bitwise `AND' of all bits in `expr'. The calculation is
     performed with 64-bit (`BIGINT') precision.

MySQL has extended the use of `GROUP BY'. You can use columns or
calculations in the `SELECT' expressions that don't appear in the
`GROUP BY' part. This stands for _any possible value for this group_.
You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
`customer.name' in the following query:

     mysql> select order.custid,customer.name,max(payments)
            from order,customer
            where order.custid = customer.custid
            GROUP BY order.custid;

In ANSI SQL, you would have to add `customer.name' to the `GROUP BY'
clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in ANSI mode.

*Don't use this feature* if the columns you omit from the `GROUP BY'
part aren't unique in the group!  You will get unpredictable results.

In some cases, you can use `MIN()' and `MAX()' to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
`column' from the row containing the smallest value in the `sort'
column:

     substr(MIN(concat(rpad(sort,6,' '),column)),7)

*Note example-Maximum-column-group-row::.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22 (or earlier) or if you
are trying to follow ANSI SQL, you can't use expressions in `GROUP BY'
or `ORDER BY' clauses.  You can work around this limitation by using an
alias for the expression:

     mysql> SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) AS val FROM tbl_name
                GROUP BY id,val ORDER BY val;

In MySQL Version 3.23 you can do:

     mysql> SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) FROM tbl_name ORDER BY RAND();
