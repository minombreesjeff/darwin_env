What Is MySQL
-------------

MySQL, the most popular Open Source SQL database, is provided by MySQL
AB.  MySQL AB is a commercial company that builds its business
providing services around the MySQL database.  *Note What is MySQL AB::.

MySQL is a database management system.
     A database is a structured collection of data.  It may be anything
     from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast
     amounts of information in a corporate network.  To add, access,
     and process data stored in a computer database, you need a
     database management system such as MySQL.  Since computers are
     very good at handling large amounts of data, database management
     plays a central role in computing, as stand-alone utilities, or as
     parts of other applications.

MySQL is a relational database management system.
     A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than
     putting all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and
     flexibility.  The tables are linked by defined relations making it
     possible to combine data from several tables on request.  The SQL
     part of MySQL stands for "Structured Query Language" - the most
     common standardized language used to access databases.

MySQL is Open Source Software.
     Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify.
     Anybody can download MySQL from the Internet and use it without
     paying anything.  Anybody so inclined can study the source code
     and change it to fit their needs.  MySQL uses the GPL (GNU General
     Public License) `http://www.gnu.org', to define what you may and
     may not do with the software in different situations.  If you feel
     uncomfortable with the GPL or need to embed MySQL into a
     commercial application you can buy a commercially licensed version
     from us.

Why use MySQL?
     MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.  If that is what
     you are looking for, you should give it a try.  MySQL also has a
     very practical set of features developed in very close cooperation
     with our users.  You can find a performance comparison of MySQL to
     some other database managers on our benchmark page.  *Note MySQL
     Benchmarks::.

     MySQL was originally developed to handle very large databases much
     faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in
     highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though
     under constant development, MySQL today offers a rich and very
     useful set of functions.  The connectivity, speed, and security
     make MySQL highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

The technical features of MySQL
     For advanced technical information, see *Note Reference::.  MySQL
     is a client/server system that consists of a multi-threaded SQL
     server that supports different backends, several different client
     programs and libraries, administrative tools, and several
     programming interfaces.

     We also provide MySQL as a multi-threaded library which you can
     link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier to
     manage product.

MySQL has a lot of contributed software available.
     It is very likely that you will find that your favorite
     application or language already supports MySQL.

The official way to pronounce MySQL is "My Ess Que Ell" (not
MY-SEQUEL). But we try to avoid correcting people who say MY-SEQUEL.

What Is MySQL AB
----------------

MySQL AB is the Swedish company owned and run by the MySQL founders and
main developers.  We are dedicated to developing MySQL and spreading
our database to new users.  MySQL AB owns the copyright to the MySQL
server source code and the MySQL trademark.  A significant amount of
revenues from our services goes to developing MySQL.  *Note What-is::.

MySQL AB has been profitable providing MySQL from the start.  We don't
get any outside funding, but have earned all our money ourselves.

We are searching after partners that would like to support our
development of MySQL so that we could accelerate the development pace.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Manual conventions,  Next: History,  Prev: Manual-info,  Up: MySQL and MySQL AB

Conventions Used in This Manual
-------------------------------

This manual uses certain typographical conventions:

`constant'
     Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL
     statements; database, table and column names; C and Perl code; and
     environment variables.  Example: "To see how `mysqladmin' works,
     invoke it with the `--help' option."

`filename'
     Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames
     and pathnames.  Example: "The distribution is installed under the
     `/usr/local/' directory."

`c'
     Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to
     indicate character sequences.  Example: "To specify a wild card,
     use the `%' character."

_italic_
     Italic font is used for emphasis, _like this_.

*boldface*
     Boldface font is used for access privilege names (for example, "do
     not grant the *process* privilege lightly") and occasionally to
     convey *especially strong emphasis*.

When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular
program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.
For example, `shell>' indicates a command that you execute from your
login shell, and `mysql>' indicates a command that you execute from the
`mysql' client program:

     shell> type a shell command here
     mysql> type a mysql command here

Shell commands are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you are using a
`csh'-style shell, you may need to issue commands slightly differently.
For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a
command looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

     shell> VARNAME=value some_command

For `csh', you would execute the sequence like this:

     shell> setenv VARNAME value
     shell> some_command

Often, database, table, and column names must be substituted into
commands.  To indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual
uses `db_name', `tbl_name' and `col_name'.  For example, you might see
a statement like this:

     mysql> SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;

This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would
supply your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:

     mysql> SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;

SQL statements may be written in uppercase or lowercase.  When this
manual shows a SQL statement, uppercase is used for particular keywords
if those keywords are under discussion (to emphasize them) and
lowercase is used for the rest of the statement.  For example, you
might see the following in a discussion of the `SELECT' statement:

     mysql> SELECT count(*) FROM tbl_name;

On the other hand, in a discussion of the `COUNT()' function, the same
statement would be written like this:

     mysql> select COUNT(*) from tbl_name;

If no particular emphasis is intended, all keywords are written
uniformly in uppercase.

In syntax descriptions, square brackets (`[' and `]') are used to
indicate optional words or clauses:

     DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name

When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the
alternatives are separated by vertical bars (`|').  When one member
from a set of choices *may* be chosen, the alternatives are listed
within square brackets (`[' and `]'):

     TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)

When one member from a set of choices *must* be chosen, the
alternatives are listed within braces (`{' and `}'):

     {DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name {col_name | wild}

History of MySQL
----------------

We once started out with the intention of using `mSQL' to connect to our
tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some
testing we came to the conclusion that `mSQL' was not fast enough nor
flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to
our database but with almost the same API interface as `mSQL'.  This
API was chosen to ease porting of third-party code.

The derivation of the name MySQL is not perfectly clear.  Our base
directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the
prefix "my" for well over 10 years.  However, Monty's daughter (some
years younger) is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to
MySQL is still a mystery, even for us.

The Main Features of MySQL
--------------------------

The following list describes some of the important characteristics of
MySQL:

   * Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can
     easily use multiple CPUs if available.

   * C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Tcl APIs.  *Note
     Clients::.

   * Works on many different platforms.  *Note Which OS::.

   * Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes
     long, `FLOAT', `DOUBLE', `CHAR', `VARCHAR', `TEXT', `BLOB',
     `DATE', `TIME', `DATETIME', `TIMESTAMP', `YEAR', `SET', and `ENUM'
     types.  *Note Column types::.

   * Very fast joins using an optimized one-sweep multi-join.

   * Full operator and function support in the `SELECT' and `WHERE'
     parts of queries.  For example:

          mysql> SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name) FROM tbl_name
                     WHERE income/dependents > 10000 AND age > 30;

   * SQL functions are implemented through a highly optimized class
     library and should be as fast as possible!  Usually there isn't
     any memory allocation at all after query initialization.

   * Full support for SQL `GROUP BY' and `ORDER BY' clauses.  Support
     for group functions (`COUNT()', `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)', `AVG()',
     `STD()', `SUM()', `MAX()' and `MIN()').

   * Support for `LEFT OUTER JOIN' and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN' with ANSI SQL
     and ODBC syntax.

   * You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as
     of Version 3.22).

   * A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure,
     and allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because
     all password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.

   * ODBC (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) support for Win32 (with source).
     All ODBC 2.5 functions and many others.  For example, you can use
     MS Access to connect to your MySQL server.  *Note ODBC::.

   * Very fast B-tree disk tables with index compression.

   * Up to 32 indexes per table are allowed.  Each index may consist of
     1 to 16 columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index length is
     500 bytes (this may be changed when compiling MySQL).  An index
     may use a prefix of a `CHAR' or `VARCHAR' field.

   * Fixed-length and variable-length records.

   * In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.

   * Handles large databases.  We are using MySQL with some databases
     that contain 50,000,000 records and we know of users that uses
     MySQL with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows

   * All columns have default values.  You can use `INSERT' to insert a
     subset of a table's columns; those columns that are not explicitly
     given values are set to their default values.

   * Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.

   * Written in C and C++.  Tested with a broad range of different
     compilers.

   * A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.

   * No memory leaks.  MySQL has been tested with Purify, a commercial
     memory leakage detector.

   * Includes `myisamchk', a very fast utility for table checking,
     optimization, and repair.  All of the functionality of `myisamchk'
     is also available through the SQL interface as well.  *Note MySQL
     Database Administration::.

   * Full support for several different character sets, including
     ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), big5, ujis, and more.  For example, the
     Scandinavian characters `a*', `a"' and `o"' are allowed in table
     and column names.

   * All data are saved in the chosen character set.  All comparisons
     for normal string columns are case insensitive.

   * Sorting is done according to the chosen character set (the Swedish
     way by default).  It is possible to change this when the MySQL
     server is started up.  To see an example of very advanced sorting,
     look at the Czech sorting code.  MySQL supports many different
     character sets that can be specified at compile and run time.

   * Aliases on tables and columns are allowed as in the SQL92 standard.

   * `DELETE', `INSERT', `REPLACE', and `UPDATE' return the number of
     rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return the
     number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting
     to the server.

   * Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For
     example, `ABS' is a valid column name.  The only restriction is
     that for a function call, no spaces are allowed between the
     function name and the `(' that follows it.  *Note Reserved words::.

   * All MySQL programs can be invoked with the `--help' or `-?'
     options to obtain online assistance.

   * The server can provide error messages to clients in many languages.
     *Note Languages::.

   * Clients may connect to the MySQL server using TCP/IP Sockets, Unix
     Sockets (Unix), or Named Pipes (NT).

   * The MySQL-specific `SHOW' command can be used to retrieve
     information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The `EXPLAIN'
     command can be used to determine how the optimizer resolves a
     query.

How Stable Is MySQL?
--------------------

This section addresses the questions "How stable is MySQL?" and "Can I
depend on MySQL in this project?"  We will try to clarify some issues
and to answer some of the more important questions that seem to concern
many people.  This section has been put together from information
gathered from the mailing list (which is very active in reporting bugs).

At TcX, MySQL has worked without any problems in our projects since
mid-1996.  When MySQL was released to a wider public, we noticed that
there were some pieces of "untested code" that were quickly found by the
new users who made queries in a manner different than our own.  Each new
release has had fewer portability problems than the previous one (even
though each has had many new features).

Each release of MySQL has been usable, and there have been problems
only when users start to use code from the "gray zones."  Naturally,
outside users don't know what the gray zones are; this section attempts
to indicate those that are currently known.  The descriptions deal with
Version 3.23 of MySQL.  All known and reported bugs are fixed in the
latest version, with the exception of the bugs listed in the bugs
section, which are things that are design-related.  *Note Bugs::.

MySQL is written in multiple layers and different independent modules.
These modules are listed below with an indication of how well-tested
each of them is:

*The ISAM table handler -- Stable*
     This manages storage and retrieval of all data in MySQL Version
     3.22 and earlier.  In all MySQL releases there hasn't been a single
     (reported) bug in this code. The only known way to get a corrupted
     table is to kill the server in the middle of an update.  Even that
     is unlikely to destroy any data beyond rescue, because all data
     are flushed to disk between each query.  There hasn't been a
     single bug report about lost data because of bugs in MySQL.

*The MyISAM table handler -- Stable*
     This is new in MySQL Version 3.23.  It's largely based on the ISAM
     table code but has a lot of new and very useful features.

*The parser and lexical analyser -- Stable*
     There hasn't been a single reported bug in this system for a long
     time.

*The C client code -- Stable*
     No known problems.  In early Version 3.20 releases, there were
     some limitations in the send/receive buffer size.  As of Version
     3.21, the buffer size is now dynamic up to a default of 16M.

*Standard client programs -- Stable*
     These include `mysql', `mysqladmin', `mysqlshow', `mysqldump', and
     `mysqlimport'.

*Basic SQL -- Stable*
     The basic SQL function system and string classes and dynamic memory
     handling.  Not a single reported bug in this system.

*Query optimizer -- Stable*

*Range optimizer -- Stable*

*Join optimizer -- Stable*

*Locking -- Gamma*
     This is very system-dependent.  On some systems there are big
     problems using standard OS locking (`fcntl()').  In these cases,
     you should run the MySQL daemon with the `--skip-locking' flag.
     Problems are known to occur on some Linux systems, and on SunOS
     when using NFS-mounted file systems.

*Linux threads -- Stable*
     The major problem found has been with the `fcntl()' call, which is
     fixed by using the `--skip-locking' option to `mysqld'.  Some
     people have reported lockup problems with Version 0.5.
     LinuxThreads will need to be recompiled if you plan to use 1000+
     concurrent connections.  Although it is possible to run that many
     connections with the default LinuxThreads (however, you will never
     go above 1021), the default stack spacing of 2 MB makes the
     application unstable, and we have been able to reproduce a
     coredump after creating 1021 idle connections.  *Note Linux::.

*Solaris 2.5+ pthreads -- Stable*
     We use this for all our production work.

*MIT-pthreads (Other systems) -- Stable*
     There have been no reported bugs since Version 3.20.15 and no
     known bugs since Version 3.20.16.  On some systems, there is a
     "misfeature" where some operations are quite slow (a 1/20 second
     sleep is done between each query).  Of course, MIT-pthreads may
     slow down everything a bit, but index-based `SELECT' statements
     are usually done in one time frame so there shouldn't be a mutex
     locking/thread juggling.

*Other thread implementions -- Beta - Gamma*
     The ports to other systems are still very new and may have bugs,
     possibly in MySQL, but most often in the thread implementation
     itself.

*`LOAD DATA ...', `INSERT ... SELECT' -- Stable*
     Some people thought they had found bugs here, but these usually
     have turned out to be misunderstandings.  Please check the manual
     before reporting problems!

*`ALTER TABLE' -- Stable*
     Small changes in Version 3.22.12.

*DBD -- Stable*
     Now maintained by Jochen Wiedmann (<wiedmann@neckar-alb.de>).
     Thanks!

*`mysqlaccess' -- Stable*
     Written and maintained by Yves Carlier (<Yves.Carlier@rug.ac.be>).
     Thanks!

*`GRANT' -- Stable*
     Big changes made in MySQL Version 3.22.12.

**MyODBC* (uses ODBC SDK 2.5) -- Gamma*
     It seems to work well with some programs.

*Replication - Beta / Gamma*
     We are still working on replication, so don't expect this to be
     rock solid yet.  On the other hand, some MySQL users are already
     using this with good results.

*BDB Tables - Beta*
     The Berkeley DB code is very stable, but we are still improving
     the interface between MySQL and BDB tables, so it will take some
     time before this is as tested as the other table types.

*InnoDB Tables - Beta*
     This is a recent addition to `MySQL'. They appear to work good and
     can be used after some initial testing.

*Automatic recovery of MyISAM tables - Beta*
     This only affects the new code that checks if the table was closed
     properly on open and executes an automatic check/repair of the
     table if it wasn't.

*MERGE tables - Beta / Gamma*
     The usage of keys on `MERGE' tables is still not that tested.  The
     other part of the `MERGE' code is quite well tested.

*FULLTEXT - Beta*
     Text search seems to work, but is still not widely used.

MySQL AB provides e-mail support for paying customers, but the MySQL
mailing list usually provides answers to common questions.  Bugs are
usually fixed right away with a patch; for serious bugs, there is
almost always a new release.

How Big Can MySQL Tables Be?
----------------------------

MySQL Version 3.22 has a 4G limit on table size. With the new `MyISAM'
in MySQL Version 3.23 the maximum table size is pushed up to 8 million
terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes).

Note, however, that operating systems have their own file size limits.
Here are some examples:

*Operating System*                   *File Size Limit*
Linux-Intel 32 bit                   2G, 4G or more, depends on Linux
                                     version
Linux-Alpha                          8T (?)
Solaris 2.5.1                        2G (possible 4G with patch)
Solaris 2.6                          4G
Solaris 2.7 Intel                    4G
Solaris 2.7 ULTRA-SPARC              8T (?)

On Linux 2.2 you can get bigger tables than 2G by using the LFS patch
for the ext2 file system.  On Linux 2.4 there exists also patches for
ReiserFS to get support for big files.

This means that the table size for MySQL is normally limited by the
operating system.

By default, MySQL tables have a maximum size of about 4G.  You can
check the maximum table size for a table with the `SHOW TABLE STATUS'
command or with the `myisamchk -dv table_name'.  *Note SHOW::.

If you need bigger tables than 4G (and your operating system supports
this), you should set the `AVG_ROW_LENGTH' and `MAX_ROWS' parameter
when you create your table.  *Note CREATE TABLE::.  You can also set
these later with `ALTER TABLE'. *Note ALTER TABLE::.

If your big table is going to be read-only, you could use `myisampack'
to merge and compress many tables to one.  `myisampack' usually
compresses a table by at least 50%, so you can have, in effect, much
bigger tables.  *Note `myisampack': myisampack.

You can go around the operating system file limit for `MyISAM' data
files by using the `RAID' option. *Note CREATE TABLE::.

Another solution can be the included MERGE library, which allows you to
handle a collection of identical tables as one. *Note MERGE tables:
MERGE.

Year 2000 Compliance
--------------------

MySQL itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance:

   * MySQL uses Unix time functions and has no problems with dates
     until `2069'; all 2-digit years are regarded to be in the range
     `1970' to `2069', which means that if you store `01' in a `year'
     column, MySQL treats it as `2001'.

   * All MySQL date functions are stored in one file `sql/time.cc' and
     coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.

   * In MySQL Version 3.22 and later, the new `YEAR' column type can
     store years `0' and `1901' to `2155' in 1 byte and display them
     using 2 or 4 digits.

You may run into problems with applications that use MySQL in a way
that is not Y2K-safe.  For example, many old applications store or
manipulate years using 2-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than
4-digit values.  This problem may be compounded by applications that use
values such as `00' or `99' as "missing" value indicators.

Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix, because different
applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may
use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.

Here is a simple demonstration illustrating that MySQL doesn't have any
problems with dates until the year 2030:

     mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS y2k;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
     
     mysql> CREATE TABLE y2k (date date, date_time datetime, time_stamp timestamp);
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     mysql> INSERT INTO y2k VALUES
         -> ("1998-12-31","1998-12-31 23:59:59",19981231235959),
         -> ("1999-01-01","1999-01-01 00:00:00",19990101000000),
         -> ("1999-09-09","1999-09-09 23:59:59",19990909235959),
         -> ("2000-01-01","2000-01-01 00:00:00",20000101000000),

         -> ("2050-01-01","2050-01-01 00:00:00",20500101000000);
     Query OK, 13 rows affected (0.01 sec)
     Records: 13  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

     13 rows in set (0.00 sec)

This shows that the `DATE' and `DATETIME' types will not give any
problems with future dates (they handle dates until the year 9999).

The `TIMESTAMP' type, which is used to store the current time, has a
range up to only `2030-01-01'.  `TIMESTAMP' has a range of `1970' to
`2030' on 32-bit machines (signed value).  On 64-bit machines it
handles times up to `2106' (unsigned value).

Even though MySQL is Y2K-compliant, it is your responsibility to
provide unambiguous input.  See *Note Y2K issues:: for MySQL's rules
for dealing with ambiguous date input data (data containing 2-digit year
values).

Foreword by Michael "Monty" Widenius, MySQL Moderator.
In _MySQL_, Paul DuBois provides you with a comprehensive guide to one
of the most popular relational database systems.  Paul has contributed
to the online documentation for MySQL and is an active member of the
MySQL community.  The principal MySQL developer, Monty Widenius, and a
network of his fellow developers reviewed the manuscript, and provided
Paul with the kind of insight no one else could supply.
Instead of merely giving you a general overview of MySQL, Paul teaches
you how to make the most of its capabilities.  Through two sample
database applications that run throughout the book, he gives you
solutions to problems you're sure to face.  He helps you integrate
MySQL efficiently with third-party tools, such as PHP and Perl,
enabling you to generate dynamic Web pages through database queries.
He teaches you to write programs that access MySQL databases, and also
provides a comprehensive set of references to column types, operators,
functions, SQL syntax, MySQL programming, C API, Perl `DBI', and PHP
API.  _MySQL_ simply gives you the kind of information you won't find
anywhere else.
If you use MySQL, this book provides you with:
   * An introduction to MySQL and SQL.

   * Coverage of MySQL's data types and how to use them.

   * Thorough treatment of how to write client programs in C.

   * A guide to using the Perl `DBI' and PHP APIs for developing
     command-line and Web-based applications.

   * Tips on administrative issues such as user accounts, backup, crash
     recovery, and security.

   * Help in choosing an ISP for MySQL access.

   * A comprehensive reference for MySQL's data types, operators,
     functions, and SQL statements and utilities.

   * Complete reference guides for MySQL's C API, the Perl `DBI' API,
     and PHP's MySQL-related functions.

implementing both MySQL and PHP.  These advantages are detailed through
the provision of both statistics and several case studies.  A practical
web application is developed throughout the book, providing you with
the tools necessary to implement a functional online database.  Each
function is developed separately, allowing you the choice to
incorporate only those parts that you would like to implement.
Programming concepts of the PHP language are highlighted, including
functions which tie MySQL support into a PHP script and advanced topics
regarding table manipulation.

_C++ For Real Programmers_ bridges the gap between C++ as described in
beginner and intermediate-level books and C++ as it is practiced by
experts.  Numerous valuable techniques are described, organized into
three simple themes: indirection, class hierarchies, and memory
management.  It also provides in-depth coverage of template creation,
exception handling, pointers and optimization techniques.  The focus of
the book is on ANSI C++ and, as such, is compiler independent.

_C++ For Real Programmers_ is a revision of _Secrets of the C++
Masters_ and includes a new appendix comparing C++ with Java.  The book
comes with a 3.5" disk for Windows with source code.

The MySQL Mailing Lists
.......................

To subscribe to the main MySQL mailing list, send a message to the
electronic mail address <mysql-subscribe@lists.mysql.com>.

To unsubscribe from the main MySQL mailing list, send a message to the
electronic mail address <mysql-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com>.

Only the address to which you send your messages is significant.  The
subject line and the body of the message are ignored.

If your reply address is not valid, you can specify your address
explicitly.  Adding a hyphen to the subscribe or unsubscribe command
word, followed by your address with the `@' character in your address
replaced by a `='.  For example, to subscribe `your_name@host.domain',
send a message to
`mysql-subscribe-your_name=host.domain@lists.mysql.com'.

Mail to <mysql-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> or
<mysql-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com> is handled automatically by the
ezmlm mailing list processor.  Information about ezmlm is available at
The ezmlm Website (http://www.ezmlm.org).

To post a message to the list itself, send your message to
`mysql@lists.mysql.com'.  However, please _do not_ send mail about
subscribing or unsubscribing to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>, because any
mail sent to that address is distributed automatically to thousands of
other users.

Your local site may have many subscribers to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.
If so, it may have a local mailing list, so that messages sent from
`lists.mysql.com' to your site are propagated to the local list.  In
such cases, please contact your system administrator to be added to or
dropped from the local MySQL list.

If you wish to have traffic for a mailing list go to a separate mailbox
in your mail program, set up a filter based on the message headers.
You can use either the `List-ID:' or `Delivered-To:' headers to identify
list messages.

The following MySQL mailing lists exist:

`<announce-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> announce'
     This is for announcement of new versions of MySQL and related
     programs.  This is a low volume list all MySQL users should
     subscribe to.

`<mysql-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> mysql'
     The main list for general MySQL discussion.  Please note that some
     topics are better discussed on the more-specialized lists.  If you
     post to the wrong list, you may not get an answer!

`<mysql-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> mysql-digest'
     The `mysql' list in digest form.  That means you get all individual
     messages, sent as one large mail message once a day.

`<bugs-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> bugs'
     On this list you should only post a full, repeatable bug report
     using the `mysqlbug' script (if you are running on Windows, you
     should include a description of the operating system and the MySQL
     version).  Preferably, you should test the problem using the
     latest stable or development version of MySQL before posting!
     Anyone should be able to repeat the bug by just using `mysql test
     < script' on the included test case.  All bugs posted on this list
     will be corrected or documented in the next MySQL release!  If
     there are only small code changes involved, we will also post a
     patch that fixes the problem.

`<bugs-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> bugs-digest'
     The `bugs' list in digest form.

`<internals-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> internals'
     A list for people who work on the MySQL code.  On this list one
     can also discuss MySQL development and post patches.

`<internals-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> internals-digest'
     A digest version of the `internals' list.

`<java-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> java'
     Discussion about MySQL and Java.  Mostly about the JDBC drivers.

`<java-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> java-digest'
     A digest version of the `java' list.

`<win32-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> win32'
     All things concerning MySQL on Microsoft operating systems such as
     Win95, Win98, NT, and Win2000.

`<win32-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> win32-digest'
     A digest version of the `win32' list.

`<myodbc-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> myodbc'
     All things about connecting to MySQL with ODBC.

`<myodbc-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> myodbc-digest'
     A digest version of the `myodbc' list.

`<plusplus-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> plusplus'
     All things concerning programming with the C++ API to MySQL.

`<plusplus-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> plusplus-digest'
     A digest version of the `plusplus' list.

`<msql-mysql-modules-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> msql-mysql-modules'
     A list about the Perl support in MySQL. msql-mysql-modules

`<msql-mysql-modules-digest-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> msql-mysql-modules-digest'
     A digest version of the `msql-mysql-modules' list.

You subscribe or unsubscribe to all lists in the same way as described
above.  In your subscribe or unsubscribe message, just put the
appropriate mailing list name rather than `mysql'.  For example, to
subscribe to or unsubscribe from the `myodbc' list, send a message to
<myodbc-subscribe@lists.mysql.com> or
<myodbc-unsubscribe@lists.mysql.com>.

If you can't get an answer for your questions from the mailing list, one
option is to pay for support from MySQL AB, which will put you in
direct contact with MySQL developers. *Note Support::.

The following table shows some MySQL mailing in other languages than
English.  Note that these are not operated by MySQL AB, so we can't
guarantee the quality on these.

`<mysql-france-subscribe@yahoogroups.com> A French mailing list'

`<list@tinc.net> A Korean mailing list'
     Email `subscribe mysql your@email.address' to this list.

`<mysql-de-request@lists.4t2.com> A German mailing list'
     Email `subscribe mysql-de your@email.address' to this list.  You
     can find information about this mailing list at
     `http://www.4t2.com/mysql'.

`<mysql-br-request@listas.linkway.com.br> A Portugese mailing list'
     Email `subscribe mysql-br your@email.address' to this list.

Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs
..................................

Before posting a bug report or question, please do the following:

   * Start by searching the MySQL online manual at:
     `http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php'
     We try to keep the manual up to date by updating it frequently with
     solutions to newly found problems!

   * Search the MySQL mailing list archives:
     `http://www.mysql.com/documentation/'
   * You can also use `http://www.mysql.com/search.html' to search all
     the Web pages (including the manual) that are located at
     `http://www.mysql.com/'.

If you can't find an answer in the manual or the archives, check with
your local MySQL expert.  If you still can't find an answer to your
question, go ahead and read the next section about how to send mail to
<mysql@lists.mysql.com>.

How to Report Bugs or Problems
..............................

Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first
time saves time for us and for you.  A good bug report containing a full
test case for the bug will make it very likely that we will fix it in
the next release.  This section will help you write your report
correctly so that you don't waste your time doing things that may not
help us much or at all.

We encourage everyone to use the `mysqlbug' script to generate a bug
report (or a report about any problem), if possible.  `mysqlbug' can be
found in the `scripts' directory in the source distribution, or, for a
binary distribution, in the `bin' directory under your MySQL
installation directory.  If you are unable to use `mysqlbug', you should
still include all the necessary information listed in this section.

The `mysqlbug' script helps you generate a report by determining much
of the following information automatically, but if something important
is missing, please include it with your message!  Please read this
section carefully and make sure that all the information described here
is included in your report.

The normal place to report bugs and problems is
<mysql@lists.mysql.com>.  If you can make a test case that clearly
demonstrates the bug, you should post it to the <bugs@lists.mysql.com>
list.  Note that on this list you should only post a full, repeatable
bug report using the `mysqlbug' script.  If you are running on Windows,
you should include a description of the operating system and the MySQL
version.  Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest
stable or development version of MySQL before posting!  Anyone should
be able to repeat the bug by just using "`mysql test < script'" on the
included test case or run the shell or perl script that is included in
the bug report.  All bugs posted on the `bugs' list will be corrected
or documented in the next MySQL release!  If there are only small code
changes involved to correct this problem, we will also post a patch
that fixes the problem.

Remember that it is possible to respond to a message containing too much
information, but not to one containing too little.  Often people omit
facts because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume
that some details don't matter.  A good principle is: if you are in
doubt about stating something, state it!  It is a thousand times faster
and less troublesome to write a couple of lines more in your report
than to be forced to ask again and wait for the answer because you
didn't include enough information the first time.

The most common errors are that people don't indicate the version
number of the MySQL distribution they are using, or don't indicate what
platform they have MySQL installed on (including the platform version
number).  This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of
100 the bug report is useless without it!  Very often we get questions
like, "Why doesn't this work for me?" then we find that the feature
requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug
described in a report has been fixed already in newer MySQL versions.
Sometimes the error is platform dependent; in such cases, it is next to
impossible to fix anything without knowing the operating system and the
version number of the platform.

Remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is
related to the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think
the problem is MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all
the time and become better version by version.  To determine whether or
not your problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what
compiler is used.  Note that every compiling problem should be regarded
as a bug report and reported accordingly.

It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included
in the bug report.  That is, a good example of all the things you did
that led to the problem and the problem itself exactly described.  The
best reports are those that include a full example showing how to
reproduce the bug or problem.  *Note Reproduceable test case::.

If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include
the message in your report!  If we try to search for something from the
archives using programs, it is better that the error message reported
exactly matches the one that the program produces.  (Even the case
should be observed!)  You should never try to remember what the error
message was; instead, copy and paste the entire message into your
report!

If you have a problem with MyODBC, you should try to generate a MyODBC
trace file.  *Note MyODBC bug report::.

Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will
do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples
using the `mysql' command line tool, you should therefore use the
`--vertical' option (or the `\G' statement terminator) for output that
would exceed the available width for such a display (for example, with
the `EXPLAIN SELECT' statement; see the example below).

Please include the following information in your report:

   * The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
     example, MySQL Version 3.22.22). You can find out which version you
     are running by executing `mysqladmin version'.  `mysqladmin' can be
     found in the `bin' directory under your MySQL installation
     directory.

   * The manufacturer and model of the machine you are working on.

   * The operating system name and version.  For most operating
     systems, you can get this information by executing the Unix
     command `uname -a'.

   * Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If
     in doubt, include these values.

   * If you are using a source distribution of MySQL, the name and
     version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a
     binary distribution, the distribution name is needed.

   * If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error
     message(s) and also a few lines of context around the offending
     code in the file where the error occurred.

   * If `mysqld' died, you should also report the query that crashed
     `mysqld'.  You can usually find this out by running `mysqld' with
     logging enabled.  *Note Using log files::.

   * If any database table is related to the problem, include the
     output from `mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ...'.
     This is very easy to do and is a powerful way to get information
     about any table in a database that will help us create a situation
     matching the one you have.

   * For speed-related bugs or problems with `SELECT' statements, you
     should always include the output of `EXPLAIN SELECT ...', and at
     least the number of rows that the `SELECT' statement produces.
     The more information you give about your situation, the more
     likely it is that someone can help you!  For example, the
     following is an example of a very good bug report (it should of
     course be posted with the `mysqlbug' script):

     Example run using the `mysql' command line tool (note the use of
     the `\G' statement terminator for statements whose output width
     would otherwise exceed that of an 80-column display device):

          mysql> SHOW VARIABLES;
          mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
                 <output from SHOW COLUMNS>
          mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
                 <output from EXPLAIN>
          mysql> FLUSH STATUS;
          mysql> SELECT ...;
                 <A short version of the output from SELECT,
                 including the time taken to run the query>
          mysql> SHOW STATUS;
                 <output from SHOW STATUS>

   * If a bug or problem occurs while running *mysqld*, try to provide
     an input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script
     should include any necessary source files.  The more closely the
     script can reproduce your situation, the better.  If you can make
     a repeatable test case, you should post this to
     <bugs@lists.mysql.com> for a high priority treatment!

     If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the
     output from `mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist' in
     your mail to provide some information of how your system is
     performing!

   * If you can't produce a test case in a few rows, or if the test
     table is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10
     rows), you should dump your tables using `mysqldump' and create a
     `README' file that describes your problem.

     Create a compressed archive of your files using `tar' and `gzip'
     or `zip', and use `ftp' to transfer the archive to
     `ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/'.  Then send a short
     description of the problem to <bugs@lists.mysql.com>.

   * If you think that MySQL produces a strange result from a query,
     include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the
     result should be, and an account describing the basis for your
     opinion.

   * When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the
     variable names, table names, etc., that exist in your actual
     situation than to come up with new names.  The problem could be
     related to the name of a variable or table!  These cases are rare,
     perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry.  After all, it
     should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your
     actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case
     you have data you don't want to show to others, you can use `ftp'
     to transfer it to `ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/'.  If
     the data are really top secret and you don't want to show them
     even to us, then go ahead and provide an example using other
     names, but please regard this as the last choice.

   * Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if
     possible.  For example, indicate the options that you use when you
     start the `mysqld' daemon and that you use to run any MySQL client
     programs.  The options to programs like `mysqld' and `mysql', and
     to the `configure' script, are often keys to answers and are very
     relevant!  It is never a bad idea to include them anyway!  If you
     use any modules, such as Perl or PHP, please include the version
     number(s) of those as well.

   * If your question is related to the privilege system, please
     include the output of `mysqlaccess', the output of `mysqladmin
     reload', and all the error messages you get when trying to
     connect!  When you test your privileges, you should first run
     `mysqlaccess'.  After this, execute `mysqladmin reload version'
     and try to connect with the program that gives you trouble.
     `mysqlaccess' can be found in the `bin' directory under your MySQL
     installation directory.

   * If you have a patch for a bug, that is good, but don't assume the
     patch is all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide
     some necessary information, such as test cases showing the bug
     that your patch fixes.  We might find problems with your patch or
     we might not understand it at all; if so, we can't use it.

     If we can't verify exactly what the patch is meant for, we won't
     use it.  Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will
     handle all the situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline
     case (even a rare one) where the patch won't work, it may be
     useless.

   * Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends
     on, are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things
     without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a
     bug.

   * Indicate in your mail message that you have checked the reference
     manual and mail archive so others know that you have tried to
     solve the problem yourself.

   * If you get a `parse error', please check your syntax closely!  If
     you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that
     your current version of MySQL doesn't support the query you are
     using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at
     `http://www.mysql.com/documentation/manual.php' doesn't cover the
     syntax you are using, MySQL doesn't support your query.  In this
     case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or
     e-mail <mysql-licensing@mysql.com> and ask for an offer to
     implement it!

     If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an
     older version of MySQL, you should check the MySQL change history
     to see when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have
     the option of upgrading to a newer version of MySQL.  *Note News::.

   * If you have a problem such that your data appears corrupt or you
     get errors when you access some particular table, you should first
     check and then try repairing your tables with `myisamchk' or
     `CHECK TABLE' and `REPAIR TABLE'.  *Note MySQL Database
     Administration::.

   * If you often get corrupted tables you should try to find out when
     and why this happens!  In this case, the
     `mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err' file may contain some
     information about what happened.  *Note Error log::.  Please
     include any relevant information from this file in your bug
     report!  Normally `mysqld' should *NEVER* crash a table if nothing
     killed it in the middle of an update!  If you can find the cause
     of `mysqld' dying, it's much easier for us to provide you with a
     fix for the problem!  *Note What is crashing::.

   * If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL
     and check whether or not it solves your problem.  All versions of
     MySQL are thoroughly tested and should work without problems!  We
     believe in making everything as backward compatible as possible,
     and you should be able to switch MySQL versions in minutes!  *Note
     Which version::.

If you are a support customer, please cross-post the bug report to
<mysql-support@mysql.com> for higher priority treatment, as well as to
the appropriate mailing list to see if someone else has experienced (and
perhaps solved) the problem.

For information on reporting bugs in *MyODBC*, see *Note ODBC
Problems::.

For solutions to some common problems, see *Note Problems::.

When answers are sent to you individually and not to the mailing list,
it is considered good etiquette to summarize the answers and send the
summary to the mailing list so that others may have the benefit of
responses you received that helped you solve your problem!

MySQL Licensing Policy
----------------------

The formal terms of the GPL license can be found at *Note GPL license::.
Basically, our licensing policy and interpretation of the GPL is as
follows:

Note that older versions of MySQL are still using a more strict license
(http://www.mysql.com/support/arrangements/mypl.html).  See the
documentation for that version for more information. If you need a
commercial MySQL license, because the GPL license doesn't suit your
application, you can buy one at `https://order.mysql.com/'.

For normal internal use, MySQL costs nothing.  You do not have to pay
us if you do not want to.

A license is required if:

   - You link a program, that is not free software, with code from the
     MySQL server or clients that has the GPL copyright. This happens
     for example when you use MySQL as an embedded server in your
     applications or when you add not free extensions to the MySQL
     server.  In this case your application/code would also become GPL
     through the GPL license that acts as a virus.  By licensing MySQL
     server from MySQL AB under a commercial license you will avoid
     this problem.  See `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html'.

   - You have a commercial application that ONLY works with MySQL and
     ships the application with the MySQL server.  This is because we
     view this as linking even if it is done over the network.

   - You have a distribution of MySQL and you don't provide the source
     code for your copy of the MySQL server, as defined in the GPL
     license.

A license is *NOT* required if:

   - You do not need a license to include the client code in commercial
     programs.  The client part of MySQL licensed with the LGPL `GNU
     Library General Public License'.  The `mysql' command-line client
     includes code from the `readline' library that is under the `GPL'.

   - If your use of MySQL does not require a license, but you like
     MySQL and want to encourage further development, you are certainly
     welcome to purchase a license or MySQL support anyway.

   - If you use MySQL in a commercial context such that you profit by
     its use, we ask that you further the development of MySQL by
     purchasing some level of support.  We feel that if MySQL helps
     your business, it is reasonable to ask that you help MySQL.
     (Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only
     using for free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're
     asking us to provide free support, too.)

For circumstances under which a MySQL license is required, you need a
license per machine that runs the `mysqld' server.  However, a
multiple-CPU machine counts as a single machine, and there is no
restriction on the number of MySQL servers that run on one machine, or
on the number of clients concurrently connected to a server running on
that machine!

If you have any questions as to whether or not a license is required for
your particular use of MySQL, please read this again and then contact
us.  *Note Contact information::.

If you require a MySQL license, the easiest way to pay for it is to use
the license form on MySQL's secure server at

Copyrights Used by MySQL
------------------------

* Menu:

* Copyright changes::           Possible future copyright changes

There are several different copyrights on the MySQL distribution:

  1. The MySQL-specific source needed to build the `mysqlclient'
     library is licensed under the `LGPL' and programs in the `client'
     directory is GPL. Each file has a header that shows which
     copyright is used for that file.

  2. The client library and the (GNU `getopt') library are covered by
     the "GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE."  *Note LGPL license::.

  3. Some parts of the source (the `regexp' library) are covered by a
     Berkeley-style copyright.

  4. All the source in the server and the (GNU `readline') library is
     covered by the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE."  *Note GPL license::.
     This is also available as the file `COPYING' in the distributions.


One goal is that the SQL client library should be free enough that it is
possible to add MySQL support into commercial products without a
license.  For this reason, we chose the LGPL license for the client
code.

This means that you can use MySQL for free with any program that uses
any of the free software licenses.  MySQL is also free for any end user
for his own or company usage.

However, if you use MySQL for something important to you, you may want
to help secure its development by purchasing licenses or a support
contract.  *Note Support::.

Example Licensing Situations
----------------------------

* Menu:

* Products that use MySQL::     Selling products that use MySQL
* ISP::                         ISP MySQL services
* Web server::                  Running a web server using MySQL.

This section describes some situations illustrating whether or not you
must license the MySQL server.  Generally these examples involve
providing MySQL as an integral part of a product.

Note that a single MySQL license covers any number of CPUs and `mysqld'
servers on a machine!  There is no artificial limit on the number of
clients that connect to the server in any way.

Selling Products that use MySQL
...............................

To determine whether or not you need a MySQL license when selling your
application, you should ask whether the proper functioning of your
application is dependent on the use of MySQL and whether you include
the MySQL server with your product.  There are several cases to
consider:

   * Does your application require MySQL to function properly?

   * If your product requires MySQL, you need a license for any machine
     that runs the `mysqld' server.  For example, if you've designed
     your application around MySQL, then you've really made a
     commercial product that requires the engine, so you need a license.

   * If your application does not require MySQL, you do not need to
     obtain a license.  For example, if using MySQL just adds some new
     optional features to your product (such as adding logging to a
     database if MySQL is used rather than logging to a text file), it
     should fall within normal use, and a license would not be required.

   * In other words, you need a license if you sell a product designed
     specifically for use with MySQL or that requires the MySQL server
     to function at all.  This is true whether or not you provide MySQL
     for your client as part of your product distribution.

   * It also depends on what you're doing for the client.  Do you plan
     to provide your client with detailed instructions on installing
     MySQL with your software?  Then your product may be contingent on
     the use of MySQL; if so, you need to buy a license.  If you are
     simply tying into a database that you expect already to have been
     installed by the time your software is purchased, then you probably
     don't need a license.

ISP MySQL Services
..................

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often host MySQL servers for their
customers.  With the GPL license this does not require a license.

On the other hand, we do encourage people to use ISPs that have MySQL
support, as this will give them the confidence that if they have some
problem with their MySQL installation, their ISP will be able to solve
the problem for them (in some cases with the help from the MySQL
development team).

All ISPs that want to keep themselves up-to-date should subscribe to
our `announce' mailing list so that they can be aware of fatal issues
that may be relevant for their MySQL installations.

Note that if the ISP doesn't have a license for MySQL, it should give
its customers at least read access to the source of the MySQL
installation so that its customer can verify that it is patched
correctly.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Web server,  Prev: ISP,  Up: Licensing examples

Running a Web Server Using MySQL
................................

If you use MySQL in conjunction with a Web server on Unix, you don't
have to pay for a license.

This is true even if you run a commercial Web server that uses MySQL,
because you are not selling an embedded MySQL version yourself.
However, in this case we would like you to purchase MySQL support,
because MySQL is helping your enterprise.

visit `https://order.mysql.com/'.

If you pay by credit card, the currency is EURO (European Union Euro)
so the prices will differ slightly.

For high volume (OEM) purchases, please contact <sales@mysql.com>.

For OEM purchases, you must act as the middle-man for eventual problems
or extension requests from your users.  We also require that OEM
customers have at least an extended e-mail support contract.  Note that
OEM licenses only apply for products where the user doesn't have direct
access to the MySQL server (embedded system).  In other words, the
MySQL server should only be used with the application that was supplied
you.

If you have a low-margin, high-volume product, you can always talk to us
about other terms (for example, a percent of the sale price).  If you
do, please be informative about your product, pricing, market, and any
other information that may be relevant.

A full-price license is not a support agreement and includes very
minimal support.  This means that we try to answer any relevant
questions.  If the answer is in the documentation, we will direct you
to the appropriate section.  If you have not purchased a license or
support, we probably will not answer at all.

If you discover what we consider a real bug, we are likely to fix it in
any case.  But if you pay for support we will notify you about the fix
status instead of just fixing it in a later release.

More comprehensive support is sold separately.  Descriptions of what
each level of support includes are given in *Note Support::.  Costs for
the various types of commercial support are shown below.  Support level
prices are in EURO (European Union Euro).  One EURO is about 1.06 USD.

*Type of support*                    *Cost per year*

You may upgrade from any lower level of support to a higher level of
support for the difference in price between the two support levels.

We do also provide telephone support (mostly emergency support but also
24/7 support).  This support option doesn't however have a fixed price
but is negotiated for case to case.  If you are interested in this
option you can email <sales@mysql.com> and tell us about your needs.

Note that as our sales staff is very busy, it may take some time until
your request is handled.  Our support staff does however always answer
promptly to support questions!

Basic E-mail Support
....................

Basic e-mail support is a very inexpensive support option and should be
thought of more as a way to support our development of MySQL than as a
real support option.  We at MySQL do give a lot of free support in all
the different MySQL lists, and the money we get from basic e-mail
support is largely used to make this possible.

At this support level, the MySQL mailing lists are the preferred means
of communication.  Questions normally should be mailed to the primary
mailing list (<mysql@lists.mysql.com>) or one of the other regular
lists (for example, <win32@lists.mysql.com> for Windows-related MySQL
questions), as someone else already may have experienced and solved the
problem you have.  *Note Asking questions::.

However, by purchasing basic e-mail support, you also have access to the
support address <mysql-support@mysql.com>, which is not available as
part of the minimal support that you get by purchasing a MySQL license.
This means that for especially critical questions, you can cross-post
your message to <mysql-support@mysql.com>.  (If the message contains
sensitive data, you should post only to <mysql-support@mysql.com>.)

*REMEMBER!* to ALWAYS include your registration number and expiration
date when you send a message to <mysql-support@mysql.com>.

Note that if you have encountered a critical, repeatable bug, and follow
the rules outlined in the manual section of how to report bugs and send
it to <bugs@lists.mysql.com>, we promise to try to fix this as soon as
possible, regardless of your support level!  *Note Bug reports::.

Basic e-mail support includes the following types of service:

   * If your question is already answered in the manual, we will inform
     you of the correct section in which you can find the answer.  If
     the answer is not in the manual, we will point you in the right
     direction to solve your problem.

   * We guarantee a timely answer for your e-mail messages.  We can't
     guarantee that we can solve any problem, but at least you will
     receive an answer if we can contact you by e-mail.

   * We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL from a
     binary distribution on supported platforms.  This level of support
     does not cover installing MySQL from a source distribution.
     Supported platforms are those for which MySQL is known to work.
     *Note Which OS::.

   * We will help you with bugs and missing features.  Any bugs that
     are found are fixed for the next MySQL release.  If the bug is
     critical for you, we will mail you a patch for it as soon the bug
     is fixed.  Critical bugs always have the highest priority for us,
     and we ensure that they are fixed as soon as possible.

   * Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will be
     taken into consideration.  By taking email support you have already
     helped the further development of MySQL.  If you want to have more
     input, upgrade to a higher level of support.

   * If you want us to help optimize your system, you must upgrade to a
     higher level of support.

Extended E-mail Support
.......................

Extended e-mail support includes everything in basic e-mail support with
these additions:

   * Your e-mail will be dealt with before mail from basic e-mail
     support users and non-registered users.

   * Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will receive
     strong consideration.  Simple extensions that suit the basic goals
     of MySQL are implemented in a matter of days.  By taking extended
     e-mail support you have already helped the further development of
     MySQL.

   * Typical situations that are covered by extended e-mail support are:

        - We will answer and (within reason) solve questions that
          relate to possible bugs in MySQL.  As soon as the bug is
          found and corrected, we will mail a patch for it.

        - We will help with unexpected problems when you install MySQL
          from a source or binary distribution on supported platforms.

        - We will answer questions about missing features and offer
          hints how to work around them.

        - We will provide hints on optimizing `mysqld' for your
          situation.

   * You are allowed to influence the priority of items on the MySQL
     TODO List.  *Note TODO::.  This will ensure that the features you
     really need will be implemented sooner than they might be
     otherwise.

Login support includes everything in extended e-mail support with these
additions:

   * Your e-mail will be dealt with even before e-mail from extended
     e-mail support users.

   * Your suggestions for the further development of MySQL will be
     taken into very high consideration.  Realistic extensions that can
     be implemented in a couple of hours and that suit the basic goals
     of MySQL will be implemented as soon as possible.

   * If you have a very specific problem, we can try to log in on your
     system to solve the problem "in place."

   * Like any database vendor, we can't guarantee that we can rescue
     any data from crashed tables, but if the worst happens, we will
     help you rescue as much as possible.  MySQL has proven itself very
     reliable, but anything is possible due to circumstances beyond our
     control (for example, if your system crashes or someone kills the
     server by executing a `kill -9' command).

   * We will provide hints on optimizing your system and your queries.

   * You are allowed to call a MySQL developer (in moderation) and
     discuss your MySQL-related problems.  This option is however only
     to be used as a last result during an emergency after we have
     failed to grasp the total problem with email.  To make efficient
     use of our time we need to first get all facts about the problem,
     before talking on phone, to be able to work as efficiently as
     possible on solving the problem.

Extended login support includes everything in login support with these
additions:

   * Your e-mail has the highest possible priority.

   * We will actively examine your system and help you optimize it and
     your queries.  We may also optimize and/or extend MySQL to better
     suit your needs.

   * You may also request special extensions just for you.  For example:
          mysql> select MY_FUNC(col1,col2) from table;

   * We will provide a binary distribution of all important MySQL
     releases for your system, as long as we can get an account on a
     similar system.  In the worst case, we may require access to your
     system to be able to create a binary distribution.

   * If you can provide accommodations and pay for traveler fares, you
     can even get a MySQL developer to visit you and offer you help with
     your troubles.  Extended login support entitles you to one personal
     encounter per year, but we are always very flexible towards our
     customers!  If the visit takes 16 hours or more, the first 8 hours
     is without charge.  For the hours above 8 hours, you will be
     charged with a rate that is at least 20 % less than our standard
     rates.

handlers you would like to have support for.

We at `MySQL AB' will help you create a proper bug report for the table
handler and submit it to the developers for the specific table handler.
We will also do our best to ensure that you will get a timely answer
or solution from the developers of the table handler.

Even if we are quite confident that we can solve most problems within a
timely manner, we can't guarantee a quick solution for any problems you
can get with the different table handlers.  We will however do our best
to help you get the problem solved.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Extensions to ANSI,  Next: Differences from ANSI,  Prev: Compatibility,  Up: Compatibility

MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92
------------------------------

MySQL includes some extensions that you probably will not find in other
SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments of
the form `/*! ... */'.  In this case, MySQL will parse and execute the
code within the comment as it would any other MySQL statement, but
other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

     SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...

If you add a version number after the `'!'', the syntax will only be
executed if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the used
version number:

     CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE (a int);

The above means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, then MySQL
will use the `TEMPORARY' keyword.

MySQL extensions are listed below:

   * The field types `MEDIUMINT', `SET', `ENUM', and the different
     `BLOB' and `TEXT' types.

   * The field attributes `AUTO_INCREMENT', `BINARY', `NULL',
     `UNSIGNED', and `ZEROFILL'.

   * All string comparisons are case insensitive by default, with sort
     ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1
     Latin1 by default).  If you don't like this, you should declare
     your columns with the `BINARY' attribute or use the `BINARY' cast,
     which causes comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order
     used on the MySQL server host.

   * MySQL maps each database to a directory under the MySQL data
     directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the
     database directory.

     This has a few implications:

        - Database names and table names are case sensitive in MySQL on
          operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like
          most Unix systems). *Note Name case sensitivity::.

        - Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with
          a digit (but may not consist solely of digits).

        - You can use standard system commands to backup, rename, move,
          delete, and copy tables.  For example, to rename a table,
          rename the `.MYD', `.MYI', and `.frm' files to which the
          table corresponds.

   * In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases
     with the `db_name.tbl_name' syntax.  Some SQL servers provide the
     same functionality but call this `User space'.  MySQL doesn't
     support tablespaces as in: `create table ralph.my_table...IN
     my_tablespace'.

   * `LIKE' is allowed on numeric columns.

   * Use of `INTO OUTFILE' and `STRAIGHT_JOIN' in a `SELECT' statement.
     *Note `SELECT': SELECT.

   * The `SQL_SMALL_RESULT' option in a `SELECT' statement.

   * `EXPLAIN SELECT' to get a description on how tables are joined.

   * Use of index names, indexes on a prefix of a field, and use of
     `INDEX' or `KEY' in a `CREATE TABLE' statement. *Note `CREATE
     TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

   * Use of `TEMPORARY' or `IF NOT EXISTS' with `CREATE TABLE'.

   * Use of `COUNT(DISTINCT list)' where 'list' is more than one
     element.

   * Use of `CHANGE col_name', `DROP col_name', or `DROP INDEX',
     `IGNORE' or `RENAME' in an `ALTER TABLE' statement. *Note `ALTER
     TABLE': ALTER TABLE.

   * Use of `RENAME TABLE'. *Note `RENAME TABLE': RENAME TABLE.

   * Use of multiple `ADD', `ALTER', `DROP', or `CHANGE' clauses in an
     `ALTER TABLE' statement.

   * Use of `DROP TABLE' with the keywords `IF EXISTS'.

   * You can drop multiple tables with a single `DROP TABLE' statement.

   * The `LIMIT' clause of the `DELETE' statement.

   * The `DELAYED' clause of the `INSERT' and `REPLACE' statements.

   * The `LOW_PRIORITY' clause of the `INSERT', `REPLACE', `DELETE',
     and `UPDATE' statements.

   * Use of `LOAD DATA INFILE'. In many cases, this syntax is
     compatible with Oracle's `LOAD DATA INFILE'. *Note `LOAD DATA':
     LOAD DATA.

   * The `ANALYZE TABLE', `CHECK TABLE', `OPTIMIZE TABLE', and `REPAIR
     TABLE' statements.

   * The `SHOW' statement.  *Note `SHOW': SHOW.

   * Strings may be enclosed by either `"' or `'', not just by `''.

   * Use of the escape `\' character.

   * The `SET OPTION' statement. *Note `SET OPTION': SET OPTION.

   * You don't need to name all selected columns in the `GROUP BY' part.
     This gives better performance for some very specific, but quite
     normal queries.  *Note Group by functions::.

   * One can specify `ASC' and `DESC' with `GROUP BY'.

   * To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
     MySQL supports aliases for many functions. For example, all string
     functions support both ANSI SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

   * MySQL understands the `||' and `&&' operators to mean logical OR
     and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL, `||' and
     `OR' are synonyms, as are `&&' and `AND'.  Because of this nice
     syntax, MySQL doesn't support the ANSI SQL `||' operator for
     string concatenation; use `CONCAT()' instead. Because `CONCAT()'
     takes any number of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the
     `||' operator to MySQL.

   * `CREATE DATABASE' or `DROP DATABASE'.  *Note `CREATE DATABASE':
     CREATE DATABASE.

   * The `%' operator is a synonym for `MOD()'.  That is, `N % M' is
     equivalent to `MOD(N,M)'.  `%' is supported for C programmers and
     for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

   * The `=', `<>', `<=' ,`<', `>=',`>', `<<', `>>', `<=>', `AND',
     `OR', or `LIKE' operators may be used in column comparisons to the
     left of the `FROM' in `SELECT' statements.  For example:

          mysql> SELECT col1=1 AND col2=2 FROM tbl_name;

   * The `LAST_INSERT_ID()' function.  *Note `mysql_insert_id()':
     mysql_insert_id.

   * The `REGEXP' and `NOT REGEXP' extended regular expression
     operators.

   * `CONCAT()' or `CHAR()' with one argument or more than two
     arguments.  (In MySQL, these functions can take any number of
     arguments.)

   * The `BIT_COUNT()', `CASE', `ELT()', `FROM_DAYS()', `FORMAT()',
     `IF()', `PASSWORD()', `ENCRYPT()', `md5()', `ENCODE()', `DECODE()',
     `PERIOD_ADD()', `PERIOD_DIFF()', `TO_DAYS()', or `WEEKDAY()'
     functions.

   * Use of `TRIM()' to trim substrings. ANSI SQL only supports removal
     of single characters.

   * The `GROUP BY' functions `STD()', `BIT_OR()', and `BIT_AND()'.

   * Use of `REPLACE' instead of `DELETE' + `INSERT'.  *Note `REPLACE':
     REPLACE.

   * The `FLUSH', `RESET' and `DO' statements.

   * The possibility to set variables in a statement with `:=':
          SELECT @a:=SUM(total),@b=COUNT(*),@a/@b AS avg FROM test_table;
          SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;

MySQL Differences Compared to ANSI SQL92
----------------------------------------

We try to make MySQL follow the ANSI SQL standard and the ODBC SQL
standard, but in some cases MySQL does some things differently:

   * `--' is only a comment if followed by a white space. *Note Missing
     comments::.

   * For `VARCHAR' columns, trailing spaces are removed when the value
     is stored. *Note Bugs::.

   * In some cases, `CHAR' columns are silently changed to `VARCHAR'
     columns. *Note Silent column changes::.

   * Privileges for a table are not automatically revoked when you
     delete a table. You must explicitly issue a `REVOKE' to revoke
     privileges for a table. *Note `GRANT': GRANT.

   * `NULL AND FALSE' will evaluate to `NULL' and not to `FALSE'.  This
     is because we don't think it's good to have to evaluate a lot of
     extra conditions in this case.

Running MySQL in ANSI Mode
--------------------------

If you start `mysqld' with the `--ansi' option, the following behavior
of MySQL changes:

   * `||' is string concatenation instead of `OR'.

   * You can have any number of spaces between a function name and the
     `('.  This forces all function names to be treated as reserved
     words.

   * `"' will be an identifier quote character (like the MySQL ``'
     quote character) and not a string quote character.

   * `REAL' will be a synonym for `FLOAT' instead of a synonym of
     `DOUBLE'.

   * The default transaction isolation level is `SERIALIZABLE'.  *Note
     SET TRANSACTION::.

This is the same as using
`--sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,SERIALIZE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY'.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Missing Sub-selects,  Next: Missing SELECT INTO TABLE,  Prev: Missing functions,  Up: Missing functions

Sub-selects
...........

MySQL currently only supports sub selects of the form `INSERT ...
SELECT ...' and `REPLACE ... SELECT ...'. You can however use the
function `IN()' in other contexts.

In many cases you can rewrite the query without a sub-select:

     SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);

This can be re-written as:

     SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;

The queries:
     SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
     SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2 where table1.id=table2.id);

Can be rewritten as:

     SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id where table2.id IS NULL

For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
`DELETE' statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in sub-selects).  For this situation there are two options
available until subqueries are supported by MySQL.

The first option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a `SELECT' query to obtain the primary keys for
the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct the
`DELETE' statement (`DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1, key2, ...)').

The second option is to use interactive SQL to contruct a set of
`DELETE' statements automatically, using the MySQL extension `CONCAT()'
(in lieu of the standard `||' operator).  For example:

     SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', tab1.pkid, ';')
       FROM tab1, tab2
      WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;

You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to
the `mysql' command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a
second instance of the interpreter:

     prompt> mysql --skip-column-names mydb < myscript.sql | mysql mydb

MySQL 4.0 supports multi-table deletes that can be used to efficiently
delete rows based on information from one table or even from many tables
at the same time.

`SELECT INTO TABLE'
...................

MySQL doesn't yet support the Oracle SQL extension: `SELECT ... INTO
TABLE ...'.  MySQL supports instead the ANSI SQL syntax `INSERT INTO
... SELECT ...', which is basically the same thing. *Note INSERT
SELECT::.

     INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID FROM tblTemp1 WHERE
     tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID > 100;

Alternatively, you can use `SELECT INTO OUTFILE...' or `CREATE TABLE
... SELECT' to solve your problem.

Transactions
............

As MySQL does nowadays support transactions, the following discussion
is only valid if you are only using the non-transaction-safe table
types. *Note COMMIT::.

The question is often asked, by the curious and the critical, "Why is
MySQL not a transactional database?" or "Why does MySQL not support
transactions?"

MySQL has made a conscious decision to support another paradigm for
data integrity, "atomic operations." It is our thinking and experience
that atomic operations offer equal or even better integrity with much
better performance. We, nonetheless, appreciate and understand the
transactional database paradigm and plan, within the next few releases,
to introduce transaction-safe tables on a per table basis. We will be
giving our users the possibility to decide if they need the speed of
atomic operations or if they need to use transactional features in their
applications.

How does one use the features of MySQL to maintain rigorous integrity
and how do these features compare with the transactional paradigm?

First, in the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written
in a way that is dependent on the calling of "rollback" instead of
"commit" in critical situations, then transactions are more convenient.
Moreover, transactions ensure that unfinished updates or corrupting
activities are not committed to the database; the server is given the
opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is saved.

MySQL, in almost all cases, allows you to solve for potential problems
by including simple checks before updates and by running simple scripts
that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically repair
or warn if such occurs. Note that just by using the MySQL log or even
adding one extra log, one can normally fix tables perfectly with no
data integrity loss.

Moreover, fatal transactional updates can be rewritten to be atomic. In
fact,we will go so far as to say that all integrity problems that
transactions solve can be done with `LOCK TABLES' or atomic updates,
ensuring that you never will get an automatic abort from the database,
which is a common problem with transactional databases.

Not even transactions can prevent all loss if the server goes down.  In
such cases even a transactional system can lose data.  The difference
between different systems lies in just how small the time-lap is where
they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only "secure enough."
Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of transactional databases, is
reported to sometimes lose data in such situations.

To be safe with MySQL, you only need to have backups and have the
update logging turned on.  With this you can recover from any situation
that you could with any transactional database.  It is, of course,
always good to have backups, independent of which database you use.

The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they can
code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary, and
they may have to do a little more work with MySQL to either think
differently or write more. If you are new to the atomic operations
paradigm, or more familiar or more comfortable with transactions, do not
jump to the conclusion that MySQL has not addressed these issues.
Reliability and integrity are foremost in our minds.  Recent estimates
indicate that there are more than 1,000,000 `mysqld' servers currently
running, many of which are in production environments.  We hear very,
very seldom from our users that they have lost any data, and in almost
all of those cases user error is involved. This is, in our opinion, the
best proof of MySQL's stability and reliability.

Lastly, in situations where integrity is of highest importance, MySQL's
current features allow for transaction-level or better reliability and
integrity. If you lock tables with `LOCK TABLES', all updates will
stall until any integrity checks are made.  If you only obtain a read
lock (as opposed to a write lock), then reads and inserts are still
allowed to happen.  The new inserted records will not be seen by any of
the clients that have a `READ' lock until they release their read
locks.  With `INSERT DELAYED' you can queue inserts into a local queue,
until the locks are released, without having the client wait for the
insert to complete. *Note INSERT DELAYED::.

"Atomic," in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only
means that you can be sure that while each specific update is running,
no other user can interfere with it, and there will never be an
automatic rollback (which can happen on transaction based systems if
you are not very careful).  MySQL also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.  You can find some example of how to write atomic
updates in the commit-rollback section. *Note Commit-rollback::.

We have thought quite a bit about integrity and performance, and we
believe that our atomic operations paradigm allows for both high
reliability and extremely high performance, on the order of three to
five times the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned of
transactional databases. We didn't leave out transactions because they
are hard to do. The main reason we went with atomic operations as
opposed to transactions is that by doing this we could apply many speed
optimizations that would not otherwise have been possible.

Many of our users who have speed foremost in their minds are not at all
concerned about transactions. For them transactions are not an issue.
For those of our users who are concerned with or have wondered about
transactions vis-a-vis MySQL, there is a "MySQL way" as we have
outlined above.  For those where safety is more important than speed,
we recommend them to use the `BDB', or `InnoDB' tables for all their
critical data. *Note Table types::.

One final note: We are currently working on a safe replication schema
that we believe to be better than any commercial replication system we
know of. This system will work most reliably under the atomic
operations, non-transactional, paradigm. Stay tuned.

Stored Procedures and Triggers
..............................

A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and
stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to
keep reissuing the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure.
This provides better performance because the query has to be parsed
only once, and less information needs to be sent between the server and
the client. You can also raise the conceptual level by having libraries
of functions in the server.

A trigger is a stored procedure that is invoked when a particular event
occurs.  For example, you can install a stored procedure that is
triggered each time a record is deleted from a transaction table and
that automatically deletes the corresponding customer from a customer
table when all his transactions are deleted.

The planned update language will be able to handle stored procedures,
but without triggers. Triggers usually slow down everything, even
queries for which they are not needed.

To see when MySQL might get stored procedures, see *Note TODO::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Missing Foreign Keys,  Next: Broken Foreign KEY,  Prev: Missing Triggers,  Up: Missing functions

Foreign Keys
............

Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used
mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If
you want to get results from multiple tables from a `SELECT' statement,
you do this by joining tables:

     SELECT * from table1,table2 where table1.id = table2.id;

*Note `JOIN': JOIN. *Note example-Foreign keys::.

The `FOREIGN KEY' syntax in MySQL exists only for compatibility with
other SQL vendors' `CREATE TABLE' commands; it doesn't do anything.
The `FOREIGN KEY' syntax without `ON DELETE ...' is mostly used for
documentation purposes. Some ODBC applications may use this to produce
automatic `WHERE' clauses, but this is usually easy to override.
`FOREIGN KEY' is sometimes used as a constraint check, but this check
is unnecessary in practice if rows are inserted into the tables in the
right order. MySQL only supports these clauses because some
applications require them to exist (regardless of whether or not they
work).

In MySQL, you can work around the problem of `ON DELETE ...' not being
implemented by adding the appropriate `DELETE' statement to an
application when you delete records from a table that has a foreign key.
In practice this is as quick (in some cases quicker) and much more
portable than using foreign keys.

In the near future we will extend the `FOREIGN KEY' implementation so
that at least the information will be saved in the table specification
file and may be retrieved by `mysqldump' and ODBC. At a later stage we
will implement the foreign key constraints for application that can't
easily be coded to avoid them.

* Broken Foreign KEY::          Reasons NOT to use foreign keys constraints


File: mysql.info,  Node: Broken Foreign KEY,  Next: Missing Views,  Prev: Missing Foreign Keys,  Up: Missing functions

Reasons NOT to Use Foreign Keys constraints
...........................................

There are so many problems with foreign key constraints that we don't
know where to start:

   * Foreign key constraints make life very complicated, because the
     foreign key definitions must be stored in a database and
     implementing them would destroy the whole "nice approach" of using
     files that can be moved, copied, and removed.

   * The speed impact is terrible for `INSERT' and `UPDATE' statements,
     and in this case almost all `FOREIGN KEY' constraint checks are
     useless because you usually insert records in the right tables in
     the right order, anyway.

   * There is also a need to hold locks on many more tables when
     updating one table, because the side effects can cascade through
     the entire database. It's MUCH faster to delete records from one
     table first and subsequently delete them from the other tables.

   * You can no longer restore a table by doing a full delete from the
     table and then restoring all records (from a new source or from a
     backup).

   * If you use foreign key constraints you can't dump and restore
     tables unless you do so in a very specific order.

   * It's very easy to do "allowed" circular definitions that make the
     tables impossible to re-create each table with a single create
     statement, even if the definition works and is usable.

   * It's very easy to overlook `FOREIGN KEY ... ON DELETE' rules when
     one codes an application. It's not unusual that one loses a lot of
     important information just because a wrong or misused `ON DELETE'
     rule.

The only nice aspect of `FOREIGN KEY' is that it gives ODBC and some
other client programs the ability to see how a table is connected and
to use this to show connection diagrams and to help in building
applications.

MySQL will soon store `FOREIGN KEY' definitions so that a client can
ask for and receive an answer about how the original connection was
made. The current `.frm' file format does not have any place for it.
At a later stage we will implement the foreign key constraints for
application that can't easily be coded to avoid them.

Views
.....

MySQL doesn't yet support views, but we plan to implement these to
about 4.1.

Views are mostly useful for letting users access a set of relations as
one table (in read-only mode).  Many SQL databases don't allow one to
update any rows in a view, but you have to do the updates in the
separate tables.

As MySQL is mostly used in applications and on web system where the
application writer has full control on the database usage, most of our
users haven't regarded views to be very important. (At least no one has
been interested enough in this to be prepared to finance the
implementation of views).

One doesn't need views in MySQL to restrict access to columns as MySQL
has a very sophisticated privilege system. *Note Privilege system::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Missing comments,  Prev: Missing Views,  Up: Missing functions

`--' as the Start of a Comment
..............................

Some other SQL databases use `--' to start comments. MySQL has `#' as
the start comment character, even if the `mysql' command-line tool
removes all lines that start with `--'.  You can also use the C comment
style `/* this is a comment */' with MySQL.  *Note Comments::.

MySQL Version 3.23.3 and above supports the `--' comment style only if
the comment is followed by a space.  This is because this degenerate
comment style has caused many problems with automatically generated SQL
queries that have used something like the following code, where we
automatically insert the value of the payment for `!payment!':

     UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!

What do you think will happen when the value of `payment' is negative?

Because `1--1' is legal in SQL, we think it is terrible that `--' means
start comment.

In MySQL Version 3.23 you can, however, use: `1-- This is a comment'

The following discussion only concerns you if you are running a MySQL
version earlier than Version 3.23:

If you have a SQL program in a text file that contains `--' comments
you should use:

     shell> replace " --" " #" < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
              | mysql database

instead of the usual:

     shell> mysql database < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql

You can also edit the command file "in place" to change the `--'
comments to `#' comments:

     shell> replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql

Change them back with this command:

     shell> replace " #" " --" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql

How to Cope Without `COMMIT'/`ROLLBACK'
---------------------------------------

The following mostly applies only for `ISAM', `MyISAM', and `HEAP'
tables. If you only use transaction-safe tables (`BDB', or `InnoDB'
tables) in an an update, you can do `COMMIT' and `ROLLBACK' also with
MySQL.  *Note COMMIT::.

The problem with handling `COMMIT'-`ROLLBACK' efficiently with the
above table types would require a completely different table layout
than MySQL uses today.  The table type would also need extra threads
that do automatic cleanups on the tables, and the disk usage would be
much higher. This would make these table types about 2-4 times slower
than they are today.

For the moment, we prefer implementing the SQL server language
(something like stored procedures). With this you would very seldom
really need `COMMIT'-`ROLLBACK.' This would also give much better
performance.

Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
`LOCK TABLES', and you don't need cursors when you can update records
on the fly.

We at TcX had a greater need for a real fast database than a 100%
general database. Whenever we find a way to implement these features
without any speed loss, we will probably do it. For the moment, there
are many more important things to do. Check the TODO for how we
prioritize things at the moment. (Customers with higher levels of
support can alter this, so things may be reprioritized.)

The current problem is actually `ROLLBACK'. Without `ROLLBACK', you can
do any kind of `COMMIT' action with `LOCK TABLES'. To support
`ROLLBACK' with the above table types, MySQL would have to be changed
to store all old records that were updated and revert everything back
to the starting point if `ROLLBACK' was issued. For simple cases, this
isn't that hard to do (the current `isamlog' could be used for this
purpose), but it would be much more difficult to implement `ROLLBACK'
for `ALTER/DROP/CREATE TABLE'.

To avoid using `ROLLBACK', you can use the following strategy:

  1. Use `LOCK TABLES ...' to lock all the tables you want to access.

  2. Test conditions.

  3. Update if everything is okay.

  4. Use `UNLOCK TABLES' to release your locks.

This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with
possible `ROLLBACK's, although not always. The only situation this
solution doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the middle
of an update. In this case, all locks will be released but some of the
updates may not have been executed.

You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following
techniques:

   * Modify fields relative to their current value.

   * Update only those fields that actually have changed.

For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none
of the changed data, or data that depend on the changed data, has
changed compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done
with the `WHERE' clause in the `UPDATE' statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: "Some of the data you have
changed have been changed by another user". Then we show the old row
versus the new row in a window, so the user can decide which version of
the customer record he should use.

This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is
actually even better, because we only update some of the columns, using
values that are relative to their current values.  This means that
typical `UPDATE' statements look something like these:

     UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+'relative change';
     
     UPDATE customer
       SET
         customer_date='current_date',
         address='new address',
         phone='new phone',
         money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us+'new_money'
       WHERE
         customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';

As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client
has changed the values in the `pay_back' or `money_he_owes_us' columns.

In many cases, users have wanted `ROLLBACK' and/or `LOCK TABLES' for
the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables. This can be
handled much more efficiently by using an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column and
either the SQL function `LAST_INSERT_ID()' or the C API function
`mysql_insert_id()'. *Note `mysql_insert_id()': mysql_insert_id.

At MySQL AB, we have never had any need for row-level locking because
we have always been able to code around it. Some cases really need row
locking, but they are very few. If you want row-level locking, you can
use a flag column in the table and do something like this:

     UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;

MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was found
and `row_flag' wasn't already 1 in the original row.

You can think of it as MySQL changed the above query to:

     UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID and row_flag <> 1;

Known errors and design deficiencies in MySQL
---------------------------------------------

The following problems are known and have a very high priority to get
fixed:

   * `ANALYZE TABLE' on a BDB table may in some case make the table
     unusable until one has restarted `mysqld'.  When this happens you
     will see errors like the following in the MySQL error file:

          001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log

   * Don't execute `ALTER TABLE' on a `BDB' table on which you are
     running not completed multi-statement transactions. (The
     transaction will probably be ignored).

   * `ANALYZE TABLE', `OPTIMIZE TABLE' and `REPAIR TABLE' may cause
     problems on tables for which you are using `INSERT DELAYED'.

   * Doing a `LOCK TABLE ..' and `FLUSH TABLES ..' doesn't guarantee
     that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the
     table.

   * BDB tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many BDB tables in a
     database, it will take a long time to use the `mysql' client on the
     database if you are not using the `-A' option or if you are using
     `rehash'. This is especially notable when you have a big table
     cache.

   * Th current replication protocol cannot deal with `LOAD DATA INFILE'
     and line terminator characters of more than 1 character.

The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:

   * For the moment `MATCH' only works with `SELECT' statements.

   * When using `SET CHARACTER SET', one can't use translated
     characters in database, table and column names.

   * `DELETE FROM merge_table' used without a `WHERE' will only clear
     the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the mapped
     tables

   * You cannot build in another directory when using MIT-pthreads.
     Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not likely
     to fix this.

   * `BLOB' values can't "reliably" be used in `GROUP BY' or `ORDER BY'
     or `DISTINCT'. Only the first `max_sort_length' bytes (default
     1024) are used when comparing `BLOB'bs in these cases.  This can
     be changed with the `-O max_sort_length' option to `mysqld'. A
     workaround for most cases is to use a substring: `SELECT DISTINCT
     LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name'.

   * Calculation is done with `BIGINT' or `DOUBLE' (both are normally
     64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one
     gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with `BIGINT'
     precision, `IF', and `ELT()' with `BIGINT' or `DOUBLE' precision
     and the rest with `DOUBLE' precision.  One should try to avoid
     using bigger unsigned long long values than 63 bits
     (9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit fields!

   * All string columns, except `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns, automatically
     have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For `CHAR' types
     this is okay, and may be regarded as a feature according to ANSI
     SQL92. The bug is that in MySQL, `VARCHAR' columns are treated the
     same way.

   * You can only have up to 255 `ENUM' and `SET' columns in one table.

   * `safe_mysqld' re-directs all messages from `mysqld' to the
     `mysqld' log.  One problem with this is that if you execute
     `mysqladmin refresh' to close and reopen the log, `stdout' and
     `stderr' are still redirected to the old log.  If you use `--log'
     extensively, you should edit `safe_mysqld' to log to
     `'hostname'.err' instead of `'hostname'.log' so you can easily
     reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and
     executing `mysqladmin refresh'.

   * In the `UPDATE' statement, columns are updated from left to right.
     If you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value
     instead of the original value. For example:

          mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;

     This will update `KEY' with `2' instead of with `1'.

   * You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
     For example, the following doesn't work.

          select * from temporary_table, temporary_table as t2;

   * `RENAME' doesn't work with `TEMPORARY' tables.

   * The optimizer may handle `DISTINCT' differently if you are using
     'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are
     counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in
     normal queries hidden columns doesn't participate in the `DISTINCT'
     comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never
     compare the hidden columns when executing `DISTINCT'

     An example of this is:

          SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id
          DESC;

     and

          SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id, FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
          WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9 AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
          ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;

     In the second case you may in MySQL 3.23.x get two identical rows
     in the result set (because the hidden 'id' column may differ).

     Note that the this only happens for queries where you don't have
     the ORDER BY columns in the result, something that is you are not
     allowed to do in ANSI SQL.

   * Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that doesn't
     support transactions (and thus can't `rollback' data) some things
     behaves a little different in MySQL than in other SQL servers:
     (This is just to ensure that MySQL never need to do a rollback for
     a SQL command).  This may be a little awkward at times as column
     Because MySQL allows you to work with table types that don't
     support transactions, and thus can't `rollback' data, some things
     behave a little differently in MySQL than in other SQL servers.
     This is just to ensure that MySQL never need to do a rollback for
     a SQL command.  This may be a little awkward at times as column
     values must be checked in the application, but this will actually
     give you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL to do some
     optimizations that otherwise would be very hard to do.

     If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL will, instead of
     doing a rollback, store the `best possible value' in the column:

        - If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical
          column, MySQL will instead store the smallest or biggest
          possible value in the column.

        - If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number
          into a numerical column, MySQL will store 0 into it.

        - If you try to store `NULL' into a column that doesn't take
          `NULL' values, MySQL will store 0 or `''' (empty string) in
          it instead. (This behavior can, however, be changed with the
          -DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compile option).

        - MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into `DATE'
          and `DATETIME' columns. (Like 2000-02-31 or 2000-02-00).  If
          the date is totally wrong, MySQL will store the special
          0000-00-00 date value in the column.

        - If you set an `enum' to an unsupported value, it will be set
          to the error value 'empty string', with numeric value 0.

   * If you execute a `PROCEDURE' on a query that returns an empty set,
     in some cases the `PROCEDURE' will not transform the columns.

   * Creation of a table of type `MERGE' doesn't check if the underlying
     tables are of compatible types.

   * MySQL can't yet handle `NaN', `-Inf' and `Inf' values in double.
     Using these will cause problems when trying to export and import
     data. We should as an intermediate solution change `NaN' to `NULL'
     (if possible) and `-Inf' and `Inf' to the Minimum respective
     maximum possible `double' value.

   * `LIMIT' on negative numbers are treated as big positive numbers.

   * If you use `ALTER TABLE' to first add an `UNIQUE' index to a table
     used in a `MERGE' table and then use `ALTER TABLE' to add a normal
     index on the `MERGE' table, the key order will be different for
     the tables if there was an old not-unique key in the table. This
     is because `ALTER TABLE' puts `UNIQUE' keys before normal keys to
     be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.

The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:

   * You can get a hung thread if you do a `DROP TABLE' on a table that
     is one among many tables that is locked with `LOCK TABLES'.

   * In the following case you can get a core dump:

        - Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.

        - `LOCK table' with `WRITE'

        - `FLUSH TABLES'

   * Before MySQL Version 3.23.2 an `UPDATE' that updated a key with a
     `WHERE' on the same key may have failed because the key was used to
     search for records and the same row may have been found multiple
     times:

          UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY > 100;

     A workaround is to use:

          mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 > 100;

     This will work because MySQL will not use index on expressions in
     the `WHERE' clause.

   * Before MySQL Version 3.23, all numeric types where treated as
     fixed-point fields. That means you had to specify how many
     decimals a floating-point field shall have. All results were
     returned with the correct number of decimals.

For platform-specific bugs, see the sections about compiling and
porting.

How MySQL Compares to `mSQL'
----------------------------

*Performance*
     For a true comparison of speed, consult the growing MySQL benchmark
     suite. *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

     Because there is no thread creation overhead, a small parser, few
     features, and simple security, `mSQL' should be quicker at:

        * Tests that perform repeated connects and disconnects, running
          a very simple query during each connection.

        * `INSERT' operations into very simple tables with few columns
          and keys.

        * `CREATE TABLE' and `DROP TABLE'.

        * `SELECT' on something that isn't an index. (A table scan is
          very easy.)

     Because these operations are so simple, it is hard to be better at
     them when you have a higher startup overhead. After the connection
     is established, MySQL should perform much better.

     On the other hand, MySQL is much faster than `mSQL' (and most
     other SQL implementations) on the following:

        * Complex `SELECT' operations.

        * Retrieving large results (MySQL has a better, faster, and
          safer protocol).

        * Tables with variable-length strings, because MySQL has more
          efficient handling and can have indexes on `VARCHAR' columns.

        * Handling tables with many columns.

        * Handling tables with large record lengths.

        * `SELECT' with many expressions.

        * `SELECT' on large tables.

        * Handling many connections at the same time. MySQL is fully
          multi-threaded. Each connection has its own thread, which
          means that no thread has to wait for another (unless a thread
          is modifying a table another thread wants to access). In
          `mSQL', once one connection is established, all others must
          wait until the first has finished, regardless of whether the
          connection is running a query that is short or long. When the
          first connection terminates, the next can be served, while
          all the others wait again, etc.

        * Joins.  `mSQL' can become pathologically slow if you change
          the order of tables in a `SELECT'. In the benchmark suite, a
          time more than 15000 times slower than MySQL was seen.  This
          is due to `mSQL''s lack of a join optimizer to order tables
          in the optimal order. However, if you put the tables in
          exactly the right order in `mSQL'2 and the `WHERE' is simple
          and uses index columns, the join will be relatively fast!
          *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

        * `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY'.

        * `DISTINCT'.

        * Using `TEXT' or `BLOB' columns.

*SQL Features*
        * `GROUP BY' and `HAVING'.  `mSQL' does not support `GROUP BY'
          at all.  MySQL supports a full `GROUP BY' with both `HAVING'
          and the following functions: `COUNT()', `AVG()', `MIN()',
          `MAX()', `SUM()', and `STD()'.  `COUNT(*)' is optimized to
          return very quickly if the `SELECT' retrieves from one table,
          no other columns are retrieved, and there is no `WHERE'
          clause.  `MIN()' and `MAX()' may take string arguments.

        * `INSERT' and `UPDATE' with calculations.  MySQL can do
          calculations in an `INSERT' or `UPDATE'.  For example:

               mysql> UPDATE SET x=x*10+y WHERE x<20;

        * Aliasing.  MySQL has column aliasing.

        * Qualifying column names.  In MySQL, if a column name is
          unique among the tables used in a query, you do not have to
          use the full qualifier.

        * `SELECT' with functions.  MySQL has many functions (too many
          to list here; see *Note Functions::).


*Disk Space Efficiency*
     That is, how small can you make your tables?

     MySQL has very precise types, so you can create tables that take
     very little space. An example of a useful MySQL datatype is the
     `MEDIUMINT' that is 3 bytes long. If you have 100,000,000 records,
     saving even one byte per record is very important.

     `mSQL2' has a more limited set of column types, so it is more
     difficult to get small tables.

*Stability*
     This is harder to judge objectively. For a discussion of MySQL
     stability, see *Note Stability::.

     We have no experience with `mSQL' stability, so we cannot say
     anything about that.

*Price*
     Another important issue is the license. MySQL has a more flexible
     license than `mSQL', and is also less expensive than `mSQL'.
     Whichever product you choose to use, remember to at least consider
     paying for a license or e-mail support.  (You are required to get
     a license if you include MySQL with a product that you sell, of
     course.)

*Perl Interfaces*
     MySQL has basically the same interfaces to Perl as `mSQL' with
     some added features.

*JDBC (Java)*
     MySQL currently has a lot of different JDBC drivers:

        * The mm driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Mark Matthews
          <mmatthew@ecn.purdue.edu>.  This is released under the LGPL.

        * The Resin driver. This is a commercial JDBC driver released
          under open source.
          `http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp'

        * The gwe driver: A Java interface by GWE technologies (not
          supported anymore).

        * The jms driver: An improved gwe driver by Xiaokun Kelvin ZHU
          <X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk> (not supported anymore).

        * The twz driver: A type 4 JDBC driver by Terrence W. Zellers
          <zellert@voicenet.com>.  This is commercial but is free for
          private and educational use (not supported anymore).

     The recommended driver is the mm driver. The Resin driver may also
     be good (at least the benchmarks looks good), but we haven't
     received that much information about this yet.

     We know that `mSQL' has a JDBC driver, but we have too little
     experience with it to compare.

*Rate of Development*
     MySQL has a very small team of developers, but we are quite used
     to coding C and C++ very rapidly. Because threads, functions,
     `GROUP BY', and so on are still not implemented in `mSQL', it has
     a lot of catching up to do. To get some perspective on this, you
     can view the `mSQL' `HISTORY' file for the last year and compare
     it with the News section of the MySQL Reference Manual (*note
     News::). It should be pretty obvious which one has developed most
     rapidly.

*Utility Programs*
     Both `mSQL' and MySQL have many interesting third-party tools.
     Because it is very easy to port upward (from `mSQL' to MySQL),
     almost all the interesting applications that are available for
     `mSQL' are also available for MySQL.

     MySQL comes with a simple `msql2mysql' program that fixes
     differences in spelling between `mSQL' and MySQL for the most-used
     C API functions.  For example, it changes instances of
     `msqlConnect()' to `mysql_connect()'. Converting a client program
     from `mSQL' to MySQL usually takes a couple of minutes.

How to Convert `mSQL' Tools for MySQL
.....................................

According to our experience, it would just take a few hours to convert
tools such as `msql-tcl' and `msqljava' that use the `mSQL' C API so
that they work with the MySQL C API.

The conversion procedure is:

  1. Run the shell script `msql2mysql' on the source. This requires the
     `replace' program, which is distributed with MySQL.

  2. Compile.

  3. Fix all compiler errors.

Differences between the `mSQL' C API and the MySQL C API are:

   * MySQL uses a `MYSQL' structure as a connection type (`mSQL' uses
     an `int').

   * `mysql_connect()' takes a pointer to a `MYSQL' structure as a
     parameter.  It is easy to define one globally or to use `malloc()'
     to get one.  `mysql_connect()' also takes two parameters for
     specifying the user and password.  You may set these to `NULL,
     NULL' for default use.

   * `mysql_error()' takes the `MYSQL' structure as a parameter. Just
     add the parameter to your old `msql_error()' code if you are
     porting old code.

   * MySQL returns an error number and a text error message for all
     errors. `mSQL' returns only a text error message.

   * Some incompatibilities exist as a result of MySQL supporting
     multiple connections to the server from the same process.

How `mSQL' and MySQL Client/Server Communications Protocols Differ
..................................................................

There are enough differences that it is impossible (or at least not
easy) to support both.

The most significant ways in which the MySQL protocol differs from the
`mSQL' protocol are listed below:

   * A message buffer may contain many result rows.

   * The message buffers are dynamically enlarged if the query or the
     result is bigger than the current buffer, up to a configurable
     server and client limit.

   * All packets are numbered to catch duplicated or missing packets.

   * All column values are sent in ASCII. The lengths of columns and
     rows are sent in packed binary coding (1, 2, or 3 bytes).

   * MySQL can read in the result unbuffered (without having to store
     the full set in the client).

   * If a single read/write takes more than 30 seconds, the server
     closes the connection.

   * If a connection is idle for 8 hours, the server closes the
     connection.

How `mSQL' 2.0 SQL Syntax Differs from MySQL
............................................

*Column types*

`MySQL'
     Has the following additional types (among others; *note `CREATE
     TABLE': CREATE TABLE.):
        * `ENUM' type for one of a set of strings.

        * `SET' type for many of a set of strings.

        * `BIGINT' type for 64-bit integers.

`'
     MySQL also supports the following additional type attributes:
        * `UNSIGNED' option for integer columns.

        * `ZEROFILL' option for integer columns.

        * `AUTO_INCREMENT' option for integer columns that are a
          `PRIMARY KEY'.  *Note `mysql_insert_id()': mysql_insert_id.

        * `DEFAULT' value for all columns.

`mSQL2'
     `mSQL' column types correspond to the MySQL types shown below:
     `mSQL'     *Corresponding MySQL type*
     *type*     
     `CHAR(len)'`CHAR(len)'
     `TEXT(len)'`TEXT(len)'. `len' is the maximal length.  And `LIKE'
                works.
     `INT'      `INT'. With many more options!
     `REAL'     `REAL'. Or `FLOAT'. Both 4- and 8-byte versions are
                available.
     `UINT'     `INT UNSIGNED'
     `DATE'     `DATE'. Uses ANSI SQL format rather than `mSQL''s own
                format.
     `TIME'     `TIME'
     `MONEY'    `DECIMAL(12,2)'. A fixed-point value with two decimals.

*Index Creation*

`MySQL'
     Indexes may be specified at table creation time with the `CREATE
     TABLE' statement.

`mSQL'
     Indexes must be created after the table has been created, with
     separate `CREATE INDEX' statements.

*To Insert a Unique Identifier into a Table*

`MySQL'
     Use `AUTO_INCREMENT' as a column type specifier.  *Note
     `mysql_insert_id()': mysql_insert_id.

`mSQL'
     Create a `SEQUENCE' on a table and select the `_seq' column.

*To Obtain a Unique Identifier for a Row*

`MySQL'
     Add a `PRIMARY KEY' or `UNIQUE' key to the table and use this.
     New in Version 3.23.11: If the `PRIMARY' or `UNIQUE' key consists
     of only one column and this is of type integer, one can also refer
     to it as `_rowid'.

`mSQL'
     Use the `_rowid' column. Observe that `_rowid' may change over time
     depending on many factors.

*To Get the Time a Column Was Last Modified*

`MySQL'
     Add a `TIMESTAMP' column to the table. This column is
     automatically set to the current date and time for `INSERT' or
     `UPDATE' statements if you don't give the column a value or if you
     give it a `NULL' value.

`mSQL'
     Use the `_timestamp' column.

*`NULL' Value Comparisons*

`MySQL'
     MySQL follows ANSI SQL, and a comparison with `NULL' is always
     `NULL'.

`mSQL'
     In `mSQL', `NULL = NULL' is TRUE.  You must change `=NULL' to `IS
     NULL' and `<>NULL' to `IS NOT NULL' when porting old code from
     `mSQL' to MySQL.

*String Comparisons*

`MySQL'
     Normally, string comparisons are performed in case-independent
     fashion with the sort order determined by the current character
     set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default).  If you don't like this,
     declare your columns with the `BINARY' attribute, which causes
     comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the
     MySQL server host.

`mSQL'
     All string comparisons are performed in case-sensitive fashion with
     sorting in ASCII order.

*Case-insensitive Searching*

`MySQL'
     `LIKE' is a case-insensitive or case-sensitive operator, depending
     on the columns involved. If possible, MySQL uses indexes if the
     `LIKE' argument doesn't start with a wild-card character.

`mSQL'
     Use `CLIKE'.

*Handling of Trailing Spaces*

`MySQL'
     Strips all spaces at the end of `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' columns. Use
     a `TEXT' column if this behavior is not desired.

`mSQL'
     Retains trailing space.

*`WHERE' Clauses*

`MySQL'
     MySQL correctly prioritizes everything (`AND' is evaluated before
     `OR'). To get `mSQL' behavior in MySQL, use parentheses (as shown
     in an example below).

`mSQL'
     Evaluates everything from left to right. This means that some
     logical calculations with more than three arguments cannot be
     expressed in any way. It also means you must change some queries
     when you upgrade to MySQL. You do this easily by adding
     parentheses.  Suppose you have the following `mSQL' query:
          mysql> SELECT * FROM table WHERE a=1 AND b=2 OR a=3 AND b=4;
     To make MySQL evaluate this the way that `mSQL' would, you must
     add parentheses:
          mysql> SELECT * FROM table WHERE (a=1 AND (b=2 OR (a=3 AND (b=4))));

*Access Control*

`MySQL'
     Has tables to store grant (permission) options per user, host, and
     database. *Note Privileges::.

`mSQL'
     Has a file `mSQL.acl' in which you can grant read/write privileges
     for users.

How MySQL Compares to PostgreSQL
--------------------------------

When reading the following, please note that both products are
continually evolving.  We at MySQL AB and the PostgreSQL developers are
both working on making our respective database as good as possible, so
we are both a serious choice to any commercial database.

The following comparison is made by us at MySQL AB.  We have tried to be
as accurate and fair as possible, but because we don't have a full
knowledge of all PostgreSQL features while we know MySQL througly, we
may have got some things wrong.  We will however correct these when they
come to our attention.

We would first like to note that PostgreSQL and MySQL are both widely
used products, but with different design goals, even if we are both
striving to be ANSI SQL compatible.  This means that for some
applications MySQL is more suited, while for others PostgreSQL is more
suited.  When choosing which database to use, you should first check if
the database's feature set satisfies your application.  If you need raw
speed, MySQL is probably your best choice.  If you need some of the
extra features that only PostgreSQL can offer, you should use
`PostgreSQL'.

MySQL and PostgreSQL development strategies
...........................................

When adding things to MySQL we take pride to do an optimal, definite
solution.  The code should be so good that we shouldn't have any need to
change it in the foreseeable future.  We also do not like to sacrifice
speed for features but instead will do our utmost to find a solution
that will give maximal throughput.  This means that development will
take a little longer, but the end result will be well worth this.  This
kind of development is only possible because all server code are
checked by one of a few (currently two) persons before it's included in
the MySQL server.

We at MySQL AB believe in frequent releases to be able to push out new
features quickly to our users.  Because of this we do a new small
release about every three weeks, and a major branch every year.  All
releases are throughly tested with our testing tools on a lot of
different platforms.

PostgreSQL is based on a kernel with lots of contributors. In this setup
it makes sense to prioritize adding a lot of new features, instead of
implementing them optimally, because one can always optimize things
later if there arises a need for this.

Another big difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL is that nearly all
of the code in the MySQL server are coded by developers that are
employed by MySQL AB and are still working on the server code. The
exceptions are the transaction engines, and the regexp library.

This is in sharp contrast to the PostgreSQL code where the majority of
the code is coded by a big group of people with different backgrounds.
It was only recently that the PostgreSQL developers announced that their
current developer group had finally had time to take a look at all the
code in the current PostgreSQL release.

Both of the above development methods has it's own merits and drawbacks.
We here at MySQL AB think of course that our model is better because our
model gives better code consistency, more optimal and reusable code, and
in our opinion, fewer bugs.  Because we are the authors of the MySQL
server code, we are better able to coordinate new features and releases.

Featurewise Comparison of MySQL and PostgreSQL
..............................................

On the crash-me (http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php) page
you can find a list of those database constructs and limits that one
can detect automatically with a program.  Note however that a lot of
the numerical limits may be changed with startup options for respective
database.  The above web page is however extremely useful when you want
to ensure that your applications works with many different databases or
when you want to convert your application from one datbase to another.

MySQL offers the following advantages over PostgreSQL:

   * `MySQL' is generally much faster than PostgreSQL.  *Note
     MySQL-PostgreSQL benchmarks::.

   * MySQL has a much larger user base than PostgreSQL, therefor the
     code is more tested and has historically been more stable than
     PostgreSQL.  MySQL is the much more used in production
     environments than PostgreSQL, mostly thanks to that MySQL AB,
     formerly TCX DataKonsult AB, has provided top quality commercial
     support for MySQL from the day it was released, whereas until
     recently PostgreSQL was unsupported.

   * MySQL works better on Windows than PostgreSQL does.  MySQL runs as
     a native Windows application (a service on NT/Win2000/WinXP), while
     PostgreSQL is run under the cygwin emulation.  We have heard that
     PostgreSQL is not yet that stable on Windows but we haven't been
     able to verify this ourselves.

   * MySQL has more APIs to other languages and is supported by more
     existing programs than PostgreSQL.  *Note Contrib::.

   * MySQL works on 24/7 heavy duty systems.  In most circumstances you
     never have to run any cleanups on MySQL.  PostgreSQL doesn't yet
     support 24/7 systems because you have to run `VACUUM()' once in a
     while to reclaim space from `UPDATE' and `DELETE' commands and to
     perform statistics analyzes that are critical to get good
     performance with PostgreSQL.  `VACUUM()' is also needed after
     adding a lot of new rows to a table.  On a busy system with lots
     of changes, `VACUUM()' must be run very frequently, in the worst
     cases even many times a day.  During the `VACUUM()' run, which may
     take hours if the database is big, the database is from a
     production standpoint, practically dead.  The PostgreSQL team has
     fixing this on their TODO, but we assume that this is not an easy
     thing to fix permanently.

   * A working, tested replication feature used by sites like:
        - Yahoo Finance (`http://finance.yahoo.com')

        - Mobile.de (`http://www.mobile.de/')

        - Slashdot (`http://www.slashdot.org')

   * Included in the MySQL distribution are two different testing
     suites, `mysql-test-run' and crash-me
     (http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php), as well as a
     benchmark suite.  The test system is actively updated with code to
     test each new feature and almost all repeatable bugs that have
     come to our attention.  We test MySQL with these on a lot of
     platforms before every release.  These tests are more
     sophisticated than anything we have seen from PostgreSQL, and they
     ensures that the MySQL is kept to a high standard.

   * There are far more books in print about MySQL than about
     PostgreSQL.  O'Reilly, Sams, Que, and New Riders are all major
     publishers with books about MySQL.  All MySQL features are also
     documented in the MySQL on-line manual, because when a new feature
     is implemented, the MySQL developers are required to document it
     before it's included in the source.

   * MySQL supports more of the standard ODBC functions than
     `PostgreSQL'.

   * MySQL has a much more sophisticated `ALTER TABLE'.

   * MySQL has support for tables without transactions for applications
     that need all speed they can get. The tables may be memory based,
     `HEAP' tables or disk based `MyISAM'.  *Note Table types::.

   * MySQL has support for two different table handlers that support
     transactions, `BerkeleyDB' and `InnoDB'.  Because every
     transaction engine performs differently under different
     conditions, this gives the application writer more options to find
     an optimal solution for his or her setup.  *Note Table types::.

   * `MERGE' tables gives you a unique way to instantly make a view over
     a set of identical tables and use these as one.  This is perfect
     for systems where you have log files that you order for example by
     month.  *Note MERGE::.

   * The option to compress read-only tables, but still have direct
     access to the rows in the table, gives you better performance by
     minimizing disk reads.  This is very useful when you are archiving
     things.  *Note myisampack::.

   * MySQL has internal support for fulltext search. *Note Fulltext
     Search::.

   * You can access many databases from the same connection (depending
     of course on your privileges).

   * MySQL is coded from the start to be multi-threaded while
     PostgreSQL uses processes.  Context switching and access to common
     storage areas is much faster between threads than between separate
     processes, this gives MySQL a big speed advantage in multi-user
     applications and also makes it easier for MySQL to take full
     advantage of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems.

   * MySQL has a much more sophisticated privilege system than
     PostgreSQL.  While PostgreSQL only supports `INSERT', `SELECT', and
     `UPDATE/DELETE' grants per user on a database or a table, MySQL
     allows you to define a full set of different privileges on
     database, table and column level.  MySQL also allows you to
     specify the privilege on host and user combinations.  *Note
     GRANT::.

   * MySQL supports a compressed client/server protocol which improves
     performance over slow links.

   * MySQL employs a "table handler" concept, and is the only relational
     database we know of built around this concept.  This allows
     different low-level table types to be swapped into the SQL engine,
     and each table type can be optimized for different performance
     characteristics.

   * All MySQL table types (except *InnoDB*) are implemented as files
     (one table per file), which makes it really easy to backup, move,
     delete and even symlink databases and tables, even when the server
     is down.

   * Tools to repair and optimize *MyISAM* tables (the most common
     MySQL table type).  A repair tool is only needed when a physical
     corruption of a data file happens, usually from a hardware
     failure.  It allows a majority of the data to be recovered.

   * Upgrading MySQL is painless.  When you are upgrading MySQL, you
     don't need to dump/restore your data, as you have to do with most
     PostgreSQL upgrades.

Drawbacks with MySQL compared to PostgreSQL:

   * The transaction support in MySQL is not yet as well tested as
     PostgreSQL's system.

   * Because MySQL uses threads, which are not yet flawless on many
     OSes, one must either use binaries from
     `http://www.mysql.com/downloads', or carefully follow our
     instructions on
     `http://www.mysql.com/doc/I/n/Installing_source.html' to get an
     optimal binary that works in all cases.

   * Table locking, as used by the non-transactional `MyISAM' tables, is
     in many cases faster than page locks, row locks or versioning.  The
     drawback however is that if one doesn't take into account how table
     locks work, a single long-running query can block a table for
     updates for a long time. This can usable be avoided when designing
     the application.  If not, one can always switch the trouble table
     to use one of the transactional table types. *Note Table locking::.

   * With UDF (user defined functions) one can extend MySQL with both
     normal SQL functions and aggregates, but this is not yet as easy
     or as flexible as in PostgreSQL.  *Note Adding functions::.

   * Updates and deletes that run over multiple tables is harder to do
     in MySQL. This will, hoever, be fixed in MySQL 4.0 with multi-table
     `DELETE' and multi-table `UPDATE' and in MySQL 4.1 with subselects.

PostgreSQL currently offers the following advantages over MySQL:

Note that because we know the MySQL road map, we have included in the
following table the version when MySQL should support this feature.
Unfortunately we couldn't do this for previous comparison, because we
don't know the PostgreSQL roadmap.

*Feature*                                          *MySQL version*
Subselects                                         4.1
Foreign keys                                       4.0 and 4.1
Views                                              4.2
Stored procedures                                  4.1
Extensible type system                             Not planned
Unions                                             4.0
Full join                                          4.0 or 4.1
Triggers                                           4.1
Constrainst                                        4.1
Cursors                                            4.1 or 4.2
Extensible index types like R-trees                R-trees are planned
                                                   for 4.2
Inherited tables                                   Not planned

Other reasons to use PostgreSQL:

   * Standard usage in PostgreSQL is closer to ANSI SQL in some cases.

   * One can speed up PostgreSQL by coding things as stored procedures.

   * PostgreSQL has a bigger team of developers that contribute to the
     server.

Drawbacks with PostgreSQL compared to MySQL:

   * `VACUUM()' makes PostgreSQL hard to use in a 24/7 environment.

   * Only transactional tables.

   * Much slower `INSERT', `DELETE', and `UPDATE'.

* MySQL-PostgreSQL benchmarks::  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL

Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL
.................................

The only open source benchmark that we know of that can be used to
benchmark MySQL and PostgreSQL (and other databases) is our own. It can
be found at `http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html'.

We have many times asked the PostgreSQL developers and some PostgreSQL
users to help us extend this benchmark to make it the definitive
benchmark for databases, but unfortunately we haven't gotten any
feedback for this.

We the MySQL developers have, because of this, spent a lot of hours to
get maximum performance from PostgreSQL for the benchmarks, but because
we don't know PostgreSQL intimately, we are sure that there are things
that we have missed.  We have on the benchmark page documented exactly
how we did run the benchmark so that it should be easy for anyone to
repeat and verify our results.

The benchmarks are usually run with and without the `--fast' option.
When run with `--fast' we are trying to use every trick the server can
do to get the code to execute as fast as possible.  The idea is that the
normal run should show how the server would work in a default setup and
the `--fast' run shows how the server would do if the application
developer would use extensions in the server to make his application run
faster.

When running with PostgreSQL and `--fast' we do a `VACUUM()' after
every major table `UPDATE' and `DROP TABLE' to make the database in
perfect shape for the following `SELECT's.  The time for `VACUUM()' is
measured separately.

When running with PostgreSQL 7.1.1 we could, however, not run with
`--fast' because during the `INSERT' test, the postmaster (the
PostgreSQL deamon) died and the database was so corrupted that it was
impossible to restart postmaster.   After this happened twice, we
decided to postpone the `--fast' test until next PostgreSQL release.
The details about the machine we run the benchmark can be found on the
benchmark page.

Before going to the other benchmarks we know of, we would like to give
some background on benchmarks:

It's very easy to write a test that shows ANY database to be best
database in the world, by just restricting the test to something the
database is very good at and not test anything that the database is not
good at.  If one after this publishes the result with a single figure,
things are even easier.

This would be like us measuring the speed of MySQL compared to
PostgreSQL by looking at the summary time of the MySQL benchmarks on
our web page.  Based on this MySQL would be more than 40 times faster
than PostgreSQL, something that is of course not true.  We could make
things even worse by just taking the test where PostgreSQL performs
worst and claim that MySQL is more than 2000 times faster than
PostgreSQL.

The case is that MySQL does a lot of optimizations that PostgreSQL
doesn't do. This is of course also true the other way around.  An SQL
optimizer is a very complex thing, and a company could spend years on
just making the optimizer faster and faster.

When looking at the benchmark results you should look for things that
you do in your application and just use these results to decide which
database would be best suited for your application.  The benchmark
results also shows things a particular database is not good at and
should give you a notion about things to avoid and what you may have to
do in other ways.

We know of two benchmark tests that claims that PostgreSQL performs
better than MySQL.  These both where multi-user tests, a test that we
here at MySQL AB haven't had time to write and include in the benchmark
suite, mainly because it's a big task to do this in a manner that is
fair against all databases.

One is the benchmark paid for by Great Bridge, which you can read about
at: `http://www.greatbridge.com/about/press.php?content_id=4'.

This is the probably worst benchmark we have ever seen anyone conduct.
This was not only tuned to only test what PostgreSQL is absolutely best
at, it was also totally unfair against every other database involved in
the test.

*NOTE*:  We know that not even some of the main PostgreSQL developers
did like the way Great Bridge conducted the benchmark, so we don't
blame them for the way the benchmark was made.

This benchmark has been condemned in a lot of postings and newsgroups so
we will here just shortly repeat some things that where wrong with it.

   * The tests were run with an expensive commercial tool, that makes it
     impossible for an open source company like us to verify the
     benchmarks, or even check how the benchmarks were really done.
     The tool is not even a true benchmark tool, but an
     application/setup testing tool.  To refer this as a "standard"
     benchmark tool is to stretch the truth a long way.

   * Great Bridge admitted that they had optimized the PostgreSQL
     database (with `VACUUM()' before the test) and tuned the startup
     for the tests, something they hadn't done for any of the other
     databases involved.  To say "This process optimizes indexes and
     frees up disk space a bit.  The optimized indexes boost
     performance by some margin."  Our benchmarks clearly indicate that
     the difference in running a lot of selects on a database with and
     without `VACUUM()' can easily differ by a factor of ten.

   * The test results were also strange.  The AS3AP test documentation
     mentions that the test does "selections, simple joins, projections,
     aggregates, one-tuple updates, and bulk updates".

     PostgreSQL is good at doing `SELECT's and `JOIN's (especially
     after a `VACUUM()'), but doesn't perform as well on `INSERT's or
     `UPDATE's.  The benchmarks seem to indicate that only `SELECT's
     were done (or very few updates).  This could easily explain they
     good results for PostgreSQL in this test.  The bad results for
     MySQL will be obvious a bit down in this document.

   * They did run the so-called benchmark from a Windows machine
     against a Linux machine over ODBC, a setup that no normal database
     user would ever do when running a heavy multi-user application.
     This tested more the ODBC driver and the Windows protocol used
     between the clients than the database itself.

   * When running the database against Oracle and MS-SQL (Great Bridge
     has indirectly indicated that the databases they used in the
     test), they didn't use the native protocol but instead ODBC.
     Anyone that has ever used Oracle knows that all real application
     uses the native interface instead of ODBC.  Doing a test through
     ODBC and claiming that the results had anything to do with using
     the database in a real-world situation can't be regarded as fair.
     They should have done two tests with and without ODBC to provide
     the right facts (after having got experts to tune all involved
     databases of course).

   * They refer to the TPC-C tests, but they don't mention anywhere
     that the test they did was not a true TPC-C test and they were not
     even allowed to call it a TPC-C test.  A TPC-C test can only be
     conducted by the rules approved by the TPC Council
     (`http://www.tpc.org'). Great Bridge didn't do that.  By doing
     this they have both violated the TPC trademark and miscredited
     their own benchmarks.  The rules set by the TPC Council are very
     strict to ensure that no one can produce false results or make
     unprovable statements.  Apparently Great Bridge wasn't interested
     in doing this.

   * After the first test, we contacted Great Bridge and mentioned to
     them some of the obvious mistakes they had done with MySQL:

        - Running with a debug version of our ODBC driver

        - Running on a Linux system that wasn't optimized for threads

        - Using an old MySQL version when there was a recommended newer
          one available

        - Not starting MySQL with the right options for heavy
          multi-user use (the default installation of MySQL is tuned
          for minimal resource use).

     Great Bridge did run a new test, with our optimized ODBC driver
     and with better startup options for MySQL, but refused to either
     use our updated glibc library or our standard binary (used by 80%
     of our users), which was statically linked with a fixed glibc
     library.

     According to what we know, Great Bridge did nothing to ensure that
     the other databases were set up correctly to run well in their test
     environment.  We are sure however that they didn't contact Oracle
     or Microsoft to ask for their advice in this matter ;)

   * The benchmark was paid for by Great Bridge, and they decided to
     publish only partial, chosen results (instead of publishing it
     all).

Tim Perdue, a long time PostgreSQL fan and a reluctant MySQL user
published a comparison on phpbuider
(http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20001112.php3).

When we became aware of the comparison, we phoned Tim Perdue about this
because there were a lot of strange things in his results.  For example,
he claimed that MySQL had a problem with five users in his tests, when
we know that there are users with similar machines as his that are using
MySQL with 2000 simultaneous connections doing 400 queries per second.
(In this case the limit was the web bandwidth, not the database.)

It sounded like he was using a Linux kernel that either had some
problems with many threads, such as kernels before 2.4, which had a
problem with many threads on multi-CPU machines. We have documented in
this manual how to fix this and Tim should be aware of this problem.

The other possible problem could have been an old glibc library and
that Tim didn't use a MySQL binary from our site, which is linked with
a corrected glibc library, but had compiled a version of his own with.
In any of the above cases, the symptom would have been exactly what Tim
had measured.

We asked Tim if we could get access to his data so that we could repeat
the benchmark and if he could check the MySQL version on the machine to
find out what was wrong and he promised to come back to us about this.
He has not done that yet.

Because of this we can't put any trust in this benchmark either :(

Over time things also changes and the above benchmarks are not that
relevant anymore.  MySQL now have a couple of different table handlers
with different speed/concurrency tradeoffs.  *Note Table types::. It
would be interesting to see how the above tests would run with the
different transactional table types in MySQL.  PostgreSQL has of course
also got new features since the test was made.  As the above test are
not publicly available there is no way for us to know how the database
would preform in the same tests today.

Conclusion:

The only benchmarks that exist today that anyone can download and run
against MySQL and PostgreSQL is the MySQL benchmarks.  We here at MySQL
believe that open source databases should be tested with open source
tools!  This is the only way to ensure that no one does tests that
nobody can reproduce and use this to claim that a database is better
than another.  Without knowing all the facts it's impossible to answer
the claims of the tester.

The thing we find strange is that every test we have seen about
PostgreSQL, that is impossible to reproduce, claims that PostgreSQL is
better in most cases while our tests, which anyone can reproduce,
clearly shows otherwise.  With this we don't want to say that PostgreSQL
isn't good at many things (it is!) or that it isn't faster than MySQL
under certain conditions.  We would just like to see a fair test where
they are very good so that we could get some friendly competition going!

We are working on an even better benchmark suite, including multi user
tests, and a better documentation of what the individual tests really
do and how to add more tests to the suite.

File: mysql.info,  Node: TODO MySQL 4.0,  Next: TODO future,  Prev: TODO,  Up: TODO

Things that should be in 4.0
----------------------------

We plan to make MySQL Version 4.0 a "quick" release where we only add
some new stuff to enable others to help us with developing new features
into Version 4.1.  The MySQL 4.0 version should only take us about a
month to make after which we want to stabilize it and start working on
Version 4.1.  Version 4.0 should have the following new features:

The news section for 4.0 includes a list of the features we have already
implemented in the 4.0 tree. *Note News-4.0.x::.

   * New table definition file format (`.frm' files) This will enable us
     to not run out of bits when adding more table options.  One will
     still be able to use the old `.frm' file format with 4.0.  All
     newly created tables will, however, use the new format.

     The new file format will enable us to add new column types, more
     options for keys and `FOREIGN KEY' support.

   * `mysqld' as a library.  This will have the same interface as the
     standard MySQL client (with an extra function to just set up
     startup parameters) but will be faster (no TCP/IP or socket
     overhead), smaller and much easier to use for embedded products.

     One will be able to define at link time if one wants to use the
     client/server model or a stand-alone application just by defining
     which library to link with.

     The `mysqld' will support all standard MySQL features and one can
     use it in a threaded client to run different queries in each
     thread.

   * Replication should work with `RAND()' and user variables `@var'.

   * Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online
     backup will make it easy to add a new replication slave without
     taking down the master.

   * `DELETE FROM table_name' will return the number of deleted rows.
     For fast execution one should use `TRUNCATE table_name'.

   * Allow `DELETE' on `MyISAM' tables to use the record cache.  To do
     this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
     the `.MYD' file.

   * Better replication.

   * More functions for full-text search.  *Note Fulltext Features to
     Appear in MySQL 4.0::.

   * Character set casts and syntax for handling multiple character
     sets.

   * Allow users to change startup options without taking down the
     server.

   * Help for all commands from the client.

   * Secure connections (with SSL).

   * Extend the optimizer to be able to optimize some `ORDER BY
     key_name DESC' queries.

   * `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name' (used by `mysql' client to allow
     expansions of column names) should not open the table, but only the
     definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.

   * New key cache

   * When using `SET CHARACTER SET' we should translate the whole query
     at once and not only strings. This will enable users to use the
     translated characters in database, table and column names.

   * Add a portable interface over `gethostbyaddr_r()' so that we can
     change `ip_to_hostname()' to not block other threads while doing
     DNS lookups.

   * Add `record_in_range()' method to `MERGE' tables to be able to
     choose the right index when there is many to choose from. We should
     also extend the info interface to get the key distribution for
     each index, of `analyze' is run on all sub tables.

   * `SET SQL_DEFAULT_TABLE_TYPE=[MyISAM | INNODB | BDB | HEAP]'.

Things that must be done in the real near future
------------------------------------------------

   * Fail safe replication.

   * Subqueries.  `select id from t where grp in (select grp from g
     where u > 100)'

   * Derived tables.
          select a.col1, b.col2 from (select max(col1) as col1 from root_table ) a,
          other_table b where a.col1=b.col1

     This could be done by automatically creating temporary tables for
     the derived tables for the duration of the query.

   * Add `PREPARE' of statements and sending of parameters to `mysqld'.

   * Extend the server/client protocol to support warnings.

   * Add options to the server/protocol protocol to get progress notes
     for long running commands.

   * Add database and real table name (in case of alias) to the
     MYSQL_FIELD structure.

   * Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run MyISAM
     recover at the same time.

   * Change `INSERT ... SELECT' to optionally use concurrent inserts.

   * Implement `RENAME DATABASE'. To make this safe for all table
     handlers, it should work as follows:
        * Create the new database.

        * For every table do a rename of the table to another database,
          as we do with the `RENAME' command.

        * Drop the old database.

   * Return the original field types() when doing `SELECT MIN(column)
     ... GROUP BY'.

   * Multiple result sets.

   * Change the protocol to allow binary transfer of values. To do this
     efficiently, we need to add an API to allow binding of variables.

   * Make it possible to specify `long_query_time' with a granularity
     in microseconds.

   * Add a configurable prompt to the `mysql' command line client, with
     options like database in use, time and date...

   * Add range checking to `MERGE' tables.

   * Link the `myisampack' code into the server.

   * Port of MySQL to BeOS.

   * Port of the MySQL clients to LynxOS.

   * Add a temporary key buffer cache during `INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE' so
     that we can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.

   * If you perform an `ALTER TABLE' on a table that is symlinked to
     another disk, create temporary tables on this disk.

   * Implement a `DATE/DATETIME' type that handles time zone information
     properly, so that dealing with dates in different time zones is
     easier.

   * FreeBSD and MIT-pthreads;  Do sleeping threads take CPU?

   * Check if locked threads take any CPU.

   * Fix configure so that one can compile all libraries (like `MyISAM')
     without threads.

   * Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with
     delayed keys if they haven't been used in a while.

   * Allow join on key parts (optimization issue).

   * `INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT' and `mysqld --concurrent-insert' to do a
     concurrent insert at the end of the file if the file is
     read-locked.

   * Remember `FOREIGN' key definitions in the `.frm' file.

   * Cascading `DELETE'

   * Server side cursors.

   * Check if `lockd' works with modern Linux kernels; If not, we have
     to fix `lockd'!  To test this, start `mysqld' with
     `--enable-locking' and run the different fork* test suits. They
     shouldn't give any errors if `lockd' works.

   * Allow SQL variables in `LIMIT', like in `LIMIT @a,@b'.

   * Allow update of variables in `UPDATE' statements. For example:
     `UPDATE TABLE foo SET @a=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c'

   * Change when user variables are updated so that one can use them
     with `GROUP BY', as in the following example: `SELECT id,
     @a:=count(*), sum(sum_col)/@a FROM table_name GROUP BY id'.

   * Don't add automatic `DEFAULT' values to columns.  Give an error
     when using an `INSERT' that doesn't contain a column that doesn't
     have a `DEFAULT'.

   * Caching of queries and results. This should be done as a separated
     module that examines each query and if this is query is in the
     cache the cached result should be returned.  When one updates a
     table one should remove as few queries as possible from the cache.
     This should give a big speed bost on machines with much RAM where
     queries are often repeated (like WWW applications).  One idea
     would be to only cache queries of type: `SELECT CACHED ...'

   * Fix `libmysql.c' to allow two `mysql_query()' commands in a row
     without reading results or give a nice error message when one does
     this.

   * Optimize `BIT' type to take 1 bit (now `BIT' takes 1 char).

   * Check why MIT-pthreads `ctime()' doesn't work on some FreeBSD
     systems.

   * Add an `IMAGE' option to `LOAD DATA INFILE' to not update
     `TIMESTAMP' and `AUTO_INCREMENT' fields.

   * Added `LOAD DATE INFILE.. UPDATE' syntax.
        * For tables with primary keys, if the data contains the
          primary key, entries matching that primary key are updated
          from the remainder of the columns. However, columns MISSING
          from the incoming data feed are not touched.

        * For tables tables with primary keys that are missing some
          part of the key in the incoming data stream, or that have no
          primary key, the feed is treated as a `LOAD DATA INFILE ...
          REPLACE INTO' is now.

   * Make `LOAD DATA INFILE' understand syntax like:
          LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
          TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3)
          SET table_field1=concatenate(text_field1, text_field2), table_field3=23
          IGNORE text_field3
          
          This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file, or update columns
          based on expressions of the read data...

   * `LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' INTO TABLE 'table_name' ERRORS TO
     err_table_name' This would cause any errors and warnings to be
     logged into the err_table_name table. That table would have a
     structure like:

          line_number    - line number in data file
          error_message  - the error/warning message
          and maybe
          data_line      - the line from the data file

   * Add true `VARCHAR' support (There is already support for this in
     MyISAM).

   * Automatic output from `mysql' to netscape.

   * `LOCK DATABASES'. (with various options)

   * Change sort to allocate memory in "hunks" to get better memory
     utilization.

   * `DECIMAL' and `NUMERIC' types can't read exponential numbers;
     `Field_decimal::store(const char *from,uint len)' must be recoded
     to fix this.

   * Functions: ADD_TO_SET(value,set) and REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set)

   * Add use of `t1 JOIN t2 ON ...' and `t1 JOIN t2 USING ...'
     Currently, you can only use this syntax with `LEFT JOIN'.

   * Add full support for `unsigned long long' type.

   * Many more variables for `show status'.  Counts for:
     `INSERT'/`DELETE'/`UPDATE' statements. Records reads and updated.
     Selects on 1 table and selects with joins.  Mean number of tables
     in select. Number of `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' queries.

   * If you abort `mysql' in the middle of a query, you should open
     another connection and kill the old running query.  Alternatively,
     an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.

   * Add a handler interface for table information so you can use it as
     a system table. This would be a bit slow if you requested
     information about all tables, but very flexible.  `SHOW INFO FROM
     tbl_name' for basic table information should be implemented.

   * Add support for UNICODE.

   * `NATURAL JOIN' and `UNION JOIN'

   * Allow `select a from crash_me left join crash_me2 using (a)'; In
     this case a is assumed to come from the crash_me table.

   * Fix that `ON' and `USING' works with the `JOIN' join type.

   * Oracle like `CONNECT BY PRIOR ...' to search hierarchy structures.

   * `mysqladmin copy database new-database'. - Requires COPY command
     to be added to `mysqld'

   * Processlist should show number of queries/thread.

   * `SHOW HOSTS' for printing information about the hostname cache.

   * `DELETE' and `REPLACE' options to the `UPDATE' statement (this
     will delete rows when one gets a duplicate key error while
     updating).

   * Change the format of `DATETIME' to store fractions of seconds.

   * Add all missing ANSI92 and ODBC 3.0 types.

   * Change table names from empty strings to `NULL' for calculated
     columns.

   * Don't use 'Item_copy_string' on numerical values to avoid
     number->string->number conversion in case of: `SELECT
     COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM table_name GROUP BY id'

   * Make it possible to use the new GNU regexp library instead of the
     current one (The GNU library should be much faster than the old
     one).

   * Change that `ALTER TABLE' doesn't abort clients that executes
     `INSERT DELAYED'.

   * Fix that when columns referenced in an `UPDATE' clause contains
     the old values before the update started.

   * `myisamchk', `REPAIR' and `OPTIMIZE TABLE' should be able to
     handle cases where the data and/or index files are symbolic links.

   * Add simulation of `pread()'/`pwrite()' on Windows to enable
     concurrent inserts.

   * A logfile analyzer that could parsed out information about which
     tables are hit most often, how often multi-table joins are
     executed, etc.  It should help users identify areas or table
     design that could be optimized to execute much more efficient
     queries.

   * Add `SUM(DISTINCT)'

   * Add `ANY()',`EVERY()' and `SOME()' group functions. In ANSI SQL
     these only works on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
     work on any columns/expressions by applying: value == 0 -> FALSE
     and value <> 0 -> TRUE.

   * Fix that the type for `MAX(column)' is the same as the column type.
          create table t1 (a DATE);
          insert into t1 values (now());
          create table t2 select max(a) from t1;
          show columns from t2;

   * Come up with a nice syntax for a statement that will `UPDATE' the
     row if it exists and `INSERT' a new row if the row didn't exist.
     (Like `REPLACE' works with `INSERT' / `DELETE')


File: mysql.info,  Node: TODO sometime,  Next: TODO unplanned,  Prev: TODO future,  Up: TODO

Things that have to be done sometime
------------------------------------

   * Implement function: `get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)'

   * Atomic multi-table updates, eg `update items,month set
     items.price=month.price where items.id=month.id;';

   * Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only
     compressed tables use memmap.

   * Add a new privilege *'Show_priv'* for `SHOW' commands.

   * Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the
     update log with `SET TIMESTAMP=#;'

   * Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.

   * Full foreign key support. One probably wants to implement a
     procedural language first.

   * Simple views (first on one table, later on any expression).

   * Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table or
     temporary files gets error 23 (not enough open files).

   * When one finds a field=#, change all occurrences of field to #.
     Now this is only done for some simple cases.

   * Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if
     possible.

   * Optimize key = expression. At the moment only key = field or key =
     constant are optimized.

   * Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.

   * Change `sql_yacc.yy' to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
     better error messages (5 days).

   * Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of
     arguments in function.

   * Use of full calculation names in the order part. (For ACCESS97)

   * `UNION', `MINUS', `INTERSECT' and `FULL OUTER JOIN'.  (Currently
     only `LEFT OUTER JOIN' is supported)

   * Allow `UNIQUE' on fields that can be `NULL'.

   * `SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#' to put a time limit on a query.

   * Make the update log to a database.

   * Negative `LIMIT' to retrieve data from the end.

   * Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.

   * Please note the changes to `safe_mysqld': according to FSSTND
     (which Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into
     `/var/run/<progname>.pid' and log files into `/var/log'. It would
     be nice if you could put the "DATADIR" in the first declaration of
     "pidfile" and "log", so the placement of these files can be
     changed with a single statement.

   * Allow a client to request logging.

   * Add use of `zlib()' for `gzip'-ed files to `LOAD DATA INFILE'.

   * Fix sorting and grouping of `BLOB' columns (partly solved now).

   * Stored procedures.  This is currently not regarded to be very
     important as stored procedures are not very standardized yet.
     Another problem is that true stored procedures make it much harder
     for the optimizer and in many cases the result is slower than
     before We will, on the other hand, add a simple (atomic) update
     language that can be used to write loops and such in the MySQL
     server.

   * Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first
     implement a semaphore library to MIT-pthreads.

   * Don't assign a new `AUTO_INCREMENT' value when one sets a column
     to 0.  Use `NULL' instead.

   * Add full support for `JOIN' with parentheses.

   * As an alternative for one thread / connection manage a pool of
     threads to handle the queries.

   * Allow one to get more than one lock with `GET_LOCK'.  When doing
     this, one must also handle the possible deadlocks this change will
     introduce.

Time is given according to amount of work, not real time.

     compliant.

Quick Standard Installation of MySQL
====================================

* Menu:

* Linux-RPM::                   Installing MySQL on Linux
* Windows installation::        Installing MySQL on Windows


File: mysql.info,  Node: Linux-RPM,  Next: Windows installation,  Prev: Quick Standard Installation,  Up: Quick Standard Installation

Installing MySQL on Linux
-------------------------

The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using an RPM file.
The MySQL RPMs are currently being built on a RedHat Version 6.2 system
but should work on other versions of Linux that support `rpm' and use
`glibc'.

If you have problems with an RPM file, for example, if you receive the
error "`Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up'", see *Note
Binary notes-Linux::.

The RPM files you may want to use are:

   * `MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
     connect to a MySQL server running on another machine.

   * `MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
     install this package.

   * `MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and msql-mysql-modules RPMs.

   * `MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     Libraries and include files needed if you want to compile other
     MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

   * `MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm'

     This contains the source code for all of the above packages. It
     can also be used to try to build RPMs for other architectures (for
     example, Alpha or SPARC).

To see all files in an RPM package, run:
     shell> rpm -qpl MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm

To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

     shell> rpm -i MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm

To install just the client package, run:

     shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm

The RPM places data in `/var/lib/mysql'. The RPM also creates the
appropriate entries in `/etc/rc.d/' to start the server automatically
at boot time.  (This means that if you have performed a previous
installation, you may want to make a copy of your previously installed
MySQL startup file if you made any changes to it, so you don't lose
your changes.)

After installing the RPM file(s), the `mysqld' daemon should be running
and you should now be able to start using MySQL.  *Note
Post-installation::.

If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary
installation chapter. *Note Installing binary::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Windows installation,  Prev: Linux-RPM,  Up: Quick Standard Installation

Installing MySQL on Windows
---------------------------

The following instructions apply to precompiled binary distributions.
If you download a source distribution, you will have to compile and
install it yourself.

If you don't have a copy of the MySQL distribution, you should first
download one from `http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html'.

If you plan to connect to MySQL from some other program, you will
probably also need the *MyODBC* driver. You can find this at the
*MyODBC* download page
(`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html').

To install either distribution, unzip it in some empty directory and
run the `Setup.exe' program.

By default, MySQL-Windows is configured to be installed in `C:\mysql'.
If you want to install MySQL elsewhere, install it in `C:\mysql' first,
then move the installation to where you want it.  If you do move MySQL,
you must indicate where everything is located by supplying a
`--basedir' option when you start the server.  For example, if you have
moved the MySQL distribution to `D:\programs\mysql', you must start
`mysqld' like this:

     C:\> D:\programs\mysql\bin\mysqld --basedir D:\programs\mysql

Use `mysqld --help' to display all the options that `mysqld'
understands!

With all newer MySQL versions, you can also create a `C:\my.cnf' file
that holds any default options for the MySQL server.  Copy the file
`\mysql\my-xxxxx.cnf' to `C:\my.cnf' and edit it to suit your setup.
Note that you should specify all paths with `/' instead of `\'. If you
use `\', you need to specify it twice, because `\' is the escape
character in MySQL.  *Note Option files::.

Starting with MySQL 3.23.38, the Windows distribution includes both the
normal and the *MySQL-Max* binaries.  The main benefit of using the
normal `mysqld.exe' binary is that it's a little faster and uses less
resources.

Here is a list of the different MySQL servers you can use:

`mysqld'            Compiled with full debugging and automatic memory
                   allocation checking, symbolic links, BDB and InnoDB
                   tables.
`mysqld-opt'        Optimized binary with no support for transactional
                   tables.
`mysqld-nt'         Optimized binary for NT with support for named
                   pipes. You can run this version on Win98, but in this
                   case no named pipes are created and you must have
                   TCP/IP installed.
`mysqld-max'        Optimized binary with support for symbolic links,
                   BDB and InnoDB tables.
`mysqld-max-nt'     Like `mysqld-max', but compiled with support for
                   named pipes.

Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is
started with `--enable-named-pipe'.

All of the above binaries are optimized for the Pentium Pro processor
but should work on any Intel processor >= i386.

NOTE: If you want to use InnoDB tables, there are certain startup
options that must be specified in your `my.ini' file! *Note InnoDB
start::.

Operating Systems Supported by MySQL
------------------------------------

We use GNU Autoconf, so it is possible to port MySQL to all modern
systems with working Posix threads and a C++ compiler.  (To compile
only the client code, a C++ compiler is required but not threads.)  We
use and develop the software ourselves primarily on Sun Solaris
(Versions 2.5 - 2.7) and SuSE Linux Version 7.x.

Note that for many operating systems, the native thread support works
only in the latest versions. MySQL has been reported to compile
successfully on the following operating system/thread package
combinations:

   * AIX 4.x with native threads.  *Note IBM-AIX::.

   * Amiga.

   * BSDI 2.x with the included MIT-pthreads package.  *Note BSDI::.

   * BSDI 3.0, 3.1 and 4.x with native threads.  *Note BSDI::.

   * DEC Unix 4.x with native threads.  *Note Alpha-DEC-UNIX::.

   * FreeBSD 2.x with the included MIT-pthreads package.  *Note
     FreeBSD::.

   * FreeBSD 3.x and 4.x with native threads.  *Note FreeBSD::.

   * HP-UX 10.20 with the included MIT-pthreads package.  *Note HP-UX
     10.20::.

   * HP-UX 11.x with the native threads.  *Note HP-UX 11.x::.

   * Linux 2.0+ with LinuxThreads 0.7.1+ or `glibc' 2.0.7+.  *Note
     Linux::.

   * Mac OS X Server.  *Note Mac OS X::.

   * NetBSD 1.3/1.4 Intel and NetBSD 1.3 Alpha (Requires GNU make).
     *Note NetBSD::.

   * OpenBSD > 2.5 with native therads. OpenBSD < 2.5 with the included
     MIT-pthreads package.  *Note OpenBSD::.

   * OS/2 Warp 3, FixPack 29 and OS/2 Warp 4, FixPack 4.  *Note OS/2::.

   * SGI Irix 6.x with native threads.  *Note SGI-Irix::.

   * Solaris 2.5 and above with native threads on SPARC and x86.  *Note
     Solaris::.

   * SunOS 4.x with the included MIT-pthreads package.  *Note Solaris::.

   * SCO OpenServer with a recent port of the FSU Pthreads package.
     *Note SCO::.

   * SCO UnixWare 7.0.1.  *Note SCO Unixware::.

   * Tru64 Unix

   * Win95, Win98, NT, and Win2000.  *Note Windows::.

Note that not all platforms are suited equally well for running MySQL.
How well a certain platform is suited for a high-load mission critical
MySQL server is determined by the following factors:

   * General stability of the thread library. A platform may have
     excellent reputation otherwise, but if the thread library is
     unstable in the code that is called by MySQL, even if everything
     else is perfect, MySQL will be only as stable as the thread
     library.

   * The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage
     of *SMP* on multi-processor systems. In other words, when a process
     creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to run on
     a different CPU than the original process.

   * The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many
     threads which acquire/release a mutex over a short critical region
     frequently without excessive context switches. In other words, if
     the implementation of `pthread_mutex_lock()' is too anxious to
     yield CPU, this will hurt MySQL tremendously. If this issue is not
     taken care of, adding extra CPUs will actually make MySQL slower.

   * General file system stability/performance.

   * Ability of the file system to deal with large files at all and
     deal with them efficiently, if your tables are big.

   * Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we
     know a platform well, we introduce platform-specific
     optimizations/fixes enabled at compile time. We can also provide
     advice on configuring your system optimally for MySQL.

   * The amount of testing of similar configurations we have done
     internally.

   * The number of users that have successfully run MySQL on that
     platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the
     chances of hitting some platform-specific surprise are much
     smaller.

Based on the above criteria, the best platforms for running MySQL at
this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 7.1, 2.4 kernel and ReiserFS (or any
similar Linux distribution) and Sparc with Solaris 2.7 or 2.8. FreeBSD
comes third, but we really hope it will join the top club once the
thread library is improved. We also hope that at some point we will be
able to include all other platforms on which MySQL compiles, runs ok,
but not quite with the same level of stability and performance, into
the top category. This will require some effort on our part in
cooperation with the developers of the OS/library components MySQL
depends upon. If you are interested in making one of those components
better, are in a position to influence their development, and need more
detailed instructions on what MySQL needs to run better, send an e-mail
to <internals@lists.mysql.com>.

Please note that the comparison above is not to say that one OS is
better or worse than the other in general. We are talking about
choosing a particular OS for a dedicated purpose - running MySQL, and
compare platforms in that regard only. With this in mind, the result of
this comparison would be different if we included more issues into it.
And in some cases, the reason one OS is better than the other could
simply be that we have put forth more effort into testing on and
optimizing for that particular platform.  We are just stating our
observations to help you make a decision on which platform to use MySQL
on in your setup.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Which version,  Next: Installation layouts,  Prev: Which OS,  Up: General Installation Issues

Which MySQL Version to Use
--------------------------

The first decision to make is whether you want to use the latest
development release or the last stable release:

   * Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or
     trying to port it to some system for which there is no binary
     distribution, we recommend going with the stable release (currently
     Version 3.23.51.  Note that all MySQL releases are checked with
     the MySQL benchmarks and an extensive test suite before each
     release.

   * Otherwise, if you are running an old system and want to upgrade,
     but don't want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you
     should upgrade to the latest in the same branch you are using
     (where only the last version number is newer than yours).  We have
     tried to fix only fatal bugs and make small, relatively safe
     changes to that version.

The second decision to make is whether you want to use a source
distribution or a binary distribution.  In most cases you should
probably use a binary distribution, if one exists for your platform, as
this generally will be easier to install than a source distribution.

In the following cases you probably will be better off with a source
installation:

   * If you want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  (The
     standard binary distributions are "ready to run" at any place, but
     you may want to get even more flexibility).

   * To be able to satisfy different user requirements, we are
     providing two different binary versions; One compiled with the
     non-transactional table handlers, (a small, fast binary), and one
     configured with the most important extended options like
     transaction-safe tables.  Both versions are compiled from the same
     source distribution.  All native `MySQL' clients can connect to
     both MySQL versions.

     The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the `-max'
     suffix and is configured with the same options as `mysqld-max'.
     *Note `mysqld-max': mysqld-max.

     If you want to use the `MySQL-Max' RPM, you must first install the
     standard `MySQL' RPM.

   * If you want to configure `mysqld' with some extra features that are
     NOT in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the
     most common extra options that you may want to use:

        * `--with-berkeley-db'

        * `--with-innodb'

        * `--with-raid'

        * `--with-libwrap'

        * `--with-named-z-lib  (This is done for some of the binaries)'

        * `--with-debug[=full]'

   * The default binary distribution is normally compiled with support
     for all characters sets and should work on a variety of processors
     from the same processor family.

     If you want a faster MySQL server you may want to recompile it
     with support for only the character sets you need, use a better
     compiler (like `pgcc') or use compiler options that are better
     optimized for your processor.

   * If you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL development
     team you will probably receive a patch that you need to apply to
     the source distribution to get the bug fixed.

   * If you want to read (and/or modify) the C and C++ code that makes
     up MySQL, you should get a source distribution.  The source code is
     always the ultimate manual.  Source distributions also contain more
     tests and examples than binary distributions.

The MySQL naming scheme uses release numbers that consist of three
numbers and a suffix.  For example, a release name like
`mysql-3.21.17-beta' is interpreted like this:

   * The first number (`3') describes the file format.  All Version 3
     releases have the same file format.

   * The second number (`21') is the release level.  Normally there are
     two to choose from. One is the release/stable branch (currently
     `23') and the other is the development branch (currently `4.0').
     Normally both are stable, but the development version may have
     quirks, missing documentation on new features, or may fail to
     compile on some systems.

   * The third number (`17') is the version number within the release
     level.  This is incremented for each new distribution.  Usually you
     want the latest version for the release level you have chosen.

   * The suffix (`beta') indicates the stability level of the release.
     The possible suffixes are:

        - `alpha' indicates that the release contains some large
          section of new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs
          (usually there are none) should be documented in the News
          section.  *Note News::.  There are also new commands and
          extensions in most alpha releases.  Active development that
          may involve major code changes can occur on an alpha release,
          but everything will be tested before doing a release.  There
          should be no known bugs in any MySQL release.

        - `beta' means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
          features that could cause corruption on old code are added.
          There should be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha
          to beta when there haven't been any reported fatal bugs
          within an alpha version for at least a month and we don't
          plan to add any features that could make any old command more
          unreliable.

        - `gamma' is a beta that has been around a while and seems to
          work fine.  Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many
          other companies call a release.

        - If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run
          for a while at many different sites with no reports of bugs
          other than platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes
          are applied to the release. This is what we call a stable
          release.

All versions of MySQL are run through our standard tests and benchmarks
to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the standard
tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

Note that all releases have been tested at least with:

An internal test suite
     This is part of a production system for a customer.  It has many
     tables with hundreds of megabytes of data.

The MySQL benchmark suite
     This runs a range of common queries.  It is also a test to see
     whether the latest batch of optimizations actually made the code
     faster.  *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

The `crash-me' test
     This tries to determine what features the database supports and
     what its capabilities and limitations are.  *Note MySQL
     Benchmarks::.

Another test is that we use the newest MySQL version in our internal
production environment, on at least one machine.  We have more than 100
gigabytes of data to work with.

Installation Layouts
--------------------

This section describes the default layout of the directories created by
installing binary and source distributions.

A binary distribution is installed by unpacking it at the installation
location you choose (typically `/usr/local/mysql') and creates the
following directories in that location:

*Directory*            *Contents of directory*
`bin'                  Client programs and the `mysqld' server
`data'                 Log files, databases
`include'              Include (header) files
`lib'                  Libraries
`scripts'              `mysql_install_db'
`share/mysql'          Error message files
`sql-bench'            Benchmarks

A source distribution is installed after you configure and compile it.
By default, the installation step installs files under `/usr/local', in
the following subdirectories:

*Directory*            *Contents of directory*
`bin'                  Client programs and scripts
`include/mysql'        Include (header) files
`info'                 Documentation in Info format
`lib/mysql'            Libraries
`libexec'              The `mysqld' server
`share/mysql'          Error message files
`sql-bench'            Benchmarks and `crash-me' test
`var'                  Databases and log files

Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation
differs from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

   * The `mysqld' server is installed in the `libexec' directory rather
     than in the `bin' directory.

   * The data directory is `var' rather than `data'.

   * `mysql_install_db' is installed in the `/usr/local/bin' directory
     rather than in `/usr/local/mysql/scripts'.

   * The header file and library directories are `include/mysql' and
     `lib/mysql' rather than `include' and `lib'.

You can create your own binary installation from a compiled source
distribution by executing the script `scripts/make_binary_distribution'.

How and When Updates Are Released
---------------------------------

MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we want to share
this with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release when we have
very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended e-mail supported customers
want and try to help them out.

No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  *Note News::.

We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

   * For each minor update, the last number in the version string is
     incremented.  When there are major new features or minor
     incompatibilities with previous versions, the second number in the
     version string is incremented.  When the file format changes, the
     first number is increased.

   * Stable tested releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a year,
     but if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes will be
     released.

   * Working releases are meant to appear about every 1-8 weeks.

   * Binary distributions for some platforms will be made by us for
     major releases.  Other people may make binary distributions for
     other systems but probably less frequently.

   * We usually make patches available as soon as we have located and
     fixed small bugs.

   * For non-critical but annoying bugs, we will make patches available
     if they are sent to us.  Otherwise we will combine many of them
     into a larger patch.

   * If there is, by any chance, a fatal bug in a release we will make
     a new release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies
     to do this, too.

The current stable release is Version 3.23; We have already moved active
development to Version 4.0.  Bugs will still be fixed in the stable
version.  We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves
out bug fixes and things that "must be done."  "Somewhat frozen" means
that we may add small things that "almost surely will not affect
anything that's already working."

Installing a MySQL Source Distribution
======================================

Before you proceed with the source installation, check first to see if
our binary is available for your platform and if it will work for you.
We put in a lot of effort into making sure that our binaries are built
with the best possible options.

You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution.  GNU `tar' is known
     to work.  Sun `tar' is known to have problems.

   * A working ANSI C++ compiler.  `gcc' >= 2.95.2, `egcs' >= 1.0.2 or
     `egcs 2.91.66', SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the compilers
     that are known to work.  `libg++' is not needed when using `gcc'.
     `gcc' 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible to compile some
     perfectly legal C++ files, such as `sql/sql_base.cc'.  If you only
     have `gcc' 2.7.x, you must upgrade your `gcc' to be able to
     compile MySQL. `gcc' 2.8.1 is also known to have problems on some
     platforms so it should be avoided if there exists a new compiler
     for the platform..

     `gcc' >= 2.95.2 is recommended when compiling MySQL Version 3.23.x.

   * A good `make' program.  GNU `make' is always recommended and is
     sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
     `make' 3.75 or newer.

If you are using a recent version of *gcc*, recent enough to understand
`-fno-exceptions' option, it is *VERY IMPORTANT* that you use it.
Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use `-felide-contructors' and `-fno-rtti' along with
`-fno-exceptions'. When in doubt, do the following:


     CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

On most systems this will give you a fast and stable binary.

If you run into problems, *PLEASE ALWAYS USE `mysqlbug'* when posting
questions to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.  Even if the problem isn't a bug,
`mysqlbug' gathers system information that will help others solve your
problem.  By not using `mysqlbug', you lessen the likelihood of getting
a solution to your problem!  You will find `mysqlbug' in the `scripts'
directory after you unpack the distribution.  *Note Bug reports::.

Quick Installation Overview
---------------------------

The basic commands you must execute to install a MySQL source
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
     shell> cd mysql-VERSION
     shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
     shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
     shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
     shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
     shell> /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

If you want have support for InnoDB tables, you should edit the
`/etc/my.cnf' file and remove the `#' character before the parameters
that starts with `innodb_...'. *Note Option files::. *Note InnoDB
start::.

If you start from a source RPM, then do the following:

     shell> rpm --rebuild MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm

This will make a binary RPM that you can install.

You can add new users using the `bin/mysql_setpermission' script if you
install the `DBI' and `Msql-Mysql-modules' Perl modules.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a source distribution, follow the steps below, then proceed
to *Note Post-installation::, for post-installation initialization and
testing:

  1. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it.

  2. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

  3. If you are interested in using Berkeley DB tables with MySQL, you
     will need to obtain a patched version of the Berkeley DB source
     code.  Please read the chapter on Berkeley DB tables before
     proceeding.  *Note BDB::.

     MySQL source distributions are provided as compressed `tar'
     archives and have names like `mysql-VERSION.tar.gz', where
     `VERSION' is a number like 3.23.51.

  4. Add a user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group, and the `mysql' user.  The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix.  They may also be called `adduser' and
     `addgroup'.  You may wish to call the user and group something
     else instead of `mysql'.

  5. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -

     This command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION'.

  6. Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

          shell> cd mysql-VERSION

     Note that currently you must configure and build MySQL from this
     top-level directory.  You can not build it in a different
     directory.

  7. Configure the release and compile everything:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> make

     When you run `configure', you might want to specify some options.
     Run `./configure --help' for a list of options.  *Note `configure'
     options: configure options, discusses some of the more useful
     options.

     If `configure' fails, and you are going to send mail to
     <mysql@lists.mysql.com> to ask for assistance, please include any
     lines from `config.log' that you think can help solve the problem.
     Also include the last couple of lines of output from `configure'
     if `configure' aborts.  Post the bug report using the `mysqlbug'
     script.  *Note Bug reports::.

     If the compile fails, see *Note Compilation problems::, for help
     with a number of common problems.

  8. Install everything:

          shell> make install

     You might need to run this command as `root'.

  9. Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
     installed MySQL before):

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
     MySQL server when you run `mysql_install_db'.  This is no longer
     true!

 10. Change ownership of binaries to `root' and ownership of the data
     directory to the user that you will run `mysqld' as:

          shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
          shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/var
          shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql

     The first command changes the `owner' attribute of the files to the
     `root' user, the second one changes the `owner' attribute of the
     data directory to the `mysql' user, and the third one changes the
     `group' attribute to the `mysql' group.

 11. If you want to install support for the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' interface,
     see *Note Perl support::.

 12. If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files.  More information can be
     found in the `support-files/mysql.server' script itself and in
     *Note Automatic start::.

After everything has been installed, you should initialize and test your
distribution:

     shell> /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

If that command fails immediately with `mysqld daemon ended' then you
can find some information in the file
`mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'.  The likely reason is that you
already have another `mysqld' server running.  *Note Multiple servers::.

*Note Post-installation::.

Applying Patches
----------------

Sometimes patches appear on the mailing list or are placed in the
patches area (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches) of the MySQL Web
site.

To apply a patch from the mailing list, save the message in which the
patch appears in a file, change into the top-level directory of your
MySQL source tree, and run these commands:

     shell> patch -p1 < patch-file-name
     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> make clean

Patches from the FTP site are distributed as plain text files or as
files compressed with `gzip'.  Apply a plain patch as shown above for
mailing list patches.  To apply a compressed patch, change into the
top-level directory of your MySQL source tree and run these commands:

     shell> gunzip < patch-file-name.gz | patch -p1
     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> make clean

After applying a patch, follow the instructions for a normal source
install, beginning with the `./configure' step.  After running the `make
install' step, restart your MySQL server.

You may need to bring down any currently running server before you run
`make install'.  (Use `mysqladmin shutdown' to do this.)  Some systems
do not allow you to install a new version of a program if it replaces
the version that is currently executing.


File: mysql.info,  Node: configure options,  Next: Installing source tree,  Prev: Applying patches,  Up: Installing source

Typical `configure' Options
---------------------------

The `configure' script gives you a great deal of control over how you
configure your MySQL distribution.  Typically you do this using options
on the `configure' command line.  You can also affect `configure' using
certain environment variables.  *Note Environment variables::.  For a
list of options supported by `configure', run this command:

     shell> ./configure --help

Some of the more commonly-used `configure' options are described below:

   * To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
     not the server, use the `--without-server' option:

          shell> ./configure --without-server

     If you don't have a C++ compiler, `mysql' will not compile (it is
     the one client program that requires C++).  In this case, you can
     remove the code in `configure' that tests for the C++ compiler and
     then run `./configure' with the `--without-server' option. The
     compile step will still try to build `mysql', but you can ignore
     any warnings about `mysql.cc'.  (If `make' stops, try `make -k' to
     tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors
     occur.)

   * If you don't want your log files and database directories located
     under `/usr/local/var', use a `configure' command, something like
     one of these:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                     --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data

     The first command changes the installation prefix so that
     everything is installed under `/usr/local/mysql' rather than the
     default of `/usr/local'.  The second command preserves the default
     installation prefix, but overrides the default location for
     database directories (normally `/usr/local/var') and changes it to
     `/usr/local/mysql/data'.

   * If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located
     somewhere other than the default location (normally in the
     directory `/tmp' or `/var/run') use a `configure' command like
     this:

          shell> ./configure --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock

     Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname!  You can
     also later change the location `mysql.sock' by using the MySQL
     option files. *Note Problems with mysql.sock::.

   * If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to
     make a binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around
     problems with some RedHat Linux distributions), run `configure'
     like this:

          shell> ./configure --with-client-ldflags=-all-static \
                     --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

   * If you are using `gcc' and don't have `libg++' or `libstdc++'
     installed, you can tell `configure' to use `gcc' as your C++
     compiler:

          shell> CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure

     When you use `gcc' as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to
     link in `libg++' or `libstdc++'.

     Here is some common environment variables to set depending on the
     compiler you are using:

     gcc 2.7.2.1    CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors"
     egcs 1.0.3a    CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors
                   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"
     gcc 2.95.2     CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3
                   -mpentiumpro -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions
                   -fno-rtti"
     pgcc 2.90.29   CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double"
     or newer      CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro
                   -mstack-align-double -felide-constructors
                   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"

     In most cases you can get a reasonably optimal MySQL binary by
     using the options from the above and adding the following options
     to the configure line:

          --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The full configure line would in other words be something like the
     following for all recent gcc versions:

          CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The binaries we provide on the MySQL Web site at
     `http://www.mysql.com' are all compiled with full optimization and
     should be perfect for most users.  *Note MySQL binaries::.  There
     are some things you can tweak to make an even faster binary, but
     this is only for advanced users.  *Note Compile and link options::.

     If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or
     linker not being able to create the shared library
     `libmysqlclient.so.#' (`#' is a version number), you can work
     around this problem by giving the `--disable-shared' option to
     `configure'.  In this case, `configure' will not build a shared
     `libmysqlclient.so.#' library.

   * You can configure MySQL not to use `DEFAULT' column values for
     non-`NULL' columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be
     `NULL').  This causes `INSERT' statements to generate an error
     unless you explicitly specify values for all columns that require a
     non-`NULL' value.  To suppress use of default values, run
     `configure' like this:

          shell> CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS ./configure

   * By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
     change the default set, use the `--with-charset' option:
          shell> ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
     `CHARSET' may be one of `big5', `cp1251', `cp1257', `czech',
     `danish', `dec8', `dos', `euc_kr', `gb2312', `gbk', `german1',
     `hebrew', `hp8', `hungarian', `koi8_ru', `koi8_ukr', `latin1',
     `latin2', `sjis', `swe7', `tis620', `ujis', `usa7', or
     `win1251ukr'.  *Note Character sets::.

     If you want to convert characters between the server and the
     client, you should take a look at the `SET OPTION CHARACTER SET'
     command.  *Note `SET OPTION': SET OPTION.

     *Warning:* If you change character sets after having created any
     tables, you will have to run `myisamchk -r -q' on every table. Your
     indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if
     you install MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure MySQL to
     use a different character set and reinstall it.)

     With the option `--with-extra-charset=LIST' you can define which
     additional character sets should be incompiled in the server.

     Here `LIST' is either a list of character set separated with space,
     `complex' to include all characters that can't be dynamically
     loaded or `all' to include all character sets into the binaries.

   * To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the `--with-debug'
     option:
          shell> ./configure --with-debug
     This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find
     some errors and that provides output about what is happening.
     *Note Debugging server::.

   * If your client programs are using threads, you need to also
     compile a thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
     `--enable-thread-safe-client' configure options. This will create a
     `libmysqlclient_r' library with which you should link your threaded
     applications.  *Note Threaded clients::.

   * Options that pertain to particular systems can be found in the
     system-specific section of this manual.  *Note Operating System
     Specific Notes::.

Installing from the Development Source Tree
-------------------------------------------

*CAUTION:* You should read this section only if you are interested in
helping us test our new code. If you just want to get MySQL up and
running on your system, you should use a standard release distribution
(either a source or binary distribution will do).

To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these
instructions:

  1. Download *BitKeeper* from
     `http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi'.  You will need
     *Bitkeeper* 2.0 or newer to access our repository.

  2. Follow the instructions to install it.

  3. After *BitKeeper* is installed, use this command if you want to
     clone the MySQL 3.23 branch:

          shell> bk clone bk://work.mysql.com:7000 mysql

     To clone the 4.0 branch, use this command instead:

          shell> bk clone bk://work.mysql.com:7001 mysql-4.0

     The initial download of the source tree may take a while,
     depending on the speed of your connection; be patient.

  4. You will need GNU `autoconf', `automake', `libtool', and `m4' to
     run the next set of commands.  If you get some strange error
     during this stage, check that you really have `libtool' installed!

          shell> cd mysql
          shell> bk -r edit
          shell> aclocal; autoheader; autoconf;  automake;
          shell> ./configure  # Add your favorite options here
          shell> make

     A collection of our standard configure scripts is located in the
     `BUILD/' subdirectory.  If you are lazy, you can use
     `BUILD/compile-pentium-debug'. To compile on a different
     architecture, modify the script removing flags that are
     Pentium-specific.

  5. When the build is done, run `make install'.  Be careful with this
     on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live
     release installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL,
     we recommand that you run `./configure' with different values for
     the `prefix', `tcp-port', and `unix-socket-path' options than
     those used for your production server.

  6. Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new
     features crash.  Start by running `make test'.  *Note MySQL test
     suite::.

  7. If you have gotten to the `make' stage and the distribution does
     not compile, please report it to <bugs@lists.mysql.com>.  If you
     have installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and
     they crash trying to process our configuration files, please
     report that also.  However, if you execute `aclocal' and get a
     `command not found' error or a similar problem, do not report it.
     Instead, make sure all the necessary tools are installed and that
     your `PATH' variable is set correctly so your shell can find them.

  8. After the initial `bk clone' operation to get the source tree, you
     should run `bk pull' periodically to get the updates.

  9. You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs
     by using `bk sccstool'.  If you see some funny diffs or code that
     you have a question about, do not hesitate to send e-mail to
     <internals@lists.mysql.com>.  Also, if you think you have a better
     idea on how to do something, send an email to the same address
     with a patch.  `bk diffs' will produce a patch for you after you
     have made changes to the source. If you do not have the time to
     code your idea, just send a description.

 10. *BitKeeper* has a nice help utility that you can access via `bk
     helptool'.



File: mysql.info,  Node: Compilation problems,  Next: MIT-pthreads,  Prev: Installing source tree,  Up: Installing source

Problems Compiling?
-------------------

All MySQL programs compile cleanly for us with no warnings on Solaris
using `gcc'.  On other systems, warnings may occur due to differences
in system include files.  See *Note MIT-pthreads:: for warnings that
may occur when using MIT-pthreads.  For other problems, check the list
below.

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring.  If you do need to
reconfigure, take note of the following:

   * If `configure' is run after it already has been run, it may use
     information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This
     information is stored in `config.cache'.  When `configure' starts
     up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on
     the assumption that the information is still correct.  That
     assumption is invalid when you reconfigure.

   * Each time you run `configure', you must run `make' again to
     recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from
     previous builds first, because they were compiled using different
     configuration options.

To prevent old configuration information or object files from being
used, run these commands before rerunning `configure':

     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> make clean

Alternatively, you can run `make distclean'.

The list below describes some of the problems compiling MySQL that have
been found to occur most often:

   * If you get errors when compiling `sql_yacc.cc', such as the ones
     shown below, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:

          Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
            or
          Out of virtual memory
            or
          Virtual memory exhausted

     The problem is that `gcc' requires huge amounts of memory to
     compile `sql_yacc.cc' with inline functions.  Try running
     `configure' with the `--with-low-memory' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-low-memory

     This option causes `-fno-inline' to be added to the compile line
     if you are using `gcc' and `-O0' if you are using something else.
     You should try the `--with-low-memory' option even if you have so
     much memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have
     run out.  This problem has been observed to occur even on systems
     with generous hardware configurations, and the `--with-low-memory'
     option usually fixes it.

   * By default, `configure' picks `c++' as the compiler name and GNU
     `c++' links with `-lg++'.  If you are using `gcc', that behavior
     can cause problems during configuration such as this:

          configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
          C++ compiler cannot create executables.

     You might also observe problems during compilation related to
     `g++', `libg++', or `libstdc++'.

     One cause of these problems is that you may not have `g++', or you
     may have `g++' but not `libg++', or `libstdc++'.  Take a look at
     the `config.log' file.  It should contain the exact reason why
     your c++ compiler didn't work!  To work around these problems, you
     can use `gcc' as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment
     variable `CXX' to `"gcc -O3"'.  For example:

          shell> CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure

     This works because `gcc' compiles C++ sources as well as `g++'
     does, but does not link in `libg++' or `libstdc++' by default.

     Another way to fix these problems, of course, is to install `g++',
     `libg++' and `libstdc++'.

   * If your compile fails with errors, such as any of the following,
     you must upgrade your version of `make' to GNU `make':

          making all in mit-pthreads
          make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
          Badly formed macro assignment
            or
          make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:
            or
          pthread.h: No such file or directory

     Solaris and FreeBSD are known to have troublesome `make' programs.

     GNU `make' Version 3.75 is known to work.

   * If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers,
     do so by adding the flags to the `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS'
     environment variables.  You can also specify the compiler names
     this way using `CC' and `CXX'.  For example:

          shell> CC=gcc
          shell> CFLAGS=-O3
          shell> CXX=gcc
          shell> CXXFLAGS=-O3
          shell> export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS

     See *Note MySQL binaries::, for a list of flag definitions that
     have been found to be useful on various systems.

   * If you get an error message like this, you need to upgrade your
     `gcc' compiler:

          client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'

     `gcc' 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using `gcc' 2.95.2
     or `egcs' 1.0.3a instead.

   * If you get errors such as those shown below when compiling
     `mysqld', `configure' didn't correctly detect the type of the last
     argument to `accept()', `getsockname()', or `getpeername()':

          cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
               type of the pointer value "&length" is "unsigned long", which
               is not compatible with "int".
          new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&cAddr, &length);

     To fix this, edit the `config.h' file (which is generated by
     `configure').  Look for these lines:

          /* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
          #define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX

     Change `XXX' to `size_t' or `int', depending on your operating
     system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
     `configure', because `configure' regenerates `config.h'.)

   * The `sql_yacc.cc' file is generated from `sql_yacc.yy'.  Normally
     the build process doesn't need to create `sql_yacc.cc', because
     MySQL comes with an already-generated copy.  However, if you do
     need to re-create it, you might encounter this error:

          "sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...

     This is a sign that your version of `yacc' is deficient.  You
     probably need to install `bison' (the GNU version of `yacc') and
     use that instead.

   * If you need to debug `mysqld' or a MySQL client, run `configure'
     with the `--with-debug' option, then recompile and link your
     clients with the new client library.  *Note Debugging client::.

MIT-pthreads Notes
------------------

This section describes some of the issues involved in using
MIT-pthreads.

Note that on Linux you should NOT use MIT-pthreads but install
LinuxThreads!  *Note Linux::.

If your system does not provide native thread support, you will need to
build MySQL using the MIT-pthreads package.  This includes older
FreeBSD systems, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.4 and earlier, and some others.
*Note Which OS::.

   * On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
     `configure' with the `--with-mit-threads' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-mit-threads

     Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
     MIT-pthreads, because we want to minimize our changes to this code.

   * The checks that determine whether or not to use MIT-pthreads occur
     only during the part of the configuration process that deals with
     the server code.  If you have configured the distribution using
     `--without-server' to build only the client code, clients will not
     know whether or not MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix
     socket connections by default.  Because Unix sockets do not work
     under MIT-pthreads, this means you will need to use `-h' or
     `--host' when you run client programs.

   * When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
     disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the
     server to use system locking with the `--use-locking' option.

   * Sometimes the pthread `bind()' command fails to bind to a socket
     without any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is
     that all connections to the server fail.  For example:

          shell> mysqladmin version
          mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
          error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'

     The solution to this is to kill the `mysqld' server and restart it.
     This has only happened to us when we have forced the server down
     and done a restart immediately.

   * With MIT-pthreads, the `sleep()' system call isn't interruptible
     with `SIGINT' (break).  This is only noticeable when you run
     `mysqladmin --sleep'.  You must wait for the `sleep()' call to
     terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

   * When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at
     least on Solaris); they can be ignored:

          ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
          ld: warning: symbol `__iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken

   * Some other warnings also can be ignored:

          implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
          implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'

   * We haven't gotten `readline' to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This
     isn't needed, but may be interesting for someone.)

Post-installation Setup and Testing
===================================

* Menu:

* mysql_install_db::            Problems running `mysql_install_db'
* Starting server::             Problems starting the MySQL server
* Automatic start::             Starting and stopping MySQL automatically

Once you've installed MySQL (from either a binary or source
distribution), you need to initialize the grant tables, start the
server, and make sure that the server works okay.  You may also wish to
arrange for the server to be started and stopped automatically when
your system starts up and shuts down.

Normally you install the grant tables and start the server like this
for installation from a source distribution:

     shell> ./scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
     shell> ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

For a binary distribution (not RPM or pkg packages), do this:

     shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
     shell> ./bin/mysql_install_db
     shell> ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

This creates the `mysql' database which will hold all database
privileges, the `test' database which you can use to test MySQL and
also privilege entries for the user that run `mysql_install_db' and a
`root' user (without any passwords).  This also starts the `mysqld'
server.

`mysql_install_db' will not overwrite any old privilege tables, so it
should be safe to run in any circumstances.  If you don't want to have
the `test' database you can remove it with `mysqladmin -u root drop
test'.

Testing is most easily done from the top-level directory of the MySQL
distribution.  For a binary distribution, this is your installation
directory (typically something like `/usr/local/mysql').  For a source
distribution, this is the main directory of your MySQL source tree.

In the commands shown below in this section and in the following
subsections, `BINDIR' is the path to the location in which programs
like `mysqladmin' and `safe_mysqld' are installed.  For a binary
distribution, this is the `bin' directory within the distribution.  For
a source distribution, `BINDIR' is probably `/usr/local/bin', unless
you specified an installation directory other than `/usr/local' when
you ran `configure'.  `EXECDIR' is the location in which the `mysqld'
server is installed.  For a binary distribution, this is the same as
`BINDIR'.  For a source distribution, `EXECDIR' is probably
`/usr/local/libexec'.

Testing is described in detail below:

  1. If necessary, start the `mysqld' server and set up the initial
     MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
     users are allowed to connect to the server.  This is normally done
     with the `mysql_install_db' script:

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Typically, `mysql_install_db' needs to be run only the first time
     you install MySQL.  Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
     installation, you can skip this step.  (However,
     `mysql_install_db' is quite safe to use and will not update any
     tables that already exist, so if you are unsure of what to do, you
     can always run `mysql_install_db'.)

     `mysql_install_db' creates six tables (`user', `db', `host',
     `tables_priv', `columns_priv', and `func') in the `mysql'
     database.  A description of the initial privileges is given in
     *Note Default privileges::.  Briefly, these privileges allow the
     MySQL `root' user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or
     use databases with a name of `'test'' or starting with `'test_''.

     If you don't set up the grant tables, the following error will
     appear in the log file when you start the server:

          mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'

     The above may also happen with a binary MySQL distribution if you
     don't start MySQL by executing exactly `./bin/safe_mysqld'!  *Note
     `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

     You might need to run `mysql_install_db' as `root'.  However, if
     you prefer, you can run the MySQL server as an unprivileged
     (non-`root') user, provided that user can read and write files in
     the database directory.  Instructions for running MySQL as an
     unprivileged user are given in *Note Changing MySQL user: Changing
     MySQL user.

     If you have problems with `mysql_install_db', see *Note
     `mysql_install_db': mysql_install_db.

     There are some alternatives to running the `mysql_install_db'
     script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:

        * You may want to edit `mysql_install_db' before running it, to
          change the initial privileges that are installed into the
          grant tables.  This is useful if you want to install MySQL on
          a lot of machines with the same privileges.  In this case you
          probably should need only to add a few extra `INSERT'
          statements to the `mysql.user' and `mysql.db' tables!

        * If you want to change things in the grant tables after
          installing them, you can run `mysql_install_db', then use
          `mysql -u root mysql' to connect to the grant tables as the
          MySQL `root' user and issue SQL statements to modify the
          grant tables directly.

        * It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after
          they have already been created.  You might want to do this if
          you've already installed the tables but then want to
          re-create them after editing `mysql_install_db'.

     For more information about these alternatives, see *Note Default
     privileges::.

  2. Start the MySQL server like this:

          shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
          shell> bin/safe_mysqld &

     If you have problems starting the server, see *Note Starting
     server::.

  3. Use `mysqladmin' to verify that the server is running.  The
     following commands provide a simple test to check that the server
     is up and responding to connections:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin version
          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin variables

     The output from `mysqladmin version' varies slightly depending on
     your platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that
     shown below:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin version
          mysqladmin  Ver 8.14 Distrib 3.23.32, for linux on i586
          Copyright (C) 2000 MySQL AB & MySQL Finland AB & TCX DataKonsult AB

          and you are welcome to modify and redistribute it under the GPL license

     To get a feeling for what else you can do with `BINDIR/mysqladmin',
     invoke it with the `--help' option.

  4. Verify that you can shut down the server:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin -u root shutdown

  5. Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this using
     `safe_mysqld' or by invoking `mysqld' directly.  For example:

          shell> BINDIR/safe_mysqld --log &

     If `safe_mysqld' fails, try running it from the MySQL installation
     directory (if you are not already there).  If that doesn't work,
     see *Note Starting server::.

  6. Run some simple tests to verify that the server is working.  The
     output should be similar to what is shown below:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqlshow
          +-----------+
          | Databases |
          +-----------+
          | mysql     |
          +-----------+
          
          shell> BINDIR/mysqlshow mysql
          Database: mysql
          +--------------+
          |    Tables    |
          +--------------+
          | columns_priv |
          | db           |
          | func         |
          | host         |
          | tables_priv  |
          | user         |
          +--------------+
          
          shell> BINDIR/mysql -e "select host,db,user from db" mysql
          +------+--------+------+
          | host | db     | user |
          +------+--------+------+
          | %    | test   |      |
          | %    | test_% |      |
          +------+--------+------+

     There is also a benchmark suite in the `sql-bench' directory
     (under the MySQL installation directory) that you can use to
     compare how MySQL performs on different platforms.  The
     `sql-bench/Results' directory contains the results from many runs
     against different databases and platforms.  To run all tests,
     execute these commands:

          shell> cd sql-bench
          shell> run-all-tests

     If you don't have the `sql-bench' directory, you are probably
     using an RPM for a binary distribution.  (Source distribution RPMs
     include the benchmark directory.)  In this case, you must first
     install the benchmark suite before you can use it.  Beginning with
     MySQL Version 3.22, there are benchmark RPM files named
     `mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm' that contain benchmark code and
     data.

     If you have a source distribution, you can also run the tests in
     the `tests' subdirectory. For example, to run
     `auto_increment.tst', do this:

          shell> BINDIR/mysql -vvf test < ./tests/auto_increment.tst

     The expected results are shown in the `./tests/auto_increment.res'
     file.

Problems Running `mysql_install_db'
-----------------------------------

The purpose of the `mysql_install_db' script is to generate new MySQL
privilege tables.  It will not affect any other data!  It will also not
do anything if you already have MySQL privilege tables installed!

If you want to re-create your privilege tables, you should take down
the `mysqld' server, if it's running, and then do something like:

     mv mysql-data-directory/mysql mysql-data-directory/mysql-old
     mysql_install_db

This section lists problems you might encounter when you run
`mysql_install_db':

*`mysql_install_db' doesn't install the grant tables*
     You may find that `mysql_install_db' fails to install the grant
     tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:

          starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
          mysql daemon ended

     In this case, you should examine the log file very carefully!  The
     log should be located in the directory `XXXXXX' named by the error
     message, and should indicate why `mysqld' didn't start.  If you
     don't understand what happened, include the log when you post a
     bug report using `mysqlbug'!  *Note Bug reports::.

*There is already a `mysqld' daemon running*
     In this case, you probably don't have to run `mysql_install_db' at
     all.  You have to run `mysql_install_db' only once, when you
     install MySQL the first time.

*Installing a second `mysqld' daemon doesn't work when one daemon is running*
     This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL
     installation, but want to put a new installation in a different
     place (for example, for testing, or perhaps you simply want to run
     two installations at the same time).  Generally the problem that
     occurs when you try to run the second server is that it tries to
     use the same socket and port as the old one.  In this case you
     will get the error message: `Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP
     port: Address already in use' or `Can't start server : Bind on
     unix socket...'. *Note Installing many servers::.

*You don't have write access to `/tmp'*
     If you don't have write access to create a socket file at the
     default place (in `/tmp') or permission to create temporary files
     in `/tmp,' you will get an error when running `mysql_install_db'
     or when starting or using `mysqld'.

     You can specify a different socket and temporary directory as
     follows:

          shell> TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
          shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysqld.sock
          shell> export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT

     *Note Problems with mysql.sock::.

     `some_tmp_dir' should be the path to some directory for which you
     have write permission. *Note Environment variables::.

     After this you should be able to run `mysql_install_db' and start
     the server with these commands:

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
          shell> BINDIR/safe_mysqld &

*`mysqld' crashes immediately*
     If you are running RedHat Version 5.0 with a version of `glibc'
     older than 2.0.7-5, you should make sure you have installed all
     `glibc' patches!  There is a lot of information about this in the
     MySQL mail archives.  Links to the mail archives are available
     online at `http://www.mysql.com/documentation/'.  Also, see *Note
     Linux::.

     You can also start `mysqld' manually using the
     `--skip-grant-tables' option and add the privilege information
     yourself using `mysql':

          shell> BINDIR/safe_mysqld --skip-grant-tables &
          shell> BINDIR/mysql -u root mysql

     From `mysql', manually execute the SQL commands in
     `mysql_install_db'.  Make sure you run `mysqladmin
     flush-privileges' or `mysqladmin reload' afterward to tell the
     server to reload the grant tables.

Problems Starting the MySQL Server
----------------------------------

If you are going to use tables that support transactions (BDB, InnoDB),
you should first create a my.cnf file and set startup options for the
table types you plan to use. *Note Table types::.

Generally, you start the `mysqld' server in one of three ways:

   * By invoking `mysql.server'.  This script is used primarily at
     system startup and shutdown, and is described more fully in *Note
     Automatic start::.

   * By invoking `safe_mysqld', which tries to determine the proper
     options for `mysqld' and then runs it with those options. *Note
     `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

   * On NT you should install `mysqld' as a service as follows:
          bin\mysqld-nt --install               # Install MySQL as a service

     You can now start/stop `mysqld' as follows:
          NET START mysql
          NET STOP mysql

     Note that in this case you can't use any other options for
     `mysqld'!

     You can remove the service as follows:
          bin\mysqld-nt --remove                # remove MySQL as a service

   * By invoking `mysqld' directly.

When the `mysqld' daemon starts up, it changes directory to the data
directory.  This is where it expects to write log files and the pid
(process ID) file, and where it expects to find databases.

The data directory location is hardwired in when the distribution is
compiled.  However, if `mysqld' expects to find the data directory
somewhere other than where it really is on your system, it will not work
properly.  If you have problems with incorrect paths, you can find out
what options `mysqld' allows and what the default path settings are by
invoking `mysqld' with the `--help' option.  You can override the
defaults by specifying the correct pathnames as command-line arguments
to `mysqld'.  (These options can be used with `safe_mysqld' as well.)

Normally you should need to tell `mysqld' only the base directory under
which MySQL is installed.  You can do this with the `--basedir' option.
You can also use `--help' to check the effect of changing path options
(note that `--help' _must_ be the final option of the `mysqld'
command).  For example:

     shell> EXECDIR/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --help

Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
the `--help' option.

Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically `/usr/local/mysql/data'
for a binary distribution, `/usr/local/var' for a source distribution,
`\mysql\data\mysql.err' on Windows.)  Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form `host_name.err' and `host_name.log' where
`host_name' is the name of your server host.  Then check the last few
lines of these files:

     shell> tail host_name.err
     shell> tail host_name.log

If you find something like the following in the log file:
     000729 14:50:10  bdb:  Recovery function for LSN 1 27595 failed
     000729 14:50:10  bdb:  warning: ./test/t1.db: No such file or directory
     000729 14:50:10  Can't init databases

This means that you didn't start `mysqld' with `--bdb-no-recover' and
Berkeley DB found something wrong with its log files when it tried to
recover your databases.  To be able to continue, you should move away
the old Berkeley DB log file from the database directory to some other
place, where you can later examine these.  The log files are named
`log.0000000001', where the number will increase over time.

If you are running `mysqld' with BDB table support and `mysqld' core
dumps at start this could be because of some problems with the BDB
recover log.  In this case you can try starting `mysqld' with
`--bdb-no-recover'.  If this helps, then you should remove all `log.*'
files from the data directory and try starting `mysqld' again.

If you get the following error, it means that some other program (or
another `mysqld' server) is already using the TCP/IP port or socket
`mysqld' is trying to use:

     Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
       or
     Can't start server : Bind on unix socket...

Use `ps' to make sure that you don't have another `mysqld' server
running.  If you can't find another server running, you can try to
execute the command `telnet your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number' and press
`RETURN' a couple of times.  If you don't get an error message like
`telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused',
something is using the TCP/IP port `mysqld' is trying to use.  See
*Note mysql_install_db:: and *Note Multiple servers::.

If `mysqld' is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

     shell> mysqladmin variables

or

     shell> mysqladmin -h 'your-host-name' variables

If `safe_mysqld' starts the server but you can't connect to it, you
should make sure you have an entry in `/etc/hosts' that looks like this:

     127.0.0.1       localhost

This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

If you can't get `mysqld' to start you can try to make a trace file to
find the problem. *Note Making trace files::.

If you are using InnoDB tables, refer to the InnoDB-specific startup
options.  *Note InnoDB start::.

If you are using BDB (Berkeley DB) tables, you should familiarize
yourself with the different BDB specific startup options.  *Note BDB
start::.

Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically
-----------------------------------------

The `mysql.server' and `safe_mysqld' scripts can be used to start the
server automatically at system startup time. `mysql.server' can also be
used to stop the server.

The `mysql.server' script can be used to start or stop the server by
invoking it with `start' or `stop' arguments:

     shell> mysql.server start
     shell> mysql.server stop

`mysql.server' can be found in the `share/mysql' directory under the
MySQL installation directory or in the `support-files' directory of the
MySQL source tree.

Before `mysql.server' starts the server, it changes directory to the
MySQL installation directory, then invokes `safe_mysqld'.  You might
need to edit `mysql.server' if you have a binary distribution that
you've installed in a non-standard location.  Modify it to `cd' into
the proper directory before it runs `safe_mysqld'. If you want the
server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate `user' line to
the `/etc/my.cnf' file, as shown later in this section.

`mysql.server stop' brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can take down the server manually by executing `mysqladmin
shutdown'.

You might want to add these start and stop commands to the appropriate
places in your `/etc/rc*' files when you start using MySQL for
production applications.  Note that if you modify `mysql.server', then
upgrade MySQL sometime, your modified version will be overwritten, so
you should make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.

If your system uses `/etc/rc.local' to start external scripts, you
should append the following to it:
     /bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql ; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &'

You can also add options for `mysql.server' in a global `/etc/my.cnf'
file.  A typical `/etc/my.cnf' file might look like this:

     [mysqld]
     datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
     socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
     port=3306
     user=mysql
     
     [mysql.server]
     basedir=/usr/local/mysql

The `mysql.server' script understands the following options: `datadir',
`basedir', and `pid-file'.

The following table shows which option groups each of the startup
scripts read from option files:

*Script*       *Option groups*
`mysqld'       `mysqld' and `server'
`mysql.server' `mysql.server', `mysqld', and `server'
`safe_mysqld'  `mysql.server', `mysqld', and `server'

*Note Option files::.

Upgrading/Downgrading MySQL
===========================

You can always move the MySQL form and data files between different
versions on the same architecture as long as you have the same base
version of MySQL. The current base version is 3. If you change the
character set when running MySQL (which may also change the sort
order), you must run `myisamchk -r -q' on all tables.  Otherwise your
indexes may not be ordered correctly.

If you are afraid of new versions, you can always rename your old
`mysqld' to something like `mysqld'-'old-version-number'.  If your new
`mysqld' then does something unexpected, you can simply shut it down
and restart with your old `mysqld'!

When you do an upgrade you should also back up your old databases, of
course.

If after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client
programs, like `Commands out of sync' or unexpected core dumps, you
probably have used an old header or library file when compiling your
programs.  In this case you should check the date for your `mysql.h'
file and `libmysqlclient.a' library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs!

If you get some problems that the new `mysqld' server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, check that you don't
have some old `my.cnf' file from your old installation!  You can check
this with: `program-name --print-defaults'.  If this outputs anything
other than the program name, you have an active `my.cnf' file that will
affect things!

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the `Msql-Mysql-modules'
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL, particularly
if you notice symptoms such as all your `DBI' scripts dumping core
after you upgrade MySQL.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Upgrading-from-3.22,  Next: Upgrading-from-3.21,  Prev: Upgrade,  Up: Upgrade

Upgrading From Version 3.22 to Version 3.23
-------------------------------------------

MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new `MyISAM' type and the old
`ISAM' type.  You don't have to convert your old tables to use these
with Version 3.23.  By default, all new tables will be created with
type `MyISAM' (unless you start `mysqld' with the
`--default-table-type=isam' option). You can change an `ISAM' table to
a `MyISAM' table with `ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM' or the Perl
script `mysql_convert_table_format'.

Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a
Version 3.23 server.

The following lists tell what you have to watch out for when upgrading
to Version 3.23:

   * All tables that uses the `tis620' character set must be fixed with
     `myisamchk -r' or `REPAIR TABLE'.

   * If you do a `DROP DATABASE' on a symbolic linked database, both the
     link and the original database is deleted.  (This didn't happen in
     3.22 because configure didn't detect the `readlink' system call).

   * `OPTIMIZE TABLE' now only works for *MyISAM* tables.  For other
     table types, you can use `ALTER TABLE' to optimize the table.
     During `OPTIMIZE TABLE' the table is now locked from other threads.

   * The MySQL client `mysql' is now by default started with the option
     `--no-named-commands (-g)'. This option can be disabled with
     `--enable-named-commands (-G)'. This may cause incompatibility
     problems in some cases, for example in SQL scripts that use named
     commands without a semicolon!  Long format commands still work
     from the first line.

   * If you are using the `german' character sort order, you must repair
     all your tables with `isamchk -r', as we have made some changes in
     the sort order!

   * The default return type of `IF' will now depend on both arguments
     and not only the first argument.

   * `AUTO_INCREMENT' will not work with negative numbers. The reason
     for this is that negative numbers caused problems when wrapping
     from -1 to 0.  `AUTO_INCREMENT' is now for MyISAM tables handled
     at a lower level and is much faster than before. For MyISAM tables
     old numbers are also not reused anymore, even if you delete some
     rows from the table.

   * `CASE', `DELAYED', `ELSE', `END', `FULLTEXT', `INNER', `RIGHT',
     `THEN' and `WHEN' are now reserved words.

   * `FLOAT(X)' is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a
     fixed number of decimals.

   * When declaring `DECIMAL(length,dec)' the length argument no longer
     includes a place for the sign or the decimal point.

   * A `TIME' string must now be of one of the following formats:
     `[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]' or
     `[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]'

   * `LIKE' now compares strings using the same character comparison
     rules as `'=''.  If you require the old behavior, you can compile
     MySQL with the `CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER' flag.

   * `REGEXP' is now case insensitive for normal (not binary) strings.

   * When you check/repair tables you should use `CHECK TABLE' or
     `myisamchk' for `MyISAM' tables (`.MYI') and `isamchk' for ISAM
     (`.ISM') tables.

   * If you want your `mysqldump' files to be compatible between MySQL
     Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the `--opt' or
     `--full' option to `mysqldump'.

   * Check all your calls to `DATE_FORMAT()' to make sure there is a
     `%' before each format character.  (Later MySQL Version 3.22 did
     allow this syntax.)

   * `mysql_fetch_fields_direct' is now a function (it was a macro) and
     it returns a pointer to a `MYSQL_FIELD' instead of a `MYSQL_FIELD'.

   * `mysql_num_fields()' can no longer be used on a `MYSQL*' object
     (it's now a function that takes `MYSQL_RES*' as an argument. You
     should now use `mysql_field_count()' instead.

   * In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of `SELECT DISTINCT ...' was
     almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use `GROUP BY' or
     `ORDER BY' to obtain sorted output.

   * `SUM()' now returns `NULL', instead of 0, if there is no matching
     rows. This is according to ANSI SQL.

   * An `AND' or `OR' with `NULL' values will now return `NULL' instead
     of 0. This mostly affects queries that use `NOT' on an `AND/OR'
     expression as `NOT NULL' = `NULL'.  `LPAD()' and `RPAD()' will
     shorten the result string if it's longer than the length argument.

Upgrading from Version 3.21 to Version 3.22
-------------------------------------------

Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between Version 3.21 and
3.22.  The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with `DATE'
type columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't access
these new fields from an old version of `mysqld'.

After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the `GRANT' command.  If you forget
this, you will get `Access denied' when you try to use `ALTER TABLE',
`CREATE INDEX', or `DROP INDEX'. If your MySQL root user requires a
password, you should give this as an argument to
`mysql_fix_privilege_tables'.

The C API interface to `mysql_real_connect()' has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a `0' for
the new `db' argument (or recode the client to send the `db' element
for faster connections).  You must also call `mysql_init()' before
calling `mysql_real_connect()'!  This change was done to allow the new
`mysql_options()' function to save options in the `MYSQL' handler
structure.

The `mysqld' variable `key_buffer' has changed names to
`key_buffer_size', but you can still use the old name in your startup
files.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Upgrading-from-3.20,  Next: Upgrading-to-arch,  Prev: Upgrading-from-3.21,  Up: Upgrade

Upgrading from Version 3.20 to Version 3.21
-------------------------------------------

If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

You can start the `mysqld' Version 3.21 server with `safe_mysqld
--old-protocol' to use it with clients from a Version 3.20 distribution.
In this case, the new client function `mysql_errno()' will not return
any server error, only `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR' (but it works for client
errors), and the server uses the old `password()' checking rather than
the new one.

If you are *NOT* using the `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld', you
will need to make the following changes:

   * All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you
     must get the new *MyODBC* 2.x driver.

   * The script `scripts/add_long_password' must be run to convert the
     `Password' field in the `mysql.user' table to `CHAR(16)'.

   * All passwords must be reassigned in the `mysql.user' table (to get
     62-bit rather than 31-bit passwords).

   * The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any
     tables.

MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new `user' table format
without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier than
Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert
the `user' table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least
Version 3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

The new client code works with a 3.20.x `mysqld' server, so if you
experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

If you are not using the `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld', old
clients will issue the error message:

     ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9

The new Perl `DBI'/`DBD' interface also supports the old `mysqlperl'
interface.  The only change you have to make if you use `mysqlperl' is
to change the arguments to the `connect()' function.  The new arguments
are: `host', `database', `user', `password' (the `user' and `password'
arguments have changed places).  *Note Perl `DBI' Class: Perl DBI Class.

The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

   * `HAVING' must now be specified before any `ORDER BY' clause.

   * The parameters to `LOCATE()' have been swapped.

   * There are some new reserved words. The most notable are `DATE',
     `TIME', and `TIMESTAMP'.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Upgrading-to-arch,  Prev: Upgrading-from-3.20,  Up: Upgrade

Upgrading to Another Architecture
---------------------------------

If you are using MySQL Version 3.23, you can copy the `.frm', `.MYI',
and `.MYD' files between different architectures that support the same
floating-point format.  (MySQL takes care of any byte swapping issues.)

The MySQL `ISAM' data and index files (`.ISD' and `*.ISM',
respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases
OS-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another machine
that has a different architecture or OS than your current machine, you
should not try to move a database by simply copying the files to the
other machine. Use `mysqldump' instead.

By default, `mysqldump' will create a file full of SQL statements.  You
can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input to
the `mysql' client.

Try `mysqldump --help' to see what options are available.  If you are
moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use `mysqldump
--opt' with the newer version to get a fast, compact dump.

The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between
two machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which
the database is located:

     shell> mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
     shell> mysqldump --opt db_name \
             | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name

If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow
network, you can use:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name
     shell> mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
             | mysql db_name

You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

     shell> mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip > db_name.contents.gz

(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these
commands there:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name
     shell> gunzip < db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name

You can also use `mysqldump' and `mysqlimport' to accomplish the
database transfer.  For big tables, this is much faster than simply
using `mysqldump'.  In the commands shown below, `DUMPDIR' represents
the full pathname of the directory you use to store the output from
`mysqldump'.

First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

     shell> mkdir DUMPDIR
     shell> mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name

Then transfer the files in the `DUMPDIR' directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL there:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
     shell> cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
     shell> mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables

Also, don't forget to copy the `mysql' database, because that's where
the grant tables (`user', `db', `host') are stored.  You may have to
run commands as the MySQL `root' user on the new machine until you have
the `mysql' database in place.

After you import the `mysql' database on the new machine, execute
`mysqladmin flush-privileges' so that the server reloads the grant table
information.

The notes below regarding *glibc* apply only to the situation when you
build MySQL yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine, in
most cases it is much better for you to just use our binary. We link
our binaries against the best patched version of *glibc* we can come up
with and with the best compiler options, in an attempt to make it
suitable for a high-load server. So if you read the text below, and are
in doubt about what you should do, try our binary first to see if it
meets your needs, and worry about your own build only after you have
discovered that our binary is not good enough. In that case, we would
appreciate a note about it, so we can build a better binary next time.
For a typical user, even for setups with a lot of concurrent
connections and/or tables exceeding 2GB limit, our binary in most cases
is the best choice.

MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old Linux
version that doesn't have `glibc2', you must install LinuxThreads
before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get LinuxThreads at
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux'.

*NOTE:* We have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and MySQL
on SMP systems; If you have a SMP system, we recommend you to upgrade
to Linux 2.4 ASAP!  Your system will be faster and more stable by doing
this!

Note that `glibc' versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have a
fatal bug in `pthread_mutex_timedwait' handling, which is used when you
do `INSERT DELAYED'.  We recommend you to not use `INSERT DELAYED'
before upgrading glibc.

If you plan to have 1000+ concurrent connections, you will need to make
some changes to LinuxThreads, recompile it, and relink MySQL against
the new `libpthread.a'.  Increase `PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX' in
`sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h' to 4096 and decrease
`STACK_SIZE' in `linuxthreads/internals.h' to 256 KB. The paths are
relative to the root of `glibc' Note that MySQL will not be stable with
around 600-1000 connections if `STACK_SIZE' is the default of 2 MB.

If you have a problem with that MySQL can't open enough files, or
connections, it may be that you haven't configured Linux to handle
enough files.

In Linux 2.2 and forwards, you can check the number of allocated file
handlers by doing:

     cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
     cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
     cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max

If you have more than 16M of memory, you should add something like the
following in your boot script (`/etc/rc/boot.local' on SuSE):

     echo 65536 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
     echo 8192 > /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
     echo 1024 > /proc/sys/fs/super-max

You can also run the above from the command line as root, but in this
case your old limits will be used next time your computer reboots.

You should also add /etc/my.cnf:

     [safe_mysqld]
     open-files-limit=8192

The above should allow MySQL to create up to 8192 connections + files.

The `STACK_SIZE' constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there
will be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but
small enough to keep the stack of some thread from running into the
global `mysqld' data.  Unfortunately, the Linux implementation of
`mmap()', as we have experimentally discovered, will successfully unmap
an already mapped region if you ask it to map out an address already in
use, zeroing out the data on the entire page, instead of returning an
error.  So, the safety of `mysqld' or any other threaded application
depends on the "gentleman" behavior of the code that creates threads.
The user must take measures to make sure the number of running threads
at any time is sufficiently low for thread stacks to stay away from the
global heap.  With `mysqld', you should enforce this "gentleman"
behavior by setting a reasonable value for the `max_connections'
variable.

If you build MySQL yourself and do not want to mess with patching
LinuxThreads, you should set `max_connections' to a value no higher
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large
heap tables, or some other things that make `mysqld' allocate a lot of
memory or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2GB patch. If you are
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
`max_connections' at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables
with lots of data.  The more you reduce `STACK_SIZE' in LinuxThreads
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend the values between
128K and 256K.

If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a
"feature" in the 2.2 kernel that penalizes a process for forking or
cloning a child in an attempt to prevent a fork bomb attack.  This will
cause MySQL not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent
clients.  On single CPU systems, we have seen this manifested in a very
slow thread creation, which means it may take a long time to connect to
MySQL (as long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it
down.  On multiple CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in
query speed as the number of clients increases.  In the process of
trying to find a solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of
our users, who claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The
patch is available here
(`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch'). We have
now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both development and
production systems.  It has significantly improved `MySQL' performance
without causing any problems and we now recommend it to our users who
are still running high-load servers on 2.2 kernels.  This issue has
been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not satisfied with the
current performance of your system, rather than patching your 2.2
kernel, it might be easier to just upgrade to 2.4, which will also give
you a nice SMP boost in addition to fixing this fairness bug.

We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2 CPU machine and found
MySQL scales MUCH better - there was virtually no slowdown on query
throughput all the way up to 1000 clients, and MySQL scaling factor (
computed as the ratio of maximum throughput to the throughput with one
client) was 180%.  We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system -
virtually no slowdown as the number of clients was increased up to
1000, and 300% scaling factor. So for a high-load SMP server we would
definitely recommend the 2.4 kernel at this point. We have discovered
that it is essential to run `mysqld' process with the highest possible
priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum performance.  This can be
done by adding `renice -20 $$' command to `safe_mysqld'. In our testing
on a 4-CPU machine, increasing the priority gave 60% increase in
throughput with 400 clients.

We are currently also trying to collect more info on how well `MySQL'
performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way systems. If you have access
such a system and have done some benchmarks, please send a mail to
<docs@mysql.com> with the results - we will include them in the manual.

There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance, especially
on SMP systems.  The implementation of mutex in LinuxThreads in
*glibc-2.1* is very bad for programs with many threads that only hold
the mutex for a short time. On an SMP system, ironic as it is, if you
link MySQL against unmodified *LinuxThreads*, removing processors from
the machine improves MySQL performance in many cases.  We have made a
patch available for *glibc 2.1.3*, linuxthreads-2.1-patch
(http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch) to
correct this behavior.

With *glibc-2.2.2* MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex,
which is much better than even the patched one in *glibc-2.1.3*. Be
warned, however, that under some conditions, the current mutex code in
*glibc-2.2.2* overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The chance of
this condition can be reduced by renicing `mysqld' process to the
highest priority. We have also been able to correct the overspin
behavior with a patch, available here
(http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch). It
combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of threads, and
stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
`linuxthreads' directory with `patch -p0
</tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch'.  We hope it will be included in some
form in to the future releases of `glibc-2.2'. In any case, if you link
against `glibc-2.2.2' you still need to correct `STACK_SIZE' and
`PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX'. We hope that the defaults will be corrected to
some more acceptable values for high-load MySQL setup in the future, so
that your own build can be reduced to `./configure; make; make install'.

We recommend that you use the above patches to build a special static
version of `libpthread.a' and use it only for statically linking
against `MySQL'. We know that the patches are safe for `MySQL' and
significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything about
other applications. If you link other applications against the patched
version of the library, or build a patched shared version and install
it on your system, you are doing it at your own risk with regard to
other applications that depend on `LinuxThreads'.

If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilties hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using
our binary will resolve them.

One known problem with the binary distribution is that with older Linux
systems that use `libc' (like RedHat 4.x or Slackware), you will get
some non-fatal problems with hostname resolution.  *Note Binary
notes-Linux::.

When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three processes
running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one thread for the
LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections, and one thread
to handle alarms and signals.

Note that the Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default
only have 1024 threads.  This means that you can only have up to 1021
connections to MySQL on an unpatched system.  The page
`http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html' contains information how to go
around this limit.

If you see a dead `mysqld' daemon process with `ps', this usually means
that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted table. *Note
Crashing::.

To get a core dump on Linux if `mysqld' dies with a SIGSEGV signal, you
can start `mysqld' with the `--core-file' option.  Note that you also
probably need to raise the `core file size' by adding `ulimit -c
1000000' to `safe_mysqld' or starting `safe_mysqld' with
`--core-file-sizes=1000000'. *Note `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

If you are linking your own MySQL client and get the error:

     ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.4: open failed: No such file or directory

When executing them, the problem can be avoided by one of the following
methods:

   * Link the client with the following flag (instead of `-Lpath'):
     `-Wl,r/path-libmysqlclient.so'.

   * Copy `libmysqclient.so' to `/usr/lib'.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable before running
     your client.

If you are using the Fujitsu compiler `(fcc / FCC)' you will have some
problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very `gcc'
oriented.

The following `configure' line should work with `fcc/FCC':

     CC=fcc CFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib -K omitfp -Kpreex -D_GNU_SOURCE -DCONST=const -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO" CXX=FCC CXXFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib  -K omitfp -K preex --no_exceptions --no_rtti -D_GNU_SOURCE -DCONST=const -Dalloca=__builtin_alloca -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO '-D_EXTERN_INLINE=static __inline'" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static --disable-shared --with-low-memory

Linux Notes for Binary Distributions
....................................

MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

The binary release is linked with `-static', which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
`-static' is slightly bigger than a dynamically linked program but also
slightly faster (3-5%).  One problem, however, is that you can't use
user-definable functions (UDFs) with a statically linked program.  If
you are going to write or use UDF functions (this is something only for
C or C++ programmers), you must compile MySQL yourself, using dynamic
linking.

If you are using a `libc'-based system (instead of a `glibc2' system),
you will probably get some problems with hostname resolving and
`getpwnam()' with the binary release. (This is because `glibc'
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to resolve hostnames
and `getpwent()', even when compiled with `-static'). In this case you
probably get the following error message when you run
`mysql_install_db':

     Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up

or the following error when you try to run `mysqld' with the `--user'
option:

     getpwnam: No such file or directory

You can solve this problem in one of the following ways:

   * Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the `tar.gz'
     distribution) and install this instead.

   * Execute `mysql_install_db --force'; This will not execute the
     `resolveip' test in `mysql_install_db'.  The downside is that you
     can't use host names in the grant tables; you must use IP numbers
     instead (except for `localhost').  If you are using an old MySQL
     release that doesn't support `--force', you have to remove the
     `resolveip' test in `mysql_install' with an editor.

   * Start `mysqld' with `su' instead of using `--user'.

The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured for the
highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest stable
compiler available.

MySQL Perl support requires Version Perl 5.004_03 or newer.

On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error `Resource temporarily
unavailable' when you do a lot of new connections to a `mysqld' server
over TCP/IP.

The problem is that Linux has a delay between when you close a TCP/IP
socket and until this is actually freed by the system.  As there is only
room for a finite number of TCP/IP slots, you will get the above error
if you try to do too many new TCP/IP connections during a small time,
like when you run the MySQL `test-connect' benchmark over TCP/IP.

We have mailed about this problem a couple of times to different Linux
mailing lists but have never been able to resolve this properly.

The only known 'fix' to this problem is to use persistent connections in
your clients or use sockets, if you are running the database server and
clients on the same machine.  We hope that the `Linux 2.4' kernel will
fix this problem in the future.

Linux x86 Notes
...............

MySQL requires `libc' Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to work with
`libc' 5.4.46.  `glibc' Version 2.0.6 and later should also work. There
have been some problems with the `glibc' RPMs from RedHat, so if you
have problems, check whether or not there are any updates!  The `glibc'
2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

On some older Linux distributions, `configure' may produce an error
like this:

     Syntax error in sched.h. Change _P to __P in the /usr/include/sched.h file.
     See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.

Just do what the error message says and add an extra underscore to the
`_P' macro that has only one underscore, then try again.

You may get some warnings when compiling; those shown below can be
ignored:

     mysqld.cc -o objs-thread/mysqld.o
     mysqld.cc: In function `void init_signals()':
     mysqld.cc:315: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to `long unsigned int'
     mysqld.cc: In function `void * signal_hand(void *)':
     mysqld.cc:346: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to `long unsigned int'

In Debian GNU/Linux, if you want MySQL to start automatically when the
system boots, do the following:

     shell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server
     shell> /usr/sbin/update-rc.d mysql.server defaults 99

`mysql.server' can be found in the `share/mysql' directory under the
MySQL installation directory or in the `support-files' directory of the
MySQL source tree.

If `mysqld' always core dumps when it starts up, the problem may be that
you have an old `/lib/libc.a'.  Try renaming it, then remove
`sql/mysqld' and do a new `make install' and try again.  This problem
has been reported on some Slackware installations.

If you get the following error when linking `mysqld', it means that
your `libg++.a' is not installed correctly:

     /usr/lib/libc.a(putc.o): In function `_IO_putc':
     putc.o(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `_IO_putc'

You can avoid using `libg++.a' by running `configure' like this:

     shell> CXX=gcc ./configure

Linux SPARC Notes
.................

In some implementations, `readdir_r()' is broken.  The symptom is that
`SHOW DATABASES' always returns an empty set.  This can be fixed by
removing `HAVE_READDIR_R' from `config.h' after configuring and before
compiling.

Some problems will require patching your Linux installation.  The patch
can be found at
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/patches/Linux-sparc-2.0.30.diff'.  This
patch is against the Linux distribution `sparclinux-2.0.30.tar.gz' that
is available at `vger.rutgers.edu' (a version of Linux that was never
merged with the official 2.0.30).  You must also install LinuxThreads
Version 0.6 or newer.

Linux Alpha Notes
.................

MySQL Version 3.23.12 is the first MySQL version that is tested on
Linux-Alpha.  If you plan to use MySQL on Linux-Alpha, you should
ensure that you have this version or newer.

We have tested MySQL on Alpha with our benchmarks and test suite, and
it appears to work nicely.  The main thing we haven't yet had time to
test is how things works with many concurrent users.

When we compiled the standard MySQL binary we are using SuSE 6.4,
kernel 2.2.13-SMP, Compaq C compiler (V6.2-504) and Compaq C++ compiler
(V6.3-005) on a Comaq DS20 machine with an Alpha EV6 processor.

You can find the above compilers at
`http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools').  By using these compilers,
instead of gcc, we get about 9-14 % better performance with MySQL.

Note that the configure line optimized the binary for the current CPU;
This means you can only use our binary if you have an Alpha EV6
processor. We also compile statically to avoid library problems.

     CC=ccc CFLAGS="-fast" CXX=cxx CXXFLAGS="-fast -noexceptions -nortti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client --with-mysqld-ldflags=-non_shared --with-client-ldflags=-non_shared

If you want to use egcs the following configure line worked for us:

     CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

   * Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with `gdb
     4.18'.  You should download and use gdb 5.0 instead!

   * If you try linking `mysqld' statically when using `gcc', the
     resulting image will core dump at start.  In other words, *DON'T*
     use `--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static' with `gcc'.

Linux PowerPC Notes
...................

MySQL should work on MkLinux with the newest `glibc' package (tested
with `glibc' 2.0.7).


File: mysql.info,  Node: Linux-MIPS,  Next: Linux-IA64,  Prev: Linux-PowerPC,  Up: Linux

Linux MIPS Notes
................

To get MySQL to work on Qube2, (Linux Mips), you need the newest
`glibc' libraries (`glibc-2.0.7-29C2' is known to work).  You must also
use the `egcs' C++ compiler (`egcs-1.0.2-9', `gcc 2.95.2' or newer).


File: mysql.info,  Node: Linux-IA64,  Prev: Linux-MIPS,  Up: Linux

Linux IA64 Notes
................

To get MySQL to compile on Linux Ia64, we use the following compile
line: Using `gcc-2.96':

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql "--with-comment=Official MySQL binary" --with-extra-charsets=complex

On Ia64 the MySQL client binaries are using shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution in some other place than
`/usr/local/mysql' you need to either modify `/etc/ld.so.conf' or add
the path to the directory where you have `libmysqlclient.so' to the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.

Starting MySQL on Windows 95 or Windows 98
..........................................

MySQL uses TCP/IP to connect a client to a server. (This will allow any
machine on your network to connect to your MySQL server.)  Because of
this, you must install TCP/IP on your machine before starting MySQL.
You can find TCP/IP on your Windows CD-ROM.

Note that if you are using an old Win95 release (for example OSR2), it's
likely that you have an old Winsock package!  MySQL requires Winsock 2!
You can get the newest Winsock from `http://www.microsoft.com/'.
Win98 has the new Winsock 2 library, so the above doesn't apply for
Win98.

To start the `mysqld' server, you should start an MS-DOS window and
type:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld

This will start `mysqld' in the background without a window.

You can kill the MySQL server by executing:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown

Note that Win95 and Win98 don't support creation of named pipes.  On
Win95 and Win98, you can only use named pipes to connect to a remote
MySQL server running on a Windows NT server host.  (The MySQL server
must also support named pipes, of course. For example, using
`mysqld-opt' under NT will not allow named pipe connections.  You
should use either `mysqld-nt' or `mysqld-max-nt'.)

If `mysqld' doesn't start, please check the `\mysql\data\mysql.err'
file to see if the server wrote any message there to indicate the cause
of the problem.  You can also try to start the server with `mysqld
--standalone';  In this case, you may get some useful information on
the screen that may help solve the problem.

The last option is to start `mysqld' with `--standalone --debug'.  In
this case `mysqld' will write a log file `C:\mysqld.trace' that should
contain the reason why `mysqld' doesn't start. *Note Making trace
files::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: NT start,  Next: Windows running,  Prev: Win95 start,  Up: Windows

Starting MySQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000
............................................

The Win95/Win98 section also applies to MySQL on NT/Win2000, with the
following differences:

To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on NT, you must install service pack 3
(or newer)!

Note that everything in the following that applies for NT also applies
for Win2000!

For NT/Win2000, the server name is `mysqld-nt'.  Normally you should
install MySQL as a service on NT/Win2000:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --install

or

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max-nt --install

(Under Windows NT, you can actually install any of the server binaries
as a service, but only those having names that end with `-nt.exe'
provide support for named pipes.)

You can start and stop the MySQL service with these commands:

     C:\> NET START mysql
     C:\> NET STOP mysql

Note that in this case you can't use any other options for `mysqld-nt'!

You can also run `mysqld-nt' as a stand-alone program on NT if you need
to start `mysqld-nt' with any options!  If you start `mysqld-nt'
without options on NT, `mysqld-nt' tries to start itself as a service
with the default service options.  If you have stopped `mysqld-nt', you
have to start it with `NET START mysql'.

The service is installed with the name `MySQL'. Once installed, it must
be started using the Services Control Manager (SCM) Utility found in the
Control Panel, or by using the `NET START MySQL' command.  If any
options are desired, they must be specified as "Startup parameters" in
the SCM utility before you start the MySQL service.  Once running,
`mysqld-nt' can be stopped using `mysqladmin', or from the SCM utility
or by using the command `NET STOP MySQL'. If you use SCM to stop
`mysqld-nt', there is a strange message from SCM about `mysqld shutdown
normally'.  When run as a service, `mysqld-nt' has no access to a
console and so no messages can be seen.

On NT you can get the following service error messages:

Permission Denied      Means that it cannot find `mysqld-nt.exe'.
Cannot Register        Means that the path is incorrect.
Failed to install      Means that the service is already installed or
service.               that the Service Control Manager is in bad state.

If you have problems installing `mysqld-nt' as a service, try starting
it with the full path:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --install

If this doesn't work, you can get `mysqld-nt' to start properly by
fixing the path in the registry!

If you don't want to start `mysqld-nt' as a service, you can start it as
follows:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --standalone

or

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --standalone --debug

The last version gives you a debug trace in `C:\mysqld.trace'.  *Note
Making trace files::.

Running MySQL on Windows
........................

MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms and named pipes on NT.
The default is to use named pipes for local connections on NT and
TCP/IP for all other cases if the client has TCP/IP installed.  The
host name specifies which protocol is used:

*Host name* *Protocol*             
NULL (none)            On NT, try named pipes first; if that doesn't
                       work, use TCP/IP. On Win95/Win98, TCP/IP is used.
.                      Named pipes
localhost              TCP/IP to current host
hostname               TCP/IP


You can force a MySQL client to use named pipes by specifying the
`--pipe' option or by specifying `.' as the host name.  Use the
`--socket' option to specify the name of the pipe.

Note that starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld
is started with with `--enable-named-pipe'.  This is because some users
have experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when one uses
named pipes.

You can test whether or not MySQL is working by executing the following
commands:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql test

If `mysqld' is slow to answer to connections on Win95/Win98, there is
probably a problem with your DNS.  In this case, start `mysqld' with
`--skip-name-resolve' and use only `localhost' and IP numbers in the
MySQL grant tables.  You can also avoid DNS when connecting to a
`mysqld-nt' MySQL server running on NT by using the `--pipe' argument
to specify use of named pipes.  This works for most MySQL clients.

There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
`mysql'            Compiled on native Windows, which offers very limited
                   text editing capabilities.
`mysqlc'           Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries,
                   which offers `readline' editing.

If you want to use `mysqlc.exe', you must copy
`C:\mysql\lib\cygwinb19.dll' to your Windows system directory
(`\windows\system' or similar place).

The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges
to all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL more
secure, you should set a password for all users and remove the row in
the `mysql.user' table that has `Host='localhost'' and `User='''.

You should also add a password for the `root' user. The following
example starts by removing the anonymous user that can be used by anyone
to access the `test' database, then sets a `root' user password:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql mysql
     mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
     mysql> QUIT
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin reload
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password your_password

After you've set the password, if you want to take down the `mysqld'
server, you can do so using this command:

     C:\> mysqladmin --user=root --password=your_password shutdown

If you are using the old shareware version of MySQL Version 3.21 under
Windows, the above command will fail with an error: `parse error near
'SET OPTION password''.  The fix is in to upgrade to the current MySQL
version, which is freely available.

With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users and change
privileges with `GRANT' and `REVOKE' commands.  *Note GRANT::.

Connecting to a Remote MySQL from Windows with SSH
..................................................

Here is a note about how to connect to get a secure connection to remote
MySQL server with SSH (by David Carlson <dcarlson@mplcomm.com>):

   * Install an SSH client on your Windows machine.  As a user, the
     best non-free one I've found is from `SecureCRT' from
     `http://www.vandyke.com/'.  Another option is `f-secure' from
     `http://www.f-secure.com/'. You can also find some free ones on
     *Google* at
     `http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/'.

   * Start your Windows SSH client.  Set `Host_Name =
     yourmysqlserver_URL_or_IP'.  Set `userid=your_userid' to log in to
     your server (probably not the same as your MySQL login/password.

   * Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (Set
     `local_port: 3306', `remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip',
     `remote_port: 3306' ) or a local forward (Set `port: 3306',
     `host: localhost', `remote port: 3306').

   * Save everything, otherwise you'll have to redo it the next time.

   * Log in to your server with SSH session you just created.

   * On your Windows machine, start some ODBC application (such as
     Access).

   * Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC
     driver the same way you normally do, EXCEPT type in `localhost'
     for the MySQL host server -- not `yourmysqlservername'.

You should now have an ODBC connection to MySQL, encrypted using SSH.

Splitting Data Across Different Disks on Windows
................................................

Beginning with MySQL Version 3.23.16, the `mysqld-max' and
`mysql-max-nt' servers in the MySQL distribution are compiled with the
`-DUSE_SYMDIR' option.  This allows you to put a database on different
disk by adding a symbolic link to it (in a manner similar to the way
that symbolic links work on Unix).

On Windows, you make a symbolic link to a database by creating a file
that contains the path to the destination directory and saving this in
the `mysql_data' directory under the filename `database.sym'.  Note
that the symbolic link will be used only if the directory
`mysql_data_dir\database' doesn't exist.

For example, if the MySQL data directory is `C:\mysql\data' and you
want to have database `foo' located at `D:\data\foo', you should create
the file `C:\mysql\data\foo.sym' that contains the text `D:\data\foo\'.
After that, all tables created in the database `foo' will be created
in `D:\data\foo'.

Note that because of the speed penalty you get when opening every table,
we have not enabled this by default even if you have compiled MySQL
with support for this. To enable symlinks you should put in your
`my.cnf' or `my.ini' file the following entry:

     [mysqld]
     use-symbolic-links

In MySQL 4.0 we will enable symlinks by default. Then you should
instead use the `skip-symlink' option if you want to disable this.

Compiling MySQL Clients on Windows
..................................

In your source files, you should include `windows.h' before you include
`mysql.h':

     #if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
     #include <windows.h>
     #endif
     #include <mysql.h>

You can either link your code with the dynamic `libmysql.lib' library,
which is just a wrapper to load in `libmysql.dll' on demand, or link
with the static `mysqlclient.lib' library.

Note that as the mysqlclient libraries are compiled as threaded
libraries, you should also compile your code to be multi-threaded!


File: mysql.info,  Node: Windows vs Unix,  Prev: Windows compiling,  Up: Windows

MySQL-Windows Compared to Unix MySQL
....................................

MySQL-Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. This version
of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding Unix version with
the following exceptions:

*Win95 and threads*
     Win95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread
     creation.  Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you
     shouldn't run `mysqld' for an extended time on Win95 if your
     server handles many connections!  WinNT and Win98 don't suffer
     from this bug.

*Concurrent reads*
     MySQL depends on the `pread()' and `pwrite()' calls to be able to
     mix `INSERT' and `SELECT'.  Currently we use mutexes to emulate
     `pread()'/`pwrite()'.  We will, in the long run, replace the file
     level interface with a virtual interface so that we can use the
     `readfile()'/`writefile()' interface on NT to get more speed.  The
     current implementation limits the number of open files MySQL can
     use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to run as many
     concurrent threads on NT as on Unix.

*Blocking read*
     MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection.  This means that:

        * A connection will not be disconnected automatically after 8
          hours, as happens with the Unix version of MySQL.

        * If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without
          killing MySQL.

        * `mysqladmin kill' will not work on a sleeping connection.

        * `mysqladmin shutdown' can't abort as long as there are
          sleeping connections.

     We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have
     figured out a nice workaround.

*UDF functions*
     For the moment, MySQL-Windows does not support user-definable
     functions.

*`DROP DATABASE'*
     You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

*Killing MySQL from the task manager*
     You can't kill MySQL from the task manager or with the shutdown
     utility in Win95.  You must take it down with `mysqladmin
     shutdown'.

*Case-insensitive names*
     Filenames are case insensitive on Windows, so database and table
     names are also case insensitive in MySQL for Windows.  The only
     restriction is that database and table names must be specified
     using the same case throughout a given statement.  *Note Name case
     sensitivity::.

*The `\' directory character*
     Pathname components in Win95 are separated by the `\' character,
     which is also the escape character in MySQL.  If you are using
     `LOAD DATA INFILE' or `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE', you must double
     the `\' character:

          mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "C:\\tmp\\skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
          mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;

     Alternatively, use Unix style filenames with `/' characters:

          mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/tmp/skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
          mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;

*`Can't open named pipe' error*
     If you use a MySQL 3.22 version on NT with the newest mysql-clients
     you will get the following error:

          error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...

     This is because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT
     by default.  You can avoid this error by using the
     `--host=localhost' option to the new MySQL clients or create an
     option file `C:\my.cnf' that contains the following information:

          [client]
          host = localhost

     Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is
     started with `--enable-named-pipe'.

*`Access denied for user' error*
     If you get the error `Access denied for user: 'some-user@unknown'
     to database 'mysql'' when accessing a MySQL server on the same
     machine, this means that MySQL can't resolve your host name
     properly.

     To fix this, you should create a file `\windows\hosts' with the
     following information:

          127.0.0.1       localhost

*`ALTER TABLE'*
     While you are executing an `ALTER TABLE' statement, the table is
     locked from usage by other threads.  This has to do with the fact
     that on Windows, you can't delete a file that is in use by another
     threads.  (In the future, we may find some way to work around this
     problem.)

*`DROP TABLE' on a table that is in use by a `MERGE' table will not work*
     The `MERGE' handler does its table mapping hidden from MySQL.
     Because Windows doesn't allow you to drop files that are open, you
     first must flush all `MERGE' tables (with `FLUSH TABLES') or drop
     the `MERGE' table before dropping the table.  We will fix this at
     the same time we introduce `VIEW's.

Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us with the
Windows release:

   * Make a single-user `MYSQL.DLL' server.  This should include
     everything in a standard MySQL server, except thread creation.
     This will make MySQL much easier to use in applications that don't
     need a true client/server and don't need to access the server from
     other hosts.

   * Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

   * Create a tool to manage registry entries for the MySQL startup
     options.  The registry entry reading is already coded into
     `mysqld.cc', but it should be recoded to be more parameter
     oriented.  The tool should also be able to update the `C:\my.cnf'
     option file if the user prefers to use that instead of the
     registry.

   * When registering `mysqld' as a service with `--install' (on NT) it
     would be nice if you could also add default options on the command
     line.  For the moment, the workaround is to list the parameters in
     the `C:\my.cnf' file instead.

   * It would be real nice to be able to kill `mysqld' from the task
     manager.  For the moment, you must use `mysqladmin shutdown'.

   * Port `readline' to Windows for use in the `mysql' command line
     tool.

   * GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (`mysql', `mysqlshow',
     `mysqladmin', and `mysqldump') would be nice.

   * It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in `net.c'
     were interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open
     threads with `mysqladmin kill' on Windows.

   * `mysqld' always starts in the "C" locale and not in the default
     locale.  We would like to have `mysqld' use the current locale for
     the sort order.

   * Implement UDF functions with `.DLL's.

   * Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement
     methods provided by Windows.


Other Windows-specific issues are described in the `README' file that
comes with the MySQL-Windows distribution.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Solaris,  Next: BSD Notes,  Prev: Windows,  Up: Operating System Specific Notes

Solaris Notes
-------------

On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris `tar' can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

     x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
     tar: directory checksum error

In this case, you must use GNU `tar' (`gtar') to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/'.

Sun native threads work only on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version
2.4 and earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.  *Note
MIT-pthreads::.

If you get the following error from configure:

     checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not run test
     programs while cross compiling

This means that you have something wrong with your compiler
installation!  In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer
version.  You may also be able to solve this problem by inserting the
following row into the `config.cache' file:

     ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=${ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'}

If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is `gcc'
2.95.2.  You can find this at `http://gcc.gnu.org/'.  Note that `egcs'
1.1.1 and `gcc' 2.8.1 don't work reliably on SPARC!

The recommended `configure' line when using `gcc' 2.95.2 is:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
     CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler

If you have a ultra sparc, you can get 4 % more performance by adding
"-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

If you have Sun Workshop (Fortre) 5.3 (or newer) compiler, you can run
`configure' like this:

     CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -xO4 -native -xstrconst -mt" \
     CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -xO4 -mt" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler

In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 6 % speedup on an Ultrasparc when
using Sun Workshop 5.3 compared to using gcc with -mcpu flags.

If you get a problem with `fdatasync' or `sched_yield', you can fix
this by adding `LIBS=-lrt' to the configure line

The following paragraph is only relevant for older compilers than
WorkShop 5.3:

You may also have to edit the `configure' script to change this line:

     #if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1

to this:

     #if !defined(__STDC__)

If you turn on `__STDC__' with the `-Xc' option, the Sun compiler can't
compile with the Solaris `pthread.h' header file.  This is a Sun bug
(broken compiler or broken include file).

If `mysqld' issues the error message shown below when you run it, you
have tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (`-mt'):

     libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held

Add `-mt' to `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS' and try again.

If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with `gcc', it
means that your `gcc' is not configured for your version of Solaris:

     shell> gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
     ./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
     ./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'

The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
`gcc' and compile it with your current `gcc' compiler!  At least for
Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of `gcc' have old, unusable
include files that will break all programs that use threads (and
possibly other programs)!

Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(`libpthreads' and `libdl'), so you can't compile MySQL with
`--static'.  If you try to do so, you will get the error:

     ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found
     
     or
     
     undefined reference to `dlopen'
     
     or
     
     cannot find -lrt

If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to `mysqld', you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

     Error in accept: Protocol error

You might try starting the server with the `--set-variable back_log=50'
option as a workaround for this. *Note Command-line options::.

If you are linking your own MySQL client, you might get the following
error when you try to execute it:

     ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#: open failed: No such file or directory

The problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

   * Link the client with the following flag (instead of `-Lpath'):
     `-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so'.

   * Copy `libmysqclient.so' to `/usr/lib'.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable before running
     your client.

When using the `--with-libwrap' configure option, you must also include
the libraries that `libwrap.a' needs:

     --with-libwrap="/opt/NUtcpwrapper-7.6/lib/libwrap.a -lnsl -lsocket

If you have problems with configure trying to link with `-lz' and you
don't have `zlib' installed, you have two options:

   * If you want to be able to use the compressed communication
     protocol, you need to get and install zlib from ftp.gnu.org.

   * Configure with `--with-named-z-libs=no'.

If you are using gcc and have problems with loading `UDF' functions
into MySQL, try adding `-lgcc' to the link line for the `UDF' function.

If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
`support-files/mysql.server' to `/etc/init.d' and create a symbolic
link to it named `/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server'.

Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes
.....................

You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

Note that MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to autodetect
new versions of Solaris and enable workarounds for the following
problems!

Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use `gcc':

     /usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
     /usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
     definition

If this occurs, you can do the following to fix the problem:

Copy `/usr/include/widec.h' to `.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include'
and change line 41 from:

     #if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint)
     
     to
     
     #if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint) && !defined(getwc)

Alternatively, you can edit `/usr/include/widec.h' directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove `config.cache' and run
`configure' again!

If you get errors like this when you run `make', it's because
`configure' didn't detect the `curses.h' file (probably because of the
error in `/usr/include/widec.h'):

     In file included from mysql.cc:50:
     /usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
     /usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'

The solution to this is to do one of the following:

   * Configure with `CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H
     ./configure'.

   * Edit `/usr/include/widec.h' as indicted above and rerun configure.

   * Remove the `#define HAVE_TERM' line from `config.h' file and run
     `make' again.

If you get a problem that your linker can't find `-lz' when linking
your client program, the problem is probably that your `libz.so' file is
installed in `/usr/local/lib'.  You can fix this by one of the
following methods:

   * Add `/usr/local/lib' to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.

   * Add a link to `libz.so' from `/lib'.

   * If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional zlib from
     your Solaris 8 CD distribution.

   * Configure MySQL with the `--with-named-z-libs=no' option.

Solaris x86 Notes
.................

On Solaris 2.8 on x86, `mysqld' will core dump if you run 'strip' in.

If you are using `gcc' or `egcs' on Solaris x86 and you experience
problems with core dumps under load, you should use the following
`configure' command:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
     CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

This will avoid problems with the `libstdc++' library and with C++
exceptions.

If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run it
with a trace file or under `gdb'.  *Note Using gdb on mysqld::.

FreeBSD Notes
.............

FreeBSD 3.x is recommended for running MySQL since the thread package
is much more integrated.

The easiest and therefor the preferred way to install is to use the
mysql-server and mysql-client ports available on
`http://www.freebsd.org'.

Using these gives you:
   * A working MySQL with all optimizations known to work on your
     version of FreeBSD enabled.

   * Automatic configuration and build.

   * Startup scripts installed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d.

   * Ability to see which files that are installed with pkg_info -L.
     And to remove them all with pkg_delete if you no longer want MySQL
     on that machine.

It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x and native
threads on Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with  native
threads on some late 2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems
shutting down `mysqld'.

The MySQL `Makefile's require GNU make (`gmake') to work.  If you want
to compile MySQL you need to install GNU `make' first.

Be sure to have your name resolver setup correct.  Otherwise you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to `mysqld'.

Make sure that the `localhost' entry in the `/etc/hosts' file is
correct (otherwise you will have problems connecting to the database).
The `/etc/hosts' file should start with a line:

     127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain

If you notice that `configure' will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  *Note MIT-pthreads::.

If you get an error from `make install' that it can't find
`/usr/include/pthreads', `configure' didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads.  This is fixed by executing these commands:

     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> ./configure --with-mit-threads

FreeBSD is also known to have a very low default file handle limit.
*Note Not enough file handles::.  Uncomment the ulimit -n section in
safe_mysqld or raise the limits for the `mysqld' user in /etc/login.conf
(and rebuild it with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf).  Also be sure you set
the appropriate class for this user in the password file if you are not
using the default (use: chpass mysqld-user-name).  *Note `safe_mysqld':
safe_mysqld.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the `TZ'
variable will probably help.  *Note Environment variables::.

To get a secure and stable system you should only use FreeBSD kernels
that are marked `-STABLE'.

response, high load, high CPU usage, and crashes.

Try using `ulimit -v 80000' and run `make' again.  If this doesn't work
and you are using `bash', try switching to `csh' or `sh'; some BSDI
users have reported problems with `bash' and `ulimit'.

If you are using `gcc', you may also use have to use the
`--with-low-memory' flag for `configure' to be able to compile
`sql_yacc.cc'.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the `TZ'
variable will probably help.  *Note Environment variables::.

BSD/OS Version 3.x Notes
........................

Upgrade to BSD/OS Version 3.1.  If that is not possible, install
BSDIpatch M300-038.

Use the following command when configuring MySQL:

     shell> env CXX=shlicc++ CC=shlicc2 \
            ./configure \
                --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
                --without-perl \
                --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock

The following is also known to work:

     shell> env CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
            ./configure \
                --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock

You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
`--skip-thread-priority' option to `mysqld'!  This will run all threads
with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

If you get the error `virtual memory exhausted' while compiling, you
should try using `ulimit -v 80000' and run `make' again.  If this
doesn't work and you are using `bash', try switching to `csh' or `sh';
some BSDI users have reported problems with `bash' and `ulimit'.

BSD/OS Version 4.x Notes
........................

BSDI Version 4.x has some thread-related bugs.  If you want to use
MySQL on this, you should install all thread-related patches.  At least
M400-023 should be installed.

On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared
libraries.  The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs,
for example, `mysqladmin'.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to
use shared libraries with the `--disable-shared' option to configure.

Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the `mysqld' binary
after a while can't open tables.  This is because some library/system
related bug causes `mysqld' to change current directory without asking
for this!

The fix is to either upgrade to 3.23.34 or after running `configure'
remove the line `#define HAVE_REALPATH' from `config.h' before running
make.

Note that the above means that you can't symbolic link a database
directories to another database directory or symbolic link a table to
another database on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is
ok).

HP-UX Notes for Binary Distributions
....................................

Some of the binary distributions of MySQL for HP-UX is distributed as
an HP depot file and as a tar file.  To use the depot file you must be
running at least HP-UX 10.x to have access to HP's software depot tools.

The HP version of MySQL was compiled on an HP 9000/8xx server under
HP-UX 10.20, and uses MIT-pthreads.  It is known to work well under
this configuration.  MySQL Version 3.22.26 and newer can also be built
with HP's native thread package.

Other configurations that may work:

   * HP 9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20+

   * HP 9000/8xx running HP-UX 10.30

The following configurations almost definitely won't work:

   * HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 10.x where x < 2

   * HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 9.x

To install the distribution, use one of the commands below, where
`/path/to/depot' is the full pathname of the depot file:

   * To install everything, including the server, client and
     development tools:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.full

   * To install only the server:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.server

   * To install only the client package:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.client

   * To install only the development tools:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.developer

The depot places binaries and libraries in `/opt/mysql' and data in
`/var/opt/mysql'. The depot also creates the appropriate entries in
`/etc/init.d' and `/etc/rc2.d' to start the server automatically at
boot time.  Obviously, this entails being `root' to install.

To install the HP-UX tar.gz distribution, you must have a copy of GNU
`tar'.

HP-UX Version 10.20 Notes
.........................

There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on HP-UX.  We
recommend that you use `gcc' instead of the HP-UX native compiler,
because `gcc' produces better code!

We recommend using gcc 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimization
flags (like -O6) as this may not be safe on HP-UX.

Note that MIT-pthreads can't be compiled with the HP-UX compiler
because it can't compile `.S' (assembler) files.

The following configure line should work:

     CFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include" CXXFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" CXX=gcc ./configure --with-pthread --with-named-thread-libs='-ldce' --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

If you are compiling `gcc' 2.95 yourself, you should NOT link it with
the DCE libraries (`libdce.a' or `libcma.a') if you want to compile
MySQL with MIT-pthreads.  If you mix the DCE and MIT-pthreads packages
you will get a `mysqld' to which you cannot connect.  Remove the DCE
libraries while you compile `gcc' 2.95!


File: mysql.info,  Node: HP-UX 11.x,  Next: IBM-AIX,  Prev: HP-UX 10.20,  Up: Other Unix Notes

HP-UX Version 11.x Notes
........................

For HP-UX Version 11.x we recommend MySQL Version 3.23.15 or later.

Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you
should install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on
HP-UX 11.0:

     PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
     PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative

This will solve a problem that one gets `EWOULDBLOCK' from `recv()' and
`EBADF' from `accept()' in threaded applications.

If you are using `gcc' 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system, you
will get the error:

     In file included from /usr/include/unistd.h:11,
                      from ../include/global.h:125,
                      from mysql_priv.h:15,
                      from item.cc:19:
     /usr/include/sys/unistd.h:184: declaration of C function ...
     /usr/include/sys/pthread.h:440: previous declaration ...
     In file included from item.h:306,
                      from mysql_priv.h:158,
                      from item.cc:19:

The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define `pthreads_atfork()'
consistently.  It has conflicting prototypes in
`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h':184 and `/usr/include/sys/pthread.h':440
(details below).

One solution is to copy `/usr/include/sys/unistd.h' into
`mysql/include' and edit `unistd.h' and change it to match the
definition in `pthread.h'.  Here's the diff:

     183,184c183,184
     <      extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(), void (*parent)(),
     <                                                void (*child)());
     ---
     >      extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(void), void (*parent)(void),
     >                                                void (*child)(void));

After this, the following configure line should work:

     CFLAGS="-fomit-frame-pointer -O3 -fpic" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

Here is some information that a HP-UX Version 11.x user sent us about
compiling MySQL with HP-UX:x compiler:

      Environment:
           proper compilers.
              setenv CC cc
              setenv CXX aCC

          cc: "/tmp/empty.c", line 1: warning 501: Empty source file.
     
       configuration:
          ./configure  --with-pthread        \
          --prefix=/source-control/mysql     \
          --with-named-thread-libs=-lpthread \
          --with-low-memory
     
         added '#define _CTYPE_INCLUDED' to include/m_ctype.h. This
         symbol is the one defined in HP's /usr/include/ctype.h:
     
          /* Don't include std ctype.h when this is included */
          #define _CTYPE_H
          #define __CTYPE_INCLUDED
          #define _CTYPE_INCLUDED
          #define _CTYPE_USING   /* Don't put names in global namespace. */

   * I had to use the compile-time flag `-D_REENTRANT' to get the
     compiler to recognize the prototype for `localtime_r'.
     Alternatively I could have supplied the prototype for
     `localtime_r'. But I wanted to catch other bugs without needing to
     run into them.  I wasn't sure where I needed it, so I added it to
     all flags.

   * The optimization flags used by MySQL (-O3) are not recognized by
     HP's compilers.  I did not change the flags.

If you get the following error from `configure'

     checking for cc option to accept ANSI C... no
     configure: error: MySQL requires a ANSI C compiler (and a C++ compiler). Try gcc. See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.

Check that you don't have the path to the K&R compiler before the path
to the HP-UX C and C++ compiler.

IBM-AIX notes
.............

Automatic detection of `xlC' is missing from Autoconf, so a `configure'
command something like this is needed when compiling MySQL (This
example uses the IBM compiler):

     export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
     export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
     export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
     export LDLFAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
     export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
     
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
     		--localstatedir=/var/mysql \
     		--sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
     		--sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
     		--libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
     		--enable-thread-safe-client \
     		--enable-large-files

Above are the options used to compile the MySQL distribution that can
be found at `http://www-frec.bull.com/'.

If you change the `-O3' to `-O2' in the above configure line, you must
also remove the `-qstrict' option (this is a limitation in the IBM C
compiler).

If you are using `gcc' or `egcs' to compile MySQL, you *MUST* use the
`-fno-exceptions' flag, as the exception handling in `gcc'/`egcs' is
not thread safe!  (This is tested with `egcs' 1.1.).  There are also
some known problems with IBM's assembler, which may cause it to
generate bad code when used with gcc.

We recommend the following `configure' line with `egcs' and `gcc 2.95'
on AIX:

     CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
     CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
     CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory

The `-Wa,-many' is necessary for the compile to be successful.  IBM is
aware of this problem but is in to hurry to fix it because of the
workaround available.  We don't know if the `-fno-exceptions' is
required with `gcc 2.95', but as MySQL doesn't use exceptions and the
above option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always
use this option with `egcs / gcc'.

If you get a problem with assembler code try changing the -mcpu=xxx to
match your cpu. Typically power2, power, or powerpc may need to be used,
alternatively you might need to use 604 or 604e. I'm not positive but I
would think using "power" would likely be safe most of the time, even on
a power2 machine.

If you don't know what your cpu is then do a "uname -m", this will give
you back a string that looks like "000514676700", with a format of
xxyyyyyymmss where xx and ss are always 0's, yyyyyy is a unique system
id and mm is the id of the CPU Planar. A chart of these values can be
found at
`http://www.rs6000.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm'.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of cpu you have.

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly under high
load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and signals.  In this
case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by configuring with:

     shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
            CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-low-memory

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side effect
that you can't kill clients that are "sleeping" on a connection with
`mysqladmin kill' or `mysqladmin shutdown'.  Instead, the client will
die when it issues its next command.

On some versions of AIX, linking with `libbind.a' makes `getservbyname'
core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported to IBM.

For AIX 4.2.1 and gcc you have to do the following changes.

After configuring, edit `config.h' and `include/my_config.h' and change
the line that says

     #define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1

to

     #undef HAVE_SNPRINTF

And finally, in `mysqld.cc' you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

     #ifdef _AIX41
     extern "C" int initgroups(const char *,int);
     #endif

SunOS 4 Notes
.............

On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL, which in turn
means you will need GNU `make'.

Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and `libtool'.
You can use the following `configure' line to avoid this problem:

     shell> ./configure --disable-shared --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

When compiling `readline', you may get warnings about duplicate defines.
These may be ignored.

When compiling `mysqld', there will be some `implicit declaration of
function' warnings. These may be ignored.

Alpha-DEC-UNIX Notes (Tru64)
............................

If you are using egcs 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to gcc
2.95.2, as egcs on DEC has some serious bugs!

When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the `-pthread' option for `cc' and `cxx' and the
libraries `-lmach -lexc' (in addition to `-lpthread').  You should run
`configure' something like this:

     CC="cc -pthread" CXX="cxx -pthread -O" \
     ./configure --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"

When compiling `mysqld', you may see a couple of warnings like this:

     mysqld.cc: In function void handle_connections()':
     mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
     accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'

You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because `configure'
can detect only errors, not warnings.

If you start the server directly from the command line, you may have
problems with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your
outstanding processes receive a `SIGHUP' signal.)  If so, try starting
the server like this:

     shell> nohup mysqld [options] &

`nohup' causes the command following it to ignore any `SIGHUP' signal
sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
`safe_mysqld', which invokes `mysqld' using `nohup' for you.  *Note
`safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

If you get a problem when compiling mysys/get_opt.c, just remove the
line #define _NO_PROTO from the start of that file!

If you are using Compac's CC compiler, the following configure line
should work:

     CC="cc -pthread"
     CFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all -arch host"
     CXX="cxx -pthread"
     CXXFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all -arch host"
     export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
     ./configure \
     --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
     --with-low-memory \
     --enable-large-files \
     --enable-shared=yes \
     --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"
     gnumake

If you get a problem with libtool, when compiling with shared libraries
as above, when linking `mysql', you should be able to get around this
by issuing:

     cd mysql
     /bin/sh ../libtool --mode=link cxx -pthread  -O3 -DDBUG_OFF \
     -O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed \
     -speculate all \ -arch host  -DUNDEF_HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R \
     -o mysql  mysql.o readline.o sql_string.o completion_hash.o \
     ../readline/libreadline.a -lcurses \
     ../libmysql/.libs/libmysqlclient.so  -lm
     cd ..
     gnumake
     gnumake install
     scripts/mysql_install_db

Alpha-DEC-OSF1 Notes
....................

If you have problems compiling and have DEC `CC' and `gcc' installed,
try running `configure' like this:

     CC=cc CFLAGS=-O CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

If you get problems with the `c_asm.h' file, you can create and use a
'dummy' `c_asm.h' file with:

     touch include/c_asm.h
     CC=gcc CFLAGS=-I./include \
     CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

Note that the following problems with the `ld' program can be fixed by
downloading the latest DEC (Compaq) patch kit from:
`http://ftp.support.compaq.com/public/unix/'.

On OSF1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev.
878)" the compiler had some strange behavior (undefined `asm' symbols).
`/bin/ld' also appears to be broken (problems with `_exit undefined'
errors occuring while linking `mysqld').  On this system, we have
managed to compile MySQL with the following `configure' line, after
replacing `/bin/ld' with the version from OSF 4.0C:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

With the Digital compiler "C++ V6.1-029", the following should work:

     CC=cc -pthread
     CFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all -arch host
     CXX=cxx -pthread
     CXXFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all -arch host -noexceptions -nortti
     export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/mysql/mysql --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static --disable-shared --with-named-thread-libs="-lmach -lexc -lc"

In some versions of OSF1, the `alloca()' function is broken. Fix this
by removing the line in `config.h' that defines `'HAVE_ALLOCA''.

The `alloca()' function also may have an incorrect prototype in
`/usr/include/alloca.h'.  This warning resulting from this can be
ignored.

`configure' will use the following thread libraries automatically:
`--with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"'.

When using `gcc', you can also try running `configure' like this:

     shell> CFLAGS=-D_PTHREAD_USE_D4 CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure ....

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly under high
load), you may have found an OS bug with threads and signals. In this
case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by configuring with:

     shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
            CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
            ./configure ...

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side effect
that you can't kill clients that are "sleeping" on a connection with
`mysqladmin kill' or `mysqladmin shutdown'.  Instead, the client will
die when it issues its next command.

With `gcc' 2.95.2, you will probably run into the following compile
error:

     sql_acl.cc:1456: Internal compiler error in `scan_region', at except.c:2566
     Please submit a full bug report.

To fix this you should change to the `sql' directory and do a "cut and
paste" of the last `gcc' line, but change `-O3' to `-O0' (or add `-O0'
immediately after `gcc' if you don't have any `-O' option on your
compile line.)  After this is done you can just change back to the
top-level directly and run `make' again.

SGI Irix Notes
..............

If you are using Irix Version 6.5.3 or newer `mysqld' will only be able
to create threads if you run it as a user with `CAP_SCHED_MGT'
privileges (like `root') or give the `mysqld' server this privilege
with the following shell command:

     shell> chcap "CAP_SCHED_MGT+epi" /opt/mysql/libexec/mysqld

You may have to undefine some things in `config.h' after running
`configure' and before compiling.

In some Irix implementations, the `alloca()' function is broken.  If the
`mysqld' server dies on some `SELECT' statements, remove the lines from
`config.h' that define `HAVE_ALLOC' and `HAVE_ALLOCA_H'.  If
`mysqladmin create' doesn't work, remove the line from `config.h' that
defines `HAVE_READDIR_R'.  You may have to remove the `HAVE_TERM_H'
line as well.

SGI recommends that you install all of the patches on this page as a
set:
http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_indigo.rps.html

At the very minimum, you should install the latest kernel rollup, the
latest `rld' rollup, and the latest `libc' rollup.

You definitely need all the POSIX patches on this page, for pthreads
support:

`http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_posix.rps.html'

If you get the something like the following error when compiling
`mysql.cc':

     "/usr/include/curses.h", line 82: error(1084): invalid combination of type

Type the following in the top-level directory of your MySQL source tree:

     shell> extra/replace bool curses_bool < /usr/include/curses.h > include/curses.h
     shell> make

There have also been reports of scheduling problems.  If only one
thread is running, things go slow.  Avoid this by starting another
client.  This may lead to a 2-to-10-fold increase in execution speed
thereafter for the other thread.  This is a poorly understood problem
with Irix threads; you may have to improvise to find solutions until
this can be fixed.

If you are compiling with `gcc', you can use the following `configure'
command:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-thread-safe-client --with-named-thread-libs=-lpthread

On Irix 6.5.11 with native Irix C and C++ compilers ver. 7.3.1.2, the
following is reported to work

     CC=cc CXX=CC CFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 -I/usr/local/include \
     -L/usr/local/lib' CXXFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 \
     -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib' ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \

SCO Notes
.........

The current port is tested only on a "sco3.2v5.0.4" and "sco3.2v5.0.5"
system.  There has also been a lot of progress on a port to "sco
3.2v4.2".

For the moment the recommended compiler on OpenServer is gcc 2.95.2.
With this you should be able to compile MySQL with just:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure ... (options)

  1. For OpenServer 5.0.X you need to use GDS in Skunkware 95 (95q4c).
     This is necessary because GNU `gcc' 2.7.2 in Skunkware 97 does not
     have GNU `as'.  You can also use `egcs' 1.1.2 or newer
     `http://www.egcs.com/'.  If you are using `egcs' 1.1.2 you have to
     execute the following command:

          shell> cp -p /usr/include/pthread/stdtypes.h /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-sco3.2v5.0.5/egcs-2.91.66/include/pthread/

  2. You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
     system.  They are required on this version of SCO Unix.  You cannot
     just use the GCC Dev system.

  3. You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.
     This can be found at
     `http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/FSU-threads.tar.gz'.
     You can also get a precompiled package from
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz'.

  4. FSU Pthreads can be compiled with SCO Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
     OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the SCO
     Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or
     OS 3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of
     problems without a good port.  The port for this product requires
     the SCO Unix Development system.  Without it, you are missing the
     libraries and the linker that is needed.

  5. To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:

       a. Run `./configure' in the `threads/src' directory and select
          the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies
          `Makefile.SCO5' to `Makefile'.

       b. Run `make'.

       c. To install in the default `/usr/include' directory, login as
          root, then `cd' to the `thread/src' directory, and run `make
          install'.

  6. Remember to use GNU `make' when making MySQL.

  7. If you don't start `safe_mysqld' as root, you probably will get
     only the default 110 open files per process.  `mysqld' will write
     a note about this in the log file.

  8. With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or
     newer.  You should also use gcc 2.95.2 or newer!

     The following `configure' command should work:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

  9. With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or
     newer.  The following `configure' command should work:

          shell> CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" \
                 ./configure \
                     --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                     --with-named-thread-libs="-lgthreads -lsocket -lgen -lgthreads" \
                     --with-named-curses-libs="-lcurses"

     You may get some problems with some include files. In this case,
     you can find new SCO-specific include files at
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/SCO-3.2v4.2-includes.tar.gz'.
     You should unpack this file in the `include' directory of your
     MySQL source tree.

SCO development notes:

   * MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link `mysqld'
     with `-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads'.

   * The SCO development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.  SCO
     claims that its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must
     be reentrant with FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries
     to use the SCO scheme to make re-entrant libraries.

   * FSU Pthreads (at least the version at `http://www.mysql.com/')
     comes linked with GNU `malloc'.  If you encounter problems with
     memory usage, make sure that `gmalloc.o' is included in
     `libgthreads.a' and `libgthreads.so'.

   * In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware:
     `read()', `write()', `getmsg()', `connect()', `accept()',
     `select()', and `wait()'.

   * The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
     erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (ver 2.0.0) breaks FSU threads
     and makes mysqld instable.  You have to remove this one if you
     want to run mysqld on an OpenServer 5.0.6 machine.

If you want to install DBI on SCO, you have to edit the `Makefile' in
DBI-xxx and each subdirectory.

Note that the following assumes gcc 2.95.2 or newer:

     OLD:                                  NEW:
     CC = cc                               CC = gcc
     CCCDLFLAGS = -KPIC -W1,-Bexport       CCCDLFLAGS = -fpic
     CCDLFLAGS = -wl,-Bexport              CCDLFLAGS =
     
     LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
     LDDLFLAGS = -G -L/usr/local/lib       LDDLFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
     LDFLAGS = -belf -L/usr/local/lib      LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
     
     LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
     OPTIMISE = -Od                        OPTIMISE = -O1
     
     OLD:
     CCCFLAGS = -belf -dy -w0 -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include
     
     NEW:
     CCFLAGS = -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include

This is because the Perl dynaloader will not load the `DBI' modules if
they were compiled with `icc' or `cc'.

Perl works best when compiled with `cc'.

SCO Unixware Version 7.0 Notes
..............................

You must use a version of MySQL at least as recent as Version 3.22.13
because that version fixes some portability problems under Unixware.

We have been able to compile MySQL with the following `configure'
command on Unixware Version 7.0.1:

     CC=cc CXX=CC ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

If you want to use `gcc', you must use `gcc' 2.95.2 or newer.

File: mysql.info,  Node: OS/2,  Next: BeOS,  Prev: Other Unix Notes,  Up: Operating System Specific Notes

OS/2 Notes
----------

MySQL uses quite a few open files. Because of this, you should add
something like the following to your `CONFIG.SYS' file:

     SET EMXOPT=-c -n -h1024

If you don't do this, you will probably run into the following error:

     File 'xxxx' not found (Errcode: 24)

When using MySQL with OS/2 Warp 3, FixPack 29 or above is required.
With OS/2 Warp 4, FixPack 4 or above is required. This is a requirement
of the Pthreads library.  MySQL must be installed in a partition that
supports long filenames such as HPFS, FAT32, etc.

The `INSTALL.CMD' script must be run from OS/2's own `CMD.EXE' and may
not work with replacement shells such as `4OS2.EXE'.

The `scripts/mysql-install-db' script has been renamed.  It is now
called `install.cmd' and is a REXX script, which will set up the default
MySQL security settings and create the WorkPlace Shell icons for MySQL.

Dynamic module support is compiled in but not fully tested. Dynamic
modules should be compiled using the Pthreads run-time library.

     gcc -Zdll -Zmt -Zcrtdll=pthrdrtl -I../include -I../regex -I.. \
         -o example udf_example.cc -L../lib -lmysqlclient udf_example.def
     mv example.dll example.udf

*Note:* Due to limitations in OS/2, UDF module name stems must not
exceed 8 characters. Modules are stored in the `/mysql2/udf' directory;
the `safe-mysqld.cmd' script will put this directory in the
`BEGINLIBPATH' environment variable. When using UDF modules, specified
extensions are ignored -- it is assumed to be `.udf'.  For example, in
Unix, the shared module might be named `example.so' and you would load
a function from it like this:

     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "example.so";

Is OS/2, the module would be named `example.udf', but you would not
specify the module extension:

     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "example";

This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing how
to use the `mysql' client program to create and use a simple database.
`mysql' (sometimes referred to as the "terminal monitor" or just
"monitor") is an interactive program that allows you to connect to a
MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.  `mysql' may also be
used in batch mode: you place your queries in a file beforehand, then
tell `mysql' to execute the contents of the file.  Both ways of using
`mysql' are covered here.

To see a list of options provided by `mysql', invoke it with the
`--help' option:

     shell> mysql --help

This chapter assumes that `mysql' is installed on your machine and that
a MySQL server is available to which you can connect.  If this is not
true, contact your MySQL administrator.  (If _you_ are the
administrator, you will need to consult other sections of this manual.)

This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database.  If you are interested only in accessing an already-existing
database, you may want to skip over the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are
necessarily left out.  Consult the relevant sections of the manual for
more information on the topics covered here.

Connecting to and Disconnecting from the Server
===============================================

To connect to the server, you'll usually need to provide a MySQL user
name when you invoke `mysql' and, most likely, a password.  If the
server runs on a machine other than the one where you log in, you'll
also need to specify a hostname.  Contact your administrator to find
out what connection parameters you should use to connect (that is, what
host, user name, and password to use).  Once you know the proper
parameters, you should be able to connect like this:

     shell> mysql -h host -u user -p
     Enter password: ********

The `********' represents your password; enter it when `mysql' displays
the `Enter password:' prompt.

If that works, you should see some introductory information followed by
a `mysql>' prompt:

     shell> mysql -h host -u user -p
     Enter password: ********
     Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
     Your MySQL connection id is 459 to server version: 3.22.20a-log
     
     Type 'help' for help.
     
     mysql>

The prompt tells you that `mysql' is ready for you to enter commands.

Some MySQL installations allow users to connect as the anonymous
(unnamed) user to the server running on the local host.  If this is the
case on your machine, you should be able to connect to that server by
invoking `mysql' without any options:

     shell> mysql

After you have connected successfully, you can disconnect any time by
typing `QUIT' at the `mysql>' prompt:

     mysql> QUIT
     Bye

You can also disconnect by pressing Control-D.

Most examples in the following sections assume you are connected to the
server.  They indicate this by the `mysql>' prompt.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Entering queries,  Next: Database use,  Prev: Connecting-disconnecting,  Up: Tutorial

Entering Queries
================

Make sure you are connected to the server, as discussed in the previous
section.  Doing so will not in itself select any database to work with,
but that's okay.  At this point, it's more important to find out a
little about how to issue queries than to jump right in creating
tables, loading data into them, and retrieving data from them.  This
section describes the basic principles of entering commands, using
several queries you can try out to familiarize yourself with how
`mysql' works.

Here's a simple command that asks the server to tell you its version
number and the current date.  Type it in as shown below following the
`mysql>' prompt and hit the RETURN key:

     mysql> SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
     +--------------+--------------+
     | version()    | CURRENT_DATE |
     +--------------+--------------+
     | 3.22.20a-log | 1999-03-19   |
     +--------------+--------------+
     1 row in set (0.01 sec)
     mysql>

This query illustrates several things about `mysql':

   * A command normally consists of a SQL statement followed by a
     semicolon.  (There are some exceptions where a semicolon is not
     needed.  `QUIT', mentioned earlier, is one of them.  We'll get to
     others later.)

   * When you issue a command, `mysql' sends it to the server for
     execution and displays the results, then prints another `mysql>'
     to indicate that it is ready for another command.

   * `mysql' displays query output as a table (rows and columns).  The
     first row contains labels for the columns.  The rows following are
     the query results.  Normally, column labels are the names of the
     columns you fetch from database tables.  If you're retrieving the
     value of an expression rather than a table column (as in the
     example just shown), `mysql' labels the column using the
     expression itself.

   * `mysql' shows how many rows were returned and how long the query
     took to execute, which gives you a rough idea of server
     performance.  These values are imprecise because they represent
     wall clock time (not CPU or machine time), and because they are
     affected by factors such as server load and network latency.  (For
     brevity, the "rows in set" line is not shown in the remaining
     examples in this chapter.)

Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.  The following queries are
equivalent:

     mysql> SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
     mysql> select version(), current_date;
     mysql> SeLeCt vErSiOn(), current_DATE;

Here's another query.  It demonstrates that you can use `mysql' as a
simple calculator:

     mysql> SELECT SIN(PI()/4), (4+1)*5;
     +-------------+---------+
     | SIN(PI()/4) | (4+1)*5 |
     +-------------+---------+
     |    0.707107 |      25 |
     +-------------+---------+

The commands shown thus far have been relatively short, single-line
statements.  You can even enter multiple statements on a single line.
Just end each one with a semicolon:

     mysql> SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();
     +--------------+
     | version()    |
     +--------------+
     | 3.22.20a-log |
     +--------------+
     
     +---------------------+
     | NOW()               |
     +---------------------+
     | 1999-03-19 00:15:33 |
     +---------------------+

A command need not be given all on a single line, so lengthy commands
that require several lines are not a problem.  `mysql' determines where
your statement ends by looking for the terminating semicolon, not by
looking for the end of the input line.  (In other words, `mysql'
accepts free-format input:  it collects input lines but does not
execute them until it sees the semicolon.)

Here's a simple multiple-line statement:

     mysql> SELECT
         -> USER()
         -> ,
         -> CURRENT_DATE;
     +--------------------+--------------+
     | USER()             | CURRENT_DATE |
     +--------------------+--------------+
     | joesmith@localhost | 1999-03-18   |
     +--------------------+--------------+

In this example, notice how the prompt changes from `mysql>' to `->'
after you enter the first line of a multiple-line query.  This is how
`mysql' indicates that it hasn't seen a complete statement and is
waiting for the rest.  The prompt is your friend, because it provides
valuable feedback.  If you use that feedback, you will always be aware
of what `mysql' is waiting for.

If you decide you don't want to execute a command that you are in the
process of entering, cancel it by typing `\c':

     mysql> SELECT
         -> USER()
         -> \c
     mysql>

Here, too, notice the prompt.  It switches back to `mysql>' after you
type `\c', providing feedback to indicate that `mysql' is ready for a
new command.

The following table shows each of the prompts you may see and
summarizes what they mean about the state that `mysql' is in:

*Prompt**Meaning*
`mysql>'Ready for new command.
`       Waiting for next line of multiple-line command.
->'     
`       Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a
'>'     single quote (`'').
`       Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a
">'     double quote (`"').

Multiple-line statements commonly occur by accident when you intend to
issue a command on a single line, but forget the terminating semicolon.
In this case, `mysql' waits for more input:

     mysql> SELECT USER()
         ->

If this happens to you (you think you've entered a statement but the
only response is a `->' prompt), most likely `mysql' is waiting for the
semicolon.  If you don't notice what the prompt is telling you, you
might sit there for a while before realizing what you need to do.
Enter a semicolon to complete the statement, and `mysql' will execute
it:

     mysql> SELECT USER()
         -> ;
     +--------------------+
     | USER()             |
     +--------------------+
     | joesmith@localhost |
     +--------------------+

The `'>' and `">' prompts occur during string collection.  In MySQL,
you can write strings surrounded by either `'' or `"' characters (for
example, `'hello'' or `"goodbye"'), and `mysql' lets you enter strings
that span multiple lines.  When you see a `'>' or `">' prompt, it means
that you've entered a line containing a string that begins with a `''
or `"' quote character, but have not yet entered the matching quote
that terminates the string.  That's fine if you really are entering a
multiple-line string, but how likely is that?  Not very.  More often,
the `'>' and `">' prompts indicate that you've inadvertantly left out a
quote character.  For example:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age < 30;
         ">

If you enter this `SELECT' statement, then hit RETURN and wait for the
result, nothing will happen.  Instead of wondering why this query takes
so long, notice the clue provided by the `">' prompt.  It tells you
that `mysql' expects to see the rest of an unterminated string.  (Do
you see the error in the statement?  The string `"Smith' is missing the
second quote.)

At this point, what do you do?  The simplest thing is to cancel the
command.  However, you cannot just type `\c' in this case, because
`mysql' interprets it as part of the string that it is collecting!
Instead, enter the closing quote character (so `mysql' knows you've
finished the string), then type `\c':

     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age < 30;
         "> "\c
     mysql>

The prompt changes back to `mysql>', indicating that `mysql' is ready
for a new command.

It's important to know what the `'>' and `">' prompts signify, because
if you mistakenly enter an unterminated string, any further lines you
type will appear to be ignored by `mysql' -- including a line
containing `QUIT'!  This can be quite confusing, especially if you
don't know that you need to supply the terminating quote before you can
cancel the current command.

Creating and Using a Database
=============================

* Menu:

* Creating database::           Creating a database
* Creating tables::             Creating a table
* Loading tables::              Loading data into a table
* Retrieving data::             Retrieving information from a table

Now that you know how to enter commands, it's time to access a database.

Suppose you have several pets in your home (your menagerie) and you'd
like to keep track of various types of information about them.  You can
do so by creating tables to hold your data and loading them with the
desired information.  Then you can answer different sorts of questions
about your animals by retrieving data from the tables.  This section
shows you how to:

   * Create a database

   * Create a table

   * Load data into the table

   * Retrieve data from the table in various ways

   * Use multiple tables

The menagerie database will be simple (deliberately), but it is not
difficult to think of real-world situations in which a similar type of
database might be used.  For example, a database like this could be
used by a farmer to keep track of livestock, or by a veterinarian to
keep track of patient records.  A menagerie distribution containing
some of the queries and sample data used in the following sections can
be obtained from the MySQL Web site.  It's available in either
compressed `tar' format
(http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz) or
Zip format
(http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip).

Use the `SHOW' statement to find out what databases currently exist on
the server:

     mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
     +----------+
     | Database |
     +----------+
     | mysql    |
     | test     |
     | tmp      |
     +----------+

The list of databases is probably different on your machine, but the
`mysql' and `test' databases are likely to be among them.  The `mysql'
database is required because it describes user access privileges.  The
`test' database is often provided as a workspace for users to try
things out.

If the `test' database exists, try to access it:

     mysql> USE test
     Database changed

Note that `USE', like `QUIT', does not require a semicolon.  (You can
terminate such statements with a semicolon if you like; it does no
harm.)  The `USE' statement is special in another way, too:  it must be
given on a single line.

You can use the `test' database (if you have access to it) for the
examples that follow, but anything you create in that database can be
removed by anyone else with access to it.  For this reason, you should
probably ask your MySQL administrator for permission to use a database
of your own.  Suppose you want to call yours `menagerie'.  The
administrator needs to execute a command like this:

     mysql> GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO your_mysql_name;

where `your_mysql_name' is the MySQL user name assigned to you.

Creating and Selecting a Database
---------------------------------

If the administrator creates your database for you when setting up your
permissions, you can begin using it.  Otherwise, you need to create it
yourself:

     mysql> CREATE DATABASE menagerie;

Under Unix, database names are case sensitive (unlike SQL keywords), so
you must always refer to your database as `menagerie', not as
`Menagerie', `MENAGERIE', or some other variant.  This is also true for
table names.  (Under Windows, this restriction does not apply, although
you must refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase
throughout a given query.)

Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that
explicitly.  To make `menagerie' the current database, use this command:

     mysql> USE menagerie
     Database changed

Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for
use each time you begin a `mysql' session.  You can do this by issuing a
`USE' statement as shown above.  Alternatively, you can select the
database on the command line when you invoke `mysql'.  Just specify its
name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide.
For example:

     shell> mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
     Enter password: ********

Note that `menagerie' is not your password on the command just shown.
If you want to supply your password on the command line after the `-p'
option, you must do so with no intervening space (for example, as
`-pmypassword', not as `-p mypassword').  However, putting your
password on the command line is not recommended, because doing so
exposes it to snooping by other users logged in on your machine.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Creating tables,  Next: Loading tables,  Prev: Creating database,  Up: Database use

Creating a Table
----------------

Creating the database is the easy part, but at this point it's empty, as
`SHOW TABLES' will tell you:

     mysql> SHOW TABLES;
     Empty set (0.00 sec)

The harder part is deciding what the structure of your database should
be: what tables you will need and what columns will be in each of them.

You'll want a table that contains a record for each of your pets.  This
can be called the `pet' table, and it should contain, as a bare minimum,
each animal's name.  Because the name by itself is not very
interesting, the table should contain other information.  For example,
if more than one person in your family keeps pets, you might want to
list each animal's owner.  You might also want to record some basic
descriptive information such as species and sex.

How about age?  That might be of interest, but it's not a good thing to
store in a database.  Age changes as time passes, which means you'd
have to update your records often.  Instead, it's better to store a
fixed value such as date of birth.  Then, whenever you need age, you
can calculate it as the difference between the current date and the
birth date.  MySQL provides functions for doing date arithmetic, so
this is not difficult.  Storing birth date rather than age has other
advantages, too:

   * You can use the database for tasks such as generating reminders
     for upcoming pet birthdays.  (If you think this type of query is
     somewhat silly, note that it is the same question you might ask in
     the context of a business database to identify clients to whom
     you'll soon need to send out birthday greetings, for that
     computer-assisted personal touch.)

   * You can calculate age in relation to dates other than the current
     date.  For example, if you store death date in the database, you
     can easily calculate how old a pet was when it died.

You can probably think of other types of information that would be
useful in the `pet' table, but the ones identified so far are
sufficient for now: name, owner, species, sex, birth, and death.

Use a `CREATE TABLE' statement to specify the layout of your table:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
         -> species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);

`VARCHAR' is a good choice for the `name', `owner', and `species'
columns because the column values will vary in length.  The lengths of
those columns need not all be the same, and need not be `20'.  You can
pick any length from `1' to `255', whatever seems most reasonable to
you.  (If you make a poor choice and it turns out later that you need a
longer field, MySQL provides an `ALTER TABLE' statement.)

Animal sex can be represented in a variety of ways, for example, `"m"'
and `"f"', or perhaps `"male"' and `"female"'.  It's simplest to use
the single characters `"m"' and `"f"'.

The use of the `DATE' data type for the `birth' and `death' columns is
a fairly obvious choice.

Now that you have created a table, `SHOW TABLES' should produce some
output:

     mysql> SHOW TABLES;
     +---------------------+
     | Tables in menagerie |
     +---------------------+
     | pet                 |
     +---------------------+

To verify that your table was created the way you expected, use a
`DESCRIBE' statement:

     mysql> DESCRIBE pet;
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
     | Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
     | name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

You can use `DESCRIBE' any time, for example, if you forget the names of
the columns in your table or what types they are.

Loading Data into a Table
-------------------------

After creating your table, you need to populate it.  The `LOAD DATA' and
`INSERT' statements are useful for this.

Suppose your pet records can be described as shown below.  (Observe
that MySQL expects dates in `YYYY-MM-DD' format; this may be different
than what you are used to.)

*name*       *owner*      *species*    *sex*        *birth*      *death*
Fluffy       Harold       cat          f            1993-02-04   
Claws        Gwen         cat          m            1994-03-17   
Buffy        Harold       dog          f            1989-05-13   
Fang         Benny        dog          m            1990-08-27   
Bowser       Diane        dog          m            1998-08-31   1995-07-29
Chirpy       Gwen         bird         f            1998-09-11   
Whistler     Gwen         bird                      1997-12-09   
Slim         Benny        snake        m            1996-04-29   

Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate
it is to create a text file containing a row for each of your animals,
then load the contents of the file into the table with a single
statement.

You could create a text file `pet.txt' containing one record per line,
with values separated by tabs, and given in the order in which the
columns were listed in the `CREATE TABLE' statement.  For missing
values (such as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still
living), you can use `NULL' values.  To represent these in your text
file, use `\N'.  For example, the record for Whistler the bird would
look like this (where the whitespace between values is a single tab
character):

`Whistler'  `Gwen'      `bird'      `\N'        `1997-12-09'       `\N'

To load the text file `pet.txt' into the `pet' table, use this command:

     mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;

You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker
explicitly in the `LOAD DATA' statement if you wish, but the defaults
are tab and linefeed.  These are sufficient for the statement to read
the file `pet.txt' properly.

When you want to add new records one at a time, the `INSERT' statement
is useful.  In its simplest form, you supply values for each column, in
the order in which the columns were listed in the `CREATE TABLE'
statement.  Suppose Diane gets a new hamster named Puffball.  You could
add a new record using an `INSERT' statement like this:

     mysql> INSERT INTO pet
         -> VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);

Note that string and date values are specified as quoted strings here.
Also, with `INSERT', you can insert `NULL' directly to represent a
missing value.  You do not use `\N' like you do with `LOAD DATA'.

From this example, you should be able to see that there would be a lot
more typing involved to load your records initially using several
`INSERT' statements rather than a single `LOAD DATA' statement.

The `SELECT' statement is used to pull information from a table.  The
general form of the statement is:

     SELECT what_to_select
     FROM which_table
     WHERE conditions_to_satisfy

`what_to_select' indicates what you want to see.  This can be a list of
columns, or `*' to indicate "all columns." `which_table' indicates the
table from which you want to retrieve data.  The `WHERE' clause is
optional.  If it's present, `conditions_to_satisfy' specifies
conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for retrieval.

Selecting All Data
..................

The simplest form of `SELECT' retrieves everything from a table:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet;
     +----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
     | Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
     | Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
     | Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
     | Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1998-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     | Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
     | Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
     | Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
     | Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
     +----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+

This form of `SELECT' is useful if you want to review your entire table,
for instance, after you've just loaded it with your initial dataset.
As it happens, the output just shown reveals an error in your data
file:  Bowser appears to have been born after he died!  Consulting your
original pedigree papers, you find that the correct birth year is 1989,
not 1998.

There are are least a couple of ways to fix this:

   * Edit the file `pet.txt' to correct the error, then empty the table
     and reload it using `DELETE' and `LOAD DATA':

          mysql> SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;  # Used for quick re-create of the table
          mysql> DELETE FROM pet;
          mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;

     However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record for
     Puffball.

   * Fix only the erroneous record with an `UPDATE' statement:

          mysql> UPDATE pet SET birth = "1989-08-31" WHERE name = "Bowser";

As shown above, it is easy to retrieve an entire table.  But typically
you don't want to do that, particularly when the table becomes large.
Instead, you're usually more interested in answering a particular
question, in which case you specify some constraints on the information
you want.  Let's look at some selection queries in terms of questions
about your pets that they answer.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Selecting rows,  Next: Selecting columns,  Prev: Selecting all,  Up: Retrieving data

Selecting Particular Rows
.........................

You can select only particular rows from your table.  For example, if
you want to verify the change that you made to Bowser's birth date,
select Bowser's record like this:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = "Bowser";
     +--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name   | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Bowser | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     +--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+

The output confirms that the year is correctly recorded now as 1989,
not 1998.

String comparisons are normally case insensitive, so you can specify the
name as `"bowser"', `"BOWSER"', etc.  The query result will be the same.

You can specify conditions on any column, not just `name'.  For example,
if you want to know which animals were born after 1998, test the `birth'
column:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth >= "1998-1-1";
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
     | Puffball | Diane | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL  |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+

You can combine conditions, for example, to locate female dogs:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "dog" AND sex = "f";
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

The preceding query uses the `AND' logical operator.  There is also an
`OR' operator:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "snake" OR species = "bird";
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
     | Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL  |
     | Slim     | Benny | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL  |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+

`AND' and `OR' may be intermixed.  If you do that, it's a good idea to
use parentheses to indicate how conditions should be grouped:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = "cat" AND sex = "m")
         -> OR (species = "dog" AND sex = "f");
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
     | Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

Selecting Particular Columns
............................

If you don't want to see entire rows from your table, just name the
columns in which you're interested, separated by commas.  For example,
if you want to know when your animals were born, select the `name' and
`birth' columns:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet;
     +----------+------------+
     | name     | birth      |
     +----------+------------+
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
     +----------+------------+

To find out who owns pets, use this query:

     mysql> SELECT owner FROM pet;
     +--------+
     | owner  |
     +--------+
     | Harold |
     | Gwen   |
     | Harold |
     | Benny  |
     | Diane  |
     | Gwen   |
     | Gwen   |
     | Benny  |
     | Diane  |
     +--------+

However, notice that the query simply retrieves the `owner' field from
each record, and some of them appear more than once.  To minimize the
output, retrieve each unique output record just once by adding the
keyword `DISTINCT':

     mysql> SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
     +--------+
     | owner  |
     +--------+
     | Benny  |
     | Diane  |
     | Gwen   |
     | Harold |
     +--------+

You can use a `WHERE' clause to combine row selection with column
selection.  For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only, use
this query:

     mysql> SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
         -> WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat";
     +--------+---------+------------+
     | name   | species | birth      |
     +--------+---------+------------+
     | Fluffy | cat     | 1993-02-04 |
     | Claws  | cat     | 1994-03-17 |
     | Buffy  | dog     | 1989-05-13 |
     | Fang   | dog     | 1990-08-27 |
     | Bowser | dog     | 1989-08-31 |
     +--------+---------+------------+

Sorting Rows
............

You may have noticed in the preceding examples that the result rows are
displayed in no particular order.  However, it's often easier to examine
query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way.  To sort a
result, use an `ORDER BY' clause.

Here are animal birthdays, sorted by date:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;
     +----------+------------+
     | name     | birth      |
     +----------+------------+
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
     +----------+------------+

To sort in reverse order, add the `DESC' (descending) keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
     +----------+------------+
     | name     | birth      |
     +----------+------------+
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |

You can sort on multiple columns.  For example, to sort by type of
animal, then by birth date within animal type with youngest animals
first, use the following query:

     mysql> SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet ORDER BY species, birth DESC;
     +----------+---------+------------+
     | name     | species | birth      |
     +----------+---------+------------+
     | Chirpy   | bird    | 1998-09-11 |
     | Whistler | bird    | 1997-12-09 |
     | Claws    | cat     | 1994-03-17 |
     | Fluffy   | cat     | 1993-02-04 |
     | Fang     | dog     | 1990-08-27 |
     | Bowser   | dog     | 1989-08-31 |
     | Buffy    | dog     | 1989-05-13 |
     | Puffball | hamster | 1999-03-30 |
     | Slim     | snake   | 1996-04-29 |
     +----------+---------+------------+

Note that the `DESC' keyword applies only to the column name immediately
preceding it (`birth'); `species' values are still sorted in ascending
order.

Date Calculations
.................

MySQL provides several functions that you can use to perform
calculations on dates, for example, to calculate ages or extract parts
of dates.

To determine how many years old each of your pets is, compute the
difference in the year part of the current date and the birth date, then
subtract one if the current date occurs earlier in the calendar year
than the birth date.  The following query shows, for each pet, the
birth date, the current date, and the age in years.

     mysql> SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
         -> (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))
         -> - (RIGHT(CURRENT_DATE,5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
         -> AS age
         -> FROM pet;
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | name     | birth      | CURRENT_DATE | age  |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 | 2001-08-29   |    8 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 | 2001-08-29   |    7 |
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 | 2001-08-29   |   12 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 | 2001-08-29   |    3 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 | 2001-08-29   |    5 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+

Here, `YEAR()' pulls out the year part of a date and `RIGHT()' pulls
off the rightmost five characters that represent the `MM-DD' (calendar
year) part of the date.  The part of the expression that compares the
`MM-DD' values evaluates to 1 or 0, which adjusts the year difference
down a year if `CURRENT_DATE' occurs earlier in the year than `birth'.
The full expression is somewhat ungainly, so an alias (`age') is used
to make the output column label more meaningful.

The query works, but the result could be scanned more easily if the rows
were presented in some order.  This can be done by adding an `ORDER BY
name' clause to sort the output by name:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
         -> (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))
         -> - (RIGHT(CURRENT_DATE,5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
         -> AS age
         -> FROM pet ORDER BY name;
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | name     | birth      | CURRENT_DATE | age  |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 | 2001-08-29   |   12 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 | 2001-08-29   |    7 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 | 2001-08-29   |    8 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 | 2001-08-29   |    5 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 | 2001-08-29   |    3 |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+

To sort the output by `age' rather than `name', just use a different
`ORDER BY' clause:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
         -> (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))
         -> - (RIGHT(CURRENT_DATE,5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
         -> AS age
         -> FROM pet ORDER BY age;
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | name     | birth      | CURRENT_DATE | age  |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 | 2001-08-29   |    2 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 | 2001-08-29   |    3 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 | 2001-08-29   |    5 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 | 2001-08-29   |    7 |
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 | 2001-08-29   |    8 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 | 2001-08-29   |   11 |
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 | 2001-08-29   |   12 |
     +----------+------------+--------------+------+

A similar query can be used to determine age at death for animals that
have died.  You determine which animals these are by checking whether
or not the `death' value is `NULL'.  Then, for those with non-`NULL'
values, compute the difference between the `death' and `birth' values:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth, death,
         -> (YEAR(death)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(death,5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
         -> AS age
         -> FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
     +--------+------------+------------+------+
     | name   | birth      | death      | age  |
     +--------+------------+------------+------+
     | Bowser | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |    5 |
     +--------+------------+------------+------+

The query uses `death IS NOT NULL' rather than `death != NULL' because
`NULL' is a special value.  This is explained later.  *Note Working
with `NULL': Working with NULL.

What if you want to know which animals have birthdays next month?  For
this type of calculation, year and day are irrelevant; you simply want
to extract the month part of the `birth' column.  MySQL provides several
date-part extraction functions, such as `YEAR()', `MONTH()', and
`DAYOFMONTH()'.  `MONTH()' is the appropriate function here.  To see
how it works, run a simple query that displays the value of both
`birth' and `MONTH(birth)':

     mysql> SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
     +----------+------------+--------------+
     | name     | birth      | MONTH(birth) |
     +----------+------------+--------------+
     | Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |            2 |
     | Claws    | 1994-03-17 |            3 |
     | Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |            5 |
     | Fang     | 1990-08-27 |            8 |
     | Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |            8 |
     | Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |            9 |
     | Whistler | 1997-12-09 |           12 |
     | Slim     | 1996-04-29 |            4 |
     | Puffball | 1999-03-30 |            3 |
     +----------+------------+--------------+

Finding animals with birthdays in the upcoming month is easy, too.
Suppose the current month is April.  Then the month value is `4' and
you look for animals born in May (month 5) like this:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
     +-------+------------+
     | name  | birth      |
     +-------+------------+
     | Buffy | 1989-05-13 |
     +-------+------------+

There is a small complication if the current month is December, of
course.  You don't just add one to the month number (`12') and look for
animals born in month 13, because there is no such month.  Instead, you
look for animals born in January (month 1).

You can even write the query so that it works no matter what the current
month is.  That way you don't have to use a particular month number in
the query.  `DATE_ADD()' allows you to add a time interval to a given
date.  If you add a month to the value of `NOW()', then extract the
month part with `MONTH()', the result produces the month in which to
look for birthdays:

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet
         -> WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH));

A different way to accomplish the same task is to add `1' to get the
next month after the current one (after using the modulo function
(`MOD') to wrap around the month value to `0' if it is currently `12'):

     mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet
         -> WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(NOW()), 12) + 1;

Note that `MONTH' returns a number between 1 and 12. And
`MOD(something,12)' returns a number between 0 and 11. So the addition
has to be after the `MOD()', otherwise we would go from November (11)
to January (1).

Working with `NULL' Values
..........................

The `NULL' value can be surprising until you get used to it.
Conceptually, `NULL' means missing value or unknown value and it is
treated somewhat differently than other values.  To test for `NULL',
you cannot use the arithmetic comparison operators such as `=', `<', or
`!='.  To demonstrate this for yourself, try the following query:

     mysql> SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 != NULL, 1 < NULL, 1 > NULL;
     +----------+-----------+----------+----------+
     | 1 = NULL | 1 != NULL | 1 < NULL | 1 > NULL |
     +----------+-----------+----------+----------+
     |     NULL |      NULL |     NULL |     NULL |
     +----------+-----------+----------+----------+

Clearly you get no meaningful results from these comparisons.  Use the
`IS NULL' and `IS NOT NULL' operators instead:

     mysql> SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
     +-----------+---------------+
     | 1 IS NULL | 1 IS NOT NULL |
     +-----------+---------------+
     |         0 |             1 |
     +-----------+---------------+

In MySQL, 0 or `NULL' means false and anything else means true.  The
default truth value from a boolean operation is 1.

This special treatment of `NULL' is why, in the previous section, it
was necessary to determine which animals are no longer alive using
`death IS NOT NULL' instead of `death != NULL'.

Pattern Matching
................

MySQL provides standard SQL pattern matching as well as a form of
pattern matching based on extended regular expressions similar to those
used by Unix utilities such as `vi', `grep', and `sed'.

SQL pattern matching allows you to use `_' to match any single
character and `%' to match an arbitrary number of characters (including
zero characters).  In MySQL, SQL patterns are case insensitive by
default.  Some examples are shown below.  Note that you do not use `='
or `!=' when you use SQL patterns; use the `LIKE' or `NOT LIKE'
comparison operators instead.

To find names beginning with `b':

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE "b%";
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
     | Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+

To find names ending with `fy':

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE "%fy";
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
     | Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

To find names containing a `w':

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE "%w%";
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
     | Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     | Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+

To find names containing exactly five characters, use the `_' pattern
character:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE "_____";
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
     | Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

The other type of pattern matching provided by MySQL uses extended
regular expressions.  When you test for a match for this type of
pattern, use the `REGEXP' and `NOT REGEXP' operators (or `RLIKE' and
`NOT RLIKE', which are synonyms).

Some characteristics of extended regular expressions are:

   * `.' matches any single character.

   * A character class `[...]' matches any character within the
     brackets.  For example, `[abc]' matches `a', `b', or `c'.  To name
     a range of characters, use a dash.  `[a-z]' matches any lowercase
     letter, whereas `[0-9]' matches any digit.

   * `*' matches zero or more instances of the thing preceding it.  For
     example, `x*' matches any number of `x' characters, `[0-9]*'
     matches any number of digits, and `.*' matches any number of
     anything.

   * Regular expressions are case sensitive, but you can use a
     character class to match both lettercases if you wish.  For
     example, `[aA]' matches lowercase or uppercase `a' and `[a-zA-Z]'
     matches any letter in either case.

   * The pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the value being
     tested.  (SQL patterns match only if they match the entire value.)

   * To anchor a pattern so that it must match the beginning or end of
     the value being tested, use `^' at the beginning or `$' at the end
     of the pattern.

To demonstrate how extended regular expressions work, the `LIKE' queries
shown above are rewritten below to use `REGEXP'.

To find names beginning with `b', use `^' to match the beginning of the
name:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^b";
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
     | Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+

Prior to MySQL Version 3.23.4, `REGEXP' is case sensitive, and the
previous query will return no rows. To match either lowercase or
uppercase `b', use this query instead:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^[bB]";

From MySQL 3.23.4 on, to force a `REGEXP' comparison to be case
sensitive, use the `BINARY' keyword to make one of the strings a binary
string. This query will match only lowercase `b' at the beginning of a
name:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY "^b";

To find names ending with `fy', use `$' to match the end of the name:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "fy$";
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
     | Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

To find names containing a lowercase or uppercase `w', use this query:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "w";
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
     | Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
     | Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
     | Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
     +----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+

Because a regular expression pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in
the value, it is not necessary in the previous query to put a wild card
on either side of the pattern to get it to match the entire value like
it would be if you used a SQL pattern.

To find names containing exactly five characters, use `^' and `$' to
match the beginning and end of the name, and five instances of `.' in
between:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.....$";
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
     | Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

You could also write the previous query using the `{n}'
"repeat-`n'-times" operator:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^.{5}$";
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
     | Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
     | Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
     +-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+

Counting Rows
.............

Databases are often used to answer the question, "How often does a
certain type of data occur in a table?"  For example, you might want to
know how many pets you have, or how many pets each owner has, or you
might want to perform various kinds of censuses on your animals.

Counting the total number of animals you have is the same question as
"How many rows are in the `pet' table?" because there is one record per
pet.  The `COUNT()' function counts the number of non-`NULL' results, so
the query to count your animals looks like this:

     mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
     +----------+
     | COUNT(*) |
     +----------+
     |        9 |
     +----------+

Earlier, you retrieved the names of the people who owned pets.  You can
use `COUNT()' if you want to find out how many pets each owner has:

     mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
     +--------+----------+
     | owner  | COUNT(*) |
     +--------+----------+
     | Benny  |        2 |
     | Diane  |        2 |
     | Gwen   |        3 |
     | Harold |        2 |
     +--------+----------+

Note the use of `GROUP BY' to group together all records for each
`owner'.  Without it, all you get is an error message:

     mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(owner) FROM pet;
     ERROR 1140 at line 1: Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
     with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause

`COUNT()' and `GROUP BY' are useful for characterizing your data in
various ways.  The following examples show different ways to perform
animal census operations.

Number of animals per species:

     mysql> SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
     +---------+----------+
     | species | COUNT(*) |
     +---------+----------+
     | bird    |        2 |
     | cat     |        2 |
     | dog     |        3 |
     | hamster |        1 |
     | snake   |        1 |
     +---------+----------+

Number of animals per sex:

     mysql> SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY sex;
     +------+----------+
     | sex  | COUNT(*) |
     +------+----------+
     | NULL |        1 |
     | f    |        4 |
     | m    |        4 |
     +------+----------+

(In this output, `NULL' indicates sex unknown.)

Number of animals per combination of species and sex:

     mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species, sex;
     +---------+------+----------+
     | species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
     +---------+------+----------+
     | bird    | NULL |        1 |
     | bird    | f    |        1 |
     | cat     | f    |        1 |
     | cat     | m    |        1 |
     | dog     | f    |        1 |
     | dog     | m    |        2 |
     | hamster | f    |        1 |
     | snake   | m    |        1 |
     +---------+------+----------+

You need not retrieve an entire table when you use `COUNT()'.  For
example, the previous query, when performed just on dogs and cats,
looks like this:

     mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
         -> WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat"
         -> GROUP BY species, sex;
     +---------+------+----------+
     | species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
     +---------+------+----------+
     | cat     | f    |        1 |
     | cat     | m    |        1 |
     | dog     | f    |        1 |
     | dog     | m    |        2 |
     +---------+------+----------+

Or, if you wanted the number of animals per sex only for known-sex
animals:

     mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
         -> WHERE sex IS NOT NULL
         -> GROUP BY species, sex;
     +---------+------+----------+
     | species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
     +---------+------+----------+
     | bird    | f    |        1 |
     | cat     | f    |        1 |
     | cat     | m    |        1 |
     | dog     | f    |        1 |
     | dog     | m    |        2 |
     | hamster | f    |        1 |
     | snake   | m    |        1 |
     +---------+------+----------+

Using More Than one Table
.........................

The `pet' table keeps track of which pets you have.  If you want to
record other information about them, such as events in their lives like
visits to the vet or when litters are born, you need another table.
What should this table look like? It needs:

   * To contain the pet name so you know which animal each event
     pertains to.

   * A date so you know when the event occurred.

   * A field to describe the event.

   * An event type field, if you want to be able to categorize events.

Given these considerations, the `CREATE TABLE' statement for the
`event' table might look like this:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE event (name VARCHAR(20), date DATE,
         -> type VARCHAR(15), remark VARCHAR(255));

As with the `pet' table, it's easiest to load the initial records by
creating a tab-delimited text file containing the information:

Fluffy      1995-05-15  litter      4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male
Buffy       1993-06-23  litter      5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male
Buffy       1994-06-19  litter      3 puppies, 3 female
Chirpy      1999-03-21  vet         needed beak straightened
Slim        1997-08-03  vet         broken rib
Bowser      1991-10-12  kennel      
Fang        1991-10-12  kennel      
Fang        1998-08-28  birthday    Gave him a new chew toy
Claws       1998-03-17  birthday    Gave him a new flea collar
Whistler    1998-12-09  birthday    First birthday

Load the records like this:

     mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "event.txt" INTO TABLE event;

Based on what you've learned from the queries you've run on the `pet'
table, you should be able to perform retrievals on the records in the
`event' table; the principles are the same.  But when is the `event'
table by itself insufficient to answer questions you might ask?

Suppose you want to find out the ages of each pet when they had their
litters.  The `event' table indicates when this occurred, but to
calculate the age of the mother, you need her birth date.  Because that
is stored in the `pet' table, you need both tables for the query:

     mysql> SELECT pet.name, (TO_DAYS(date) - TO_DAYS(birth))/365 AS age, remark
         -> FROM pet, event
         -> WHERE pet.name = event.name AND type = "litter";
     +--------+------+-----------------------------+
     | name   | age  | remark                      |
     +--------+------+-----------------------------+
     | Fluffy | 2.27 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
     | Buffy  | 4.12 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
     | Buffy  | 5.10 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |
     +--------+------+-----------------------------+

There are several things to note about this query:

   * The `FROM' clause lists two tables because the query needs to pull
     information from both of them.

   * When combining (joining) information from multiple tables, you
     need to specify how records in one table can be matched to records
     in the other.  This is easy because they both have a `name'
     column.  The query uses `WHERE' clause to match up records in the
     two tables based on the `name' values.

   * Because the `name' column occurs in both tables, you must be
     specific about which table you mean when referring to the column.
     This is done by prepending the table name to the column name.

You need not have two different tables to perform a join.  Sometimes it
is useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in
a table to other records in that same table.  For example, to find
breeding pairs among your pets, you can join the `pet' table with
itself to pair up males and females of like species:

     mysql> SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
         -> FROM pet AS p1, pet AS p2
         -> WHERE p1.species = p2.species AND p1.sex = "f" AND p2.sex = "m";
     +--------+------+--------+------+---------+
     | name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
     +--------+------+--------+------+---------+
     | Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
     | Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
     | Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
     +--------+------+--------+------+---------+

In this query, we specify aliases for the table name in order to refer
to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table each
column reference is associated with.

Getting Information About Databases and Tables
==============================================

What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the
structure of a given table is (for example, what its columns are
called)?  MySQL addresses this problem through several statements that
provide information about the databases and tables it supports.

You have already seen `SHOW DATABASES', which lists the databases
managed by the server.  To find out which database is currently
selected, use the `DATABASE()' function:

     mysql> SELECT DATABASE();
     +------------+
     | DATABASE() |
     +------------+
     | menagerie  |
     +------------+

If you haven't selected any database yet, the result is blank.

To find out what tables the current database contains (for example, when
you're not sure about the name of a table), use this command:

     mysql> SHOW TABLES;
     +---------------------+
     | Tables in menagerie |
     +---------------------+
     | event               |
     | pet                 |
     +---------------------+

If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the `DESCRIBE'
command is useful; it displays information about each of a table's
columns:

     mysql> DESCRIBE pet;
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
     | Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
     | name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     | death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
     +---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

`Field' indicates the column name, `Type' is the data type for the
column, `Null' indicates whether or not the column can contain `NULL'
values, `Key' indicates whether or not the column is indexed, and
`Default' specifies the column's default value.

If you have indexes on a table, `SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name' produces
information about them.

Examples of Common Queries
==========================

Here are examples of how to solve some common problems with MySQL.

Some of the examples use the table `shop' to hold the price of each
article (item number) for certain traders (dealers).  Supposing that
each trader has a single fixed price per article, then (`article',
`dealer') is a primary key for the records.

Start the command line tool `mysql' and select a database:

     mysql your-database-name

(In most MySQL installations, you can use the database-name 'test').

You can create the example table as:

     CREATE TABLE shop (
      article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
      dealer  CHAR(20)                 DEFAULT ''     NOT NULL,
      price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY(article, dealer));
     
     INSERT INTO shop VALUES
     (1,'A',3.45),(1,'B',3.99),(2,'A',10.99),(3,'B',1.45),(3,'C',1.69),
     (3,'D',1.25),(4,'D',19.95);

Okay, so the example data is:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM shop;
     
     +---------+--------+-------+
     | article | dealer | price |
     +---------+--------+-------+
     |    0001 | A      |  3.45 |
     |    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
     |    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
     |    0003 | B      |  1.45 |
     |    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
     |    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
     |    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
     +---------+--------+-------+

The Maximum Value for a Column
------------------------------

"What's the highest item number?"

     SELECT MAX(article) AS article FROM shop
     
     +---------+
     | article |
     +---------+
     |       4 |
     +---------+

The Row Holding the Maximum of a Certain Column
-----------------------------------------------

"Find number, dealer, and price of the most expensive article."

In ANSI SQL this is easily done with a sub-query:

     SELECT article, dealer, price
     FROM   shop
     WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop)

In MySQL (which does not yet have sub-selects), just do it in two steps:

  1. Get the maximum price value from the table with a `SELECT'
     statement.

  2. Using this value compile the actual query:
          SELECT article, dealer, price
          FROM   shop
          WHERE  price=19.95

Another solution is to sort all rows descending by price and only get
the first row using the MySQL specific `LIMIT' clause:

     SELECT article, dealer, price
     FROM   shop
     ORDER BY price DESC
     LIMIT 1

*NOTE*:  If there are several most expensive articles (for example,
each 19.95) the `LIMIT' solution shows only one of them!

     +---------+-------+
     | article | price |
     +---------+-------+
     |    0001 |  3.99 |
     |    0002 | 10.99 |
     |    0003 |  1.69 |
     |    0004 | 19.95 |

The Rows Holding the Group-wise Maximum of a Certain Field
----------------------------------------------------------

"For each article, find the dealer(s) with the most expensive price."

In ANSI SQL, I'd do it with a sub-query like this:

     SELECT article, dealer, price
     FROM   shop s1
     WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
                   FROM shop s2
                   WHERE s1.article = s2.article);

In MySQL it's best do it in several steps:

  1. Get the list of (article,maxprice).

  2. For each article get the corresponding rows that have the stored
     maximum price.

This can easily be done with a temporary table:

     CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp (
             article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
             price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL);
     
     LOCK TABLES shop read;
     
     INSERT INTO tmp SELECT article, MAX(price) FROM shop GROUP BY article;
     
     SELECT shop.article, dealer, shop.price FROM shop, tmp
     WHERE shop.article=tmp.article AND shop.price=tmp.price;
     
     UNLOCK TABLES;
     
     DROP TABLE tmp;

If you don't use a `TEMPORARY' table, you must also lock the 'tmp'
table.

"Can it be done with a single query?"

Yes, but only by using a quite inefficient trick that I call the
"MAX-CONCAT trick":

     SELECT article,
            SUBSTRING( MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 7) AS dealer,
       0.00+LEFT(      MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 6) AS price
     FROM   shop
     GROUP BY article;
     
     +---------+--------+-------+
     | article | dealer | price |
     +---------+--------+-------+
     |    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
     |    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
     |    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
     |    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
     +---------+--------+-------+

The last example can, of course, be made a bit more efficient by doing
the splitting of the concatenated column in the client.

Using user variables
--------------------

You can use MySQL user variables to remember results without having to
store them in temporary variables in the client.  *Note Variables::.

For example, to find the articles with the highest and lowest price you
can do:

     select @min_price:=min(price),@max_price:=max(price) from shop;
     select * from shop where price=@min_price or price=@max_price;
     
     +---------+--------+-------+
     | article | dealer | price |
     +---------+--------+-------+
     |    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
     |    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
     +---------+--------+-------+


File: mysql.info,  Node: example-Foreign keys,  Next: Searching on two keys,  Prev: example-user-variables,  Up: Examples

Using Foreign Keys
------------------

You don't need foreign keys to join 2 tables.

The only thing MySQL doesn't do is `CHECK' to make sure that the keys
you use really exist in the table(s) you're referencing and it doesn't
automatically delete rows from table with a foreign key definition. If
you use your keys like normal, it'll work just fine:

     CREATE TABLE persons (
         id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
         name CHAR(60) NOT NULL,
         PRIMARY KEY (id)
     );
     
     CREATE TABLE shirts (
         id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
         style ENUM('t-shirt', 'polo', 'dress') NOT NULL,
         color ENUM('red', 'blue', 'orange', 'white', 'black') NOT NULL,
         owner SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL REFERENCES persons,
         PRIMARY KEY (id)
     );
     
     
     INSERT INTO persons VALUES (NULL, 'Antonio Paz');
     
     INSERT INTO shirts VALUES
     (NULL, 'polo', 'blue', LAST_INSERT_ID()),
     (NULL, 'dress', 'white', LAST_INSERT_ID()),
     (NULL, 't-shirt', 'blue', LAST_INSERT_ID());

     INSERT INTO shirts VALUES
     (NULL, 'dress', 'orange', LAST_INSERT_ID()),
     (NULL, 'polo', 'red', LAST_INSERT_ID()),
     (NULL, 'dress', 'blue', LAST_INSERT_ID()),
     (NULL, 't-shirt', 'white', LAST_INSERT_ID());
     
     
     SELECT * FROM persons;

     SELECT s.* FROM persons p, shirts s
      WHERE p.name LIKE 'Lilliana%'
        AND s.owner = p.id
        AND s.color <> 'white';

File: mysql.info,  Node: Searching on two keys,  Next: Calculating days,  Prev: example-Foreign keys,  Up: Examples

Searching on Two Keys
---------------------

MySQL doesn't yet optimize when you search on two different keys
combined with `OR' (Searching on one key with different `OR' parts is
optimized quite good):

     SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1'
     OR  field2_index = '1'

The reason is that we haven't yet had time to come up with an efficient
way to handle this in the general case. (The `AND' handling is, in
comparison, now completely general and works very well).

For the moment you can solve this very efficiently by using a
`TEMPORARY' table. This type of optimization is also very good if you
are using very complicated queries where the SQL server does the
optimizations in the wrong order.

     CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp
     SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1';
     INSERT INTO tmp
     SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
     SELECT * from tmp;
     DROP TABLE tmp;

The above way to solve this query is in effect an `UNION' of two
queries.

Calculating visits per day
--------------------------

The following shows an idea of how you can use the bit group functions
to calculate the number of days per month a user has visited a web page.

     CREATE TABLE t1 (year YEAR(4), month INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL, day INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL);
     INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2000,1,1),(2000,1,20),(2000,1,30),(2000,2,2),(2000,2,23),(2000,2,23);
     
     SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_OR(1<<day)) AS days FROM t1 GROUP BY year,month;
     
     Which returns:
     
     +------+-------+------+
     | year | month | days |
     +------+-------+------+
     | 2000 |    01 |    3 |
     | 2000 |    02 |    2 |
     +------+-------+------+

The above calculates how many different days was used for a given
year/month combination, with automatic removal of duplicate entries.

Using `mysql' in Batch Mode
===========================

In the previous sections, you used `mysql' interactively to enter
queries and view the results.  You can also run `mysql' in batch mode.
To do this, put the commands you want to run in a file, then tell
`mysql' to read its input from the file:

     shell> mysql < batch-file

If you need to specify connection parameters on the command line, the
command might look like this:

     shell> mysql -h host -u user -p < batch-file
     Enter password: ********

When you use `mysql' this way, you are creating a script file, then
executing the script.

Why use a script?  Here are a few reasons:

   * If you run a query repeatedly (say, every day or every week),
     making it a script allows you to avoid retyping it each time you
     execute it.

   * You can generate new queries from existing ones that are similar
     by copying and editing script files.

   * Batch mode can also be useful while you're developing a query,
     particularly for multiple-line commands or multiple-statement
     sequences of commands.  If you make a mistake, you don't have to
     retype everything.  Just edit your script to correct the error,
     then tell `mysql' to execute it again.

   * If you have a query that produces a lot of output, you can run the
     output through a pager rather than watching it scroll off the top
     of your screen:

          shell> mysql < batch-file | more

   * You can catch the output in a file for further processing:

          shell> mysql < batch-file > mysql.out

   * You can distribute your script to other people so they can run the
     commands, too.

   * Some situations do not allow for interactive use, for example,
     when you run a query from a `cron' job.  In this case, you must
     use batch mode.

The default output format is different (more concise) when you run
`mysql' in batch mode than when you use it interactively.  For example,
the output of `SELECT DISTINCT species FROM pet' looks like this when
run interactively:

     +---------+
     | species |
     +---------+
     | bird    |
     | cat     |
     | dog     |
     | hamster |
     | snake   |
     +---------+

But like this when run in batch mode:

     species
     bird
     cat
     dog
     hamster
     snake

If you want to get the interactive output format in batch mode, use
`mysql -t'.  To echo to the output the commands that are executed, use
`mysql -vvv'.

Queries from Twin Project
=========================

At Analytikerna and Lentus, we have been doing the systems and field
work for a big research project. This project is a collaboration
between the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska
Institutet Stockholm and the Section on Clinical Research in Aging and
Psychology at the University of Southern California.

The project involves a screening part where all twins in Sweden older
than 65 years are interviewed by telephone. Twins who meet certain
criteria are passed on to the next stage. In this latter stage, twins
who want to participate are visited by a doctor/nurse team. Some of the
examinations include physical and neuropsychological examination,
laboratory testing, neuroimaging, psychological status assessment, and
family history collection. In addition, data are collected on medical
and environmental risk factors.

More information about Twin studies can be found at:

     <http://www.imm.ki.se/TWIN/TWINUKW.HTM>

The latter part of the project is administered with a Web interface
written using Perl and MySQL.

Each night all data from the interviews are moved into a MySQL database.

* Menu:

* Twin pool::                   Find all non-distributed twins
* Twin event::                  Show a table on twin pair status

             or h.status = 'Died' or h.status = 'Other')
     order by
             tvid;

Some explanations:
`concat(p1.id, p1.tvab) + 0 as tvid'
     We want to sort on the concatenated `id' and `tvab' in numerical
     order. Adding `0' to the result causes MySQL to treat the result
     as a number.

column `id'
     This identifies a pair of twins. It is a key in all tables.

column `tvab'
     This identifies a twin in a pair. It has a value of `1' or `2'.

column `ptvab'
     This is an inverse of `tvab'. When `tvab' is `1' this is `2', and
     vice versa. It exists to save typing and to make it easier for
     MySQL to optimize the query.

This query demonstrates, among other things, how to do lookups on a
table from the same table with a join (`p1' and `p2'). In the example,
this is used to check whether a twin's partner died before the age of
65. If so, the row is not returned.

All of the above exist in all tables with twin-related information. We
have a key on both `id,tvab' (all tables), and `id,ptvab'
(`person_data') to make queries faster.

On our production machine (A 200MHz UltraSPARC), this query returns
about 150-200 rows and takes less than one second.

The current number of records in the tables used above:
*Table*                *Rows*
`person_data'          71074
`lentus'               5291

Show a Table on Twin Pair Status
--------------------------------

Each interview ends with a status code called `event'. The query shown
below is used to display a table over all twin pairs combined by event.
This indicates in how many pairs both twins are finished, in how many
pairs one twin is finished and the other refused, and so on.

     select
             t1.event,
             t2.event,
             count(*)
     from
             lentus as t1,
             lentus as t2,
             twin_project as tp
     where
             /* We are looking at one pair at a time */
             t1.id = tp.id
             and t1.tvab=tp.tvab
             and t1.id = t2.id
             /* Just the sceening survey */
             and tp.survey_no = 5
             /* This makes each pair only appear once */
             and t1.tvab='1' and t2.tvab='2'
     group by
             t1.event, t2.event;

Using MySQL with Apache
=======================

The Contrib section includes programs that let you authenticate your
users from a MySQL database and also let you log your log files into a
MySQL table. *Note Contrib::.

You can change the Apache logging format to be easily readable by MySQL
by putting the following into the Apache configuration file:

     LogFormat \
             "\"%h\",%{%Y%m%d%H%M%S}t,%>s,\"%b\",\"%{Content-Type}o\",  \
             \"%U\",\"%{Referer}i\",\"%{User-Agent}i\""

In MySQL you can do something like this:

     LOAD DATA INFILE '/local/access_log' INTO TABLE table_name
     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\'

mysqld Command-line Options
---------------------------

`mysqld' accepts the following command-line options:

`--ansi'
     Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax.  *Note ANSI mode::.

`-b, --basedir=path'
     Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved
     relative to this.

`--big-tables'
     Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on file.  It
     solves most 'table full' errors, but also slows down the queries
     where in-memory tables would suffice.  Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL
     is able to solve it automatically by using memory for small
     temporary tables and switching to disk tables where necessary.

`--bind-address=IP'
     IP address to bind to.

`--character-sets-dir=path'
     Directory where character sets are.  *Note Character sets::.

`--chroot=path'
     Chroot `mysqld' daemon during startup.  Recommended security
     measure. It will somewhat limit `LOAD DATA INFILE' and `SELECT ...
     INTO OUTFILE' though.

`--core-file'
     Write a core file if `mysqld' dies.  For some systems you must also
     specify `--core-file-size' to `safe_mysqld'. *Note `safe_mysqld':
     safe_mysqld.

`-h, --datadir=path'
     Path to the database root.

`--default-character-set=charset'
     Set the default character set.  *Note Character sets::.

`--default-table-type=type'
     Set the default table type for tables.  *Note Table types::.

`--debug[...]='
     If MySQL is configured with `--with-debug', you can use this
     option to get a trace file of what `mysqld' is doing.  *Note
     Making trace files::.

`--delay-key-write-for-all-tables'
     Don't flush key buffers between writes for any `MyISAM' table.
     *Note Server parameters::.

`--enable-locking'
     Enable system locking.  Note that if you use this option on a
     system which a not fully working lockd() (as on Linux) you will
     easily get mysqld to deadlock.

`--enable-named-pipe'
     Enable support for named pipes (only on NT/Win2000/XP).

`-T, --exit-info'
     This is a bit mask of different flags one can use for debugging the
     mysqld server;  One should not use this option if one doesn't know
     exactly what it does!

`--flush'
     Flush all changes to disk after each SQL command.  Normally MySQL
     only does a write of all changes to disk after each SQL command
     and lets the operating system handle the syncing to disk.  *Note
     Crashing::.

`-?, --help'
     Display short help and exit.

`--init-file=file'
     Read SQL commands from this file at startup.

`-L, --language=...'
     Client error messages in given language.  May be given as a full
     path.  *Note Languages::.

`-l, --log[=file]'
     Log connections and queries to file. *Note Query log::.

`--log-isam[=file]'
     Log all ISAM/MyISAM changes to file (only used when debugging
     ISAM/MyISAM).

`--log-slow-queries[=file]'
     Log all queries that have taken more than `long_query_time'
     seconds to execute to file.  *Note Slow query log::.

`--log-update[=file]'
     Log updates to `file.#' where `#' is a unique number if not given.
     *Note Update log::.

`--log-long-format'
     Log some extra information to update log.  If you are using
     `--log-slow-queries' then queries that are not using indexes are
     logged to the slow query log.

`--low-priority-updates'
     Table-modifying operations (`INSERT'/`DELETE'/`UPDATE') will have
     lower priority than selects.  It can also be done via `{INSERT |
     REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...' to lower the priority
     of only one query, or by `SET OPTION SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1'
     to change the priority in one thread.  *Note Table locking::.

`--memlock'
     Lock the `mysqld' process in memory.  This works only if your
     system supports the `mlockall()' system call (like Solaris).  This
     may help if you have a problem where the operating system is
     causing `mysqld' to swap on disk.

`--myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]] where option is any combination'
     of `DEFAULT', `BACKUP', `FORCE' or `QUICK'.  You can also set this
     explicitely to `""' if you want to disable this option. If this
     option is used, `mysqld' will on open check if the table is marked
     as crashed or if if the table wasn't closed properly.  (The last
     option only works if you are running with `--skip-locking').  If
     this is the case `mysqld' will run check on the table. If the
     table was corrupted, `mysqld' will attempt to repair it.

     The following options affects how the repair works.

     DEFAULT              The same as not giving any option to
                                   `--myisam-recover'.
     BACKUP               If the data table was changed during recover,
                          save a                     backup of the
                          `table_name.MYD' data file as
                            `table_name-datetime.BAK'.
     FORCE                Run recover even if we will loose more than
                          one row                     from the .MYD file.
     QUICK                Don't check the rows in the table if there
                          isn't any                     delete blocks.

     Before a table is automatically repaired, MySQL will add a note
     about this in the error log.  If you want to be able to recover
     from most things without user intervention, you should use the
     options `BACKUP,FORCE'.  This will force a repair of a table even
     if some rows would be deleted, but it will keep the old data file
     as a backup so that you can later examine what happened.

`--pid-file=path'
     Path to pid file used by `safe_mysqld'.

`-P, --port=...'
     Port number to listen for TCP/IP connections.

`-o, --old-protocol'
     Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility with some very old clients.
     *Note Upgrading-from-3.20::.

`--one-thread'
     Only use one thread (for debugging under Linux).  *Note Debugging
     server::.

`-O, --set-variable var=option'
     Give a variable a value. `--help' lists variables.  You can find a
     full description for all variables in the `SHOW VARIABLES' section
     in this manual.  *Note SHOW VARIABLES::.  The tuning server
     parameters section includes information of how to optimize these.
     *Note Server parameters::.

`--safe-mode'
     Skip some optimize stages.  Implies `--skip-delay-key-write'.

`--safe-show-database'
     Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any
     privileges.

`--safe-user-create'
     If this is enabled, a user can't create new users with the GRANT
     command, if the user doesn't have `INSERT' privilege to the
     `mysql.user' table or any column in this table.

`--skip-concurrent-insert'
     Turn off the ability to select and insert at the same time on
     `MyISAM' tables. (This is only to be used if you think you have
     found a bug in this feature).

`--skip-delay-key-write'
     Ignore the `delay_key_write' option for all tables.  *Note Server
     parameters::.

`--skip-grant-tables'
     This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at
     all.  This gives everyone _full access_ to all databases!  (You
     can tell a running server to start using the grant tables again by
     executing `mysqladmin flush-privileges' or `mysqladmin reload'.)

`--skip-host-cache'
     Never use host name cache for faster name-ip resolution, but query
     DNS server on every connect instead.  *Note DNS::.

`--skip-locking'
     Don't use system locking.  To use `isamchk' or `myisamchk' you must
     shut down the server.  *Note Stability::.  Note that in MySQL
     Version 3.23 you can use `REPAIR' and `CHECK' to repair/check
     `MyISAM' tables.

`--skip-name-resolve'
     Hostnames are not resolved.  All `Host' column values in the grant
     tables must be IP numbers or `localhost'.  *Note DNS::.

`--skip-networking'
     Don't listen for TCP/IP connections at all.  All interaction with
     `mysqld' must be made via Unix sockets.  This option is highly
     recommended for systems where only local requests are allowed.
     *Note DNS::.

`--skip-new'
     Don't use new, possible wrong routines.  Implies
     `--skip-delay-key-write'.  This will also set default table type
     to `ISAM'.  *Note ISAM::.

`--skip-symlink'
     Don't delete or rename files that a symlinked file in the data
     directory points to.

`--skip-safemalloc'
     If MySQL is configured with `--with-debug=full', all programs will
     check the memory for overruns for every memory allocation and
     memory freeing.  As this checking is very slow, you can avoid
     this, when you don't need memory checking, by using this option.

`--skip-show-database'
     Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands, unless the user has *process*
     privilege.

`--skip-stack-trace'
     Don't write stack traces.  This option is useful when you are
     running `mysqld' under a debugger. *Note Debugging server::.

`--skip-thread-priority'
     Disable using thread priorities for faster response time.

`--socket=path'
     Socket file to use for local connections instead of default
     `/tmp/mysql.sock'.

`--sql-mode=option[,option[,option...]]'
     Option can be any combination of: `REAL_AS_FLOAT',
     `PIPES_AS_CONCAT', `ANSI_QUOTES', `IGNORE_SPACE', `SERIALIZE',
     `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY'.  It can also be empty (`""') if you want to
     reset this.

     By specifying all of the above options is same as using -ansi.
     With this option one can turn on only needed SQL modes. *Note ANSI
     mode::.

`transaction-isolation= { READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE }'
     Sets the default transaction isolation level.  *Note SET
     TRANSACTION::.

`-t, --tmpdir=path'
     Path for temporary files. It may be useful if your default `/tmp'
     directory resides on a partition too small to hold temporary
     tables.

`-u, --user=user_name'
     Run `mysqld' daemon as user `user_name'.  This option is
     _mandatory_ when starting `mysqld' as root.

`-V, --version'
     Output version information and exit.

`-W, --warnings'
     Print out warnings like `Aborted connection...' to the `.err' file.
     *Note Communication errors::.

my.cnf Option Files
-------------------

MySQL can, since Version 3.22, read default startup options for the
server and for clients from option files.

MySQL reads default options from the following files on Unix:

*Filename*             *Purpose*
`/etc/my.cnf'          Global options
`DATADIR/my.cnf'       Server-specific options
`defaults-extra-file'  The file specified with -defaults-extra-file=#
`~/.my.cnf'            User-specific options

`DATADIR' is the MySQL data directory (typically
`/usr/local/mysql/data' for a binary installation or `/usr/local/var'
for a source installation).  Note that this is the directory that was
specified at configuration time, not the one specified with `--datadir'
when `mysqld' starts up!  (`--datadir' has no effect on where the
server looks for option files, because it looks for them before it
processes any command-line arguments.)

MySQL reads default options from the following files on Windows:

*Filename*             *Purpose*
`windows-system-directory\my.ini'Global options
`C:\my.cnf'            Global options
`C:\mysql\data\my.cnf' Server-specific options

Note that on Windows, you should specify all paths with `/' instead of
`\'. If you use `\', you need to specify this twice, as `\' is the
escape character in MySQL.

MySQL tries to read option files in the order listed above.  If
multiple option files exist, an option specified in a file read later
takes precedence over the same option specified in a file read earlier.
Options specified on the command line take precedence over options
specified in any option file.  Some options can be specified using
environment variables.  Options specified on the command line or in
option files take precedence over environment variable values. *Note
Environment variables::.

The following programs support option files:  `mysql', `mysqladmin',
`mysqld', `mysqldump', `mysqlimport', `mysql.server', `myisamchk', and
`myisampack'.

You can use option files to specify any long option that a program
supports!  Run the program with `--help' to get a list of available
options.

An option file can contain lines of the following forms:

`#comment'
     Comment lines start with `#' or `;'. Empty lines are ignored.

`[group]'
     `group' is the name of the program or group for which you want to
     set options.  After a group line, any `option' or `set-variable'
     lines apply to the named group until the end of the option file or
     another group line is given.

`option'
     This is equivalent to `--option' on the command line.

`option=value'
     This is equivalent to `--option=value' on the command line.

`set-variable = variable=value'
     This is equivalent to `--set-variable variable=value' on the
     command line.  This syntax must be used to set a `mysqld' variable.

The `client' group allows you to specify options that apply to all
MySQL clients (not `mysqld'). This is the perfect group to use to
specify the password you use to connect to the server.  (But make sure
the option file is readable and writable only by yourself.)

Note that for options and values, all leading and trailing blanks are
automatically deleted.  You may use the escape sequences `\b', `\t',
`\n', `\r', `\\', and `\s' in your value string (`\s' == blank).

Here is a typical global option file:

     [client]
     port=3306
     socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
     
     [mysqld]
     port=3306
     socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
     set-variable = key_buffer_size=16M
     set-variable = max_allowed_packet=1M
     
     [mysqldump]
     quick

Here is typical user option file:

     [client]
     # The following password will be sent to all standard MySQL clients
     password=my_password
     
     [mysql]
     no-auto-rehash
     set-variable = connect_timeout=2
     
     [mysqlhotcopy]
     interactive-timeout

If you have a source distribution, you will find sample configuration
files named `my-xxxx.cnf' in the `support-files' directory.  If you
have a binary distribution, look in the `DIR/support-files' directory,
where `DIR' is the pathname to the MySQL installation directory
(typically `/usr/local/mysql').  Currently there are sample
configuration files for small, medium, large, and very large systems.
You can copy `my-xxxx.cnf' to your home directory (rename the copy to
`.my.cnf') to experiment with this.

All MySQL clients that support option files support the following
options:

-no-defaults                  Don't read any option files.
-print-defaults               Print the program name and all options
                              that it will get.
-defaults-file=full-path-to-default-fileOnly use the given configuration file.
-defaults-extra-file=full-path-to-default-fileRead this configuration file after the
                              global configuration file but before the
                              user configuration file.

Note that the above options must be first on the command line to work!
`--print-defaults' may however be used directly after the
`--defaults-xxx-file' commands.

Note for developers:  Option file handling is implemented simply by
processing all matching options (that is, options in the appropriate
group) before any command-line arguments. This works nicely for
programs that use the last instance of an option that is specified
multiple times. If you have an old program that handles
multiply-specified options this way but doesn't read option files, you
need add only two lines to give it that capability.  Check the source
code of any of the standard MySQL clients to see how to do this.

In shell scripts you can use the `my_print_defaults' command to parse
the config files:


     shell> my_print_defaults client mysql
     --port=3306
     --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
     --no-auto-rehash

The above output contains all options for the groups 'client' and
'mysql'.

Installing Many Servers on the Same Machine
-------------------------------------------

In some cases you may want to have many different `mysqld' daemons
(servers) running on the same machine.  You may for example want to run
a new version of MySQL for testing together with an old version that is
in production.  Another case is when you want to give different users
access to different `mysqld' servers that they manage themselves.

One way to get a new server running is by starting it with a different
socket and port as follows:

     shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/tmp/mysqld-new.sock
     shell> MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307
     shell> export MYSQL_UNIX_PORT MYSQL_TCP_PORT
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> bin/safe_mysqld &

The environment variables appendix includes a list of other environment
variables you can use to affect `mysqld'. *Note Environment variables::.

The above is the quick and dirty way that one commonly uses for testing.
The nice thing with this is that all connections you do in the above
shell will automatically be directed to the new running server!

If you need to do this more permanently, you should create an option
file for each server. *Note Option files::.  In your startup script that
is executed at boot time (mysql.server?) you should specify for both
servers:

`safe_mysqld --default-file=path-to-option-file'

At least the following options should be different per server:

`port=#'

`socket=path'

`pid-file=path'
The following options should be different, if they are used:

`log=path'

`log-bin=path'

`log-update=path'

`log-isam=path'

`bdb-logdir=path'
If you want more performance, you can also specify the following
differently:

`tmpdir=path'

`bdb-tmpdir=path'
*Note Command-line options::.

If you are installing binary MySQL versions (.tar files) and start them
with `./bin/safe_mysqld' then in most cases the only option you need to
add/change is the `socket' and `port' argument to `safe_mysqld'.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Multiple servers,  Prev: Installing many servers,  Up: Configuring MySQL

Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine
--------------------------------------------------

There are circumstances when you might want to run multiple servers on
the same machine.  For example, you might want to test a new MySQL
release while leaving your existing production setup undisturbed.  Or
you might be an Internet service provider that wants to provide
independent MySQL installations for different customers.

If you want to run multiple servers, the easiest way is to compile the
servers with different TCP/IP ports and socket files so they are not
both listening to the same TCP/IP port or socket file. *Note
`mysqld_multi': mysqld_multi.

Assume an existing server is configured for the default port number and
socket file.  Then configure the new server with a `configure' command
something like this:

     shell> ./configure  --with-tcp-port=port_number \
                  --with-unix-socket-path=file_name \
                  --prefix=/usr/local/mysql-3.22.9

Here `port_number' and `file_name' should be different than the default
port number and socket file pathname, and the `--prefix' value should
specify an installation directory different than the one under which
the existing MySQL installation is located.

You can check the socket used by any currently executing MySQL server
with this command:

     shell> mysqladmin -h hostname --port=port_number variables

Note that if you specify "`localhost'" as a hostname, `mysqladmin' will
default to using Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP.

If you have a MySQL server running on the port you used, you will get a
list of some of the most important configurable variables in MySQL,
including the socket name.

You don't have to recompile a new MySQL server just to start with a
different port and socket.  You can change the port and socket to be
used by specifying them at run time as options to `safe_mysqld':

     shell> /path/to/safe_mysqld --socket=file_name --port=port_number

`mysqld_multi' can also take `safe_mysqld' (or `mysqld') as an argument
and pass the options from a configuration file to `safe_mysqld' and
further to `mysqld'.

If you run the new server on the same database directory as another
server with logging enabled, you should also specify the name of the log
files to `safe_mysqld' with `--log', `--log-update', or
`--log-slow-queries'.  Otherwise, both servers may be trying to write
to the same log file.

*WARNING*: Normally you should never have two servers that update data
in the same database!  If your OS doesn't support fault-free system
locking, this may lead to unpleasant surprises!

If you want to use another database directory for the second server, you
can use the `--datadir=path' option to `safe_mysqld'.

*NOTE* also that starting several MySQL servers (`mysqlds') in
different machines and letting them access one data directory over
`NFS' is generally a *BAD IDEA*! The problem is that the `NFS' will
become the bottleneck with the speed. It is not meant for such use. And
last but not least, you would still have to come up with a solution how
to make sure that two or more `mysqlds' are not interfering with each
other. At the moment there is no platform that would 100% reliable do
the file locking (`lockd' daemon usually) in every situation. Yet there
would be one more possible risk with `NFS'; it would make the work even
more complicated for `lockd' daemon to handle. So make it easy for your
self and forget about the idea. The working solution is to have one
computer with an operating system that efficiently handles threads and
have several CPUs in it.

When you want to connect to a MySQL server that is running with a
different port than the port that is compiled into your client, you can
use one of the following methods:

   * Start the client with `--host 'hostname' --port=port_number' to
     connect with TCP/IP, or `[--host localhost] --socket=file_name' to
     connect via a Unix socket.

   * In your C or Perl programs, you can give the port or socket
     arguments when connecting to the MySQL server.

   * If your are using the Perl `DBD::mysql' module you can read the
     options from the MySQL option files.  *Note Option files::.

          $dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf"
          $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);

   * Set the `MYSQL_UNIX_PORT' and `MYSQL_TCP_PORT' environment
     variables to point to the Unix socket and TCP/IP port before you
     start your clients.  If you normally use a specific socket or
     port, you should place commands to set these environment variables
     in your `.login' file.  *Note Environment variables::.

   * Specify the default socket and TCP/IP port in the `.my.cnf' file
     in your home directory. *Note Option files::.

General Security Guidelines
---------------------------

Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet should read
this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

In discussing security, we emphasize the necessity of fully protecting
the entire server host (not simply the MySQL server) against all types
of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering, playback, and denial of
service. We do not cover all aspects of availability and fault tolerance
here.

MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that a user may attempt to
perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts discussed here
are not specific to MySQL at all; the same general ideas apply to
almost all applications.

When running MySQL, follow these guidelines whenever possible:

   * DON'T EVER GIVE ANYONE (EXCEPT THE MySQL ROOT USER) ACCESS TO THE
     `user' TABLE IN THE `mysql' DATABASE!  The encrypted password is
     the real password in MySQL. If you know the password listed in the
     `user' table for a given user, you can easily log in as that user
     if you have access to the host listed for that account.

   * Learn the MySQL access privilege system. The `GRANT' and `REVOKE'
     commands are used for controlling access to MySQL. Do not grant
     any more privileges than necessary. Never grant privileges to all
     hosts.

     Checklist:
        - Try `mysql -u root'. If you are able to connect successfully
          to the server without being asked for a password, you have
          problems. Anyone can connect to your MySQL server as the MySQL
          `root' user with full privileges!  Review the MySQL
          installation instructions, paying particular attention to the
          item about setting a `root' password.

        - Use the command `SHOW GRANTS' and check to see who has access
          to what. Remove those privileges that are not necessary using
          the `REVOKE' command.

   * Do not keep any plain-text passwords in your database. When your
     computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list
     of passwords and use them. Instead use `MD5()' or another one-way
     hashing function.

   * Do not choose passwords from dictionaries. There are special
     programs to break them. Even passwords like "xfish98" are very
     bad.  Much better is "duag98" which contains the same word "fish"
     but typed one key to the left on a standard QWERTY keyboard.
     Another method is to use "Mhall" which is taken from the first
     characters of each word in the sentence "Mary had a little lamb."
     This is easy to remember and type, but difficult to guess for
     someone who does not know it.

   * Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of all
     types of exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the firewall
     or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).

     Checklist:
        - Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such as
          `nmap'. MySQL uses port 3306 by default. This port should be
          inaccessible from untrusted hosts. Another simple way to
          check whether or not your MySQL port is open is to try the
          following command from some remote machine, where
          `server_host' is the hostname of your MySQL server:

               shell> telnet server_host 3306

          If you get a connection and some garbage characters, the port
          is open, and should be closed on your firewall or router,
          unless you really have a good reason to keep it open. If
          `telnet' just hangs or the connection is refused, everything
          is OK; the port is blocked.

   * Do not trust any data entered by your users. They can try to trick
     your code by entering special or escaped character sequences in
     Web forms, URLs, or whatever application you have built. Be sure
     that your application remains secure if a user enters something
     like "`; DROP DATABASE mysql;'". This is an extreme example, but
     large security leaks and data loss may occur as a result of
     hackers using similar techniques, if you do not prepare for them.

     Also remember to check numeric data. A common mistake is to
     protect only strings. Sometimes people think that if a database
     contains only publicly available data that it need not be
     protected. This is incorrect. At least denial-of-service type
     attacks can be performed on such databases. The simplest way to
     protect from this type of attack is to use apostrophes around the
     numeric constants: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID='234'' rather
     than `SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234'.  MySQL automatically
     converts this string to a number and strips all non-numeric
     symbols from it.

     Checklist:
        - All Web applications:
             * Try to enter `'' and `"' in all your Web forms. If you
               get any kind of MySQL error, investigate the problem
               right away.

             * Try to modify any dynamic URLs by adding `%22' (`"'),
               `%23' (`#'), and `%27' (`'') in the URL.

             * Try to modify datatypes in dynamic URLs from numeric
               ones to character ones containing characters from
               previous examples. Your application should be safe
               against this and similar attacks.

             * Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols
               instead of numbers in numeric fields. Your application
               should remove them before passing them to MySQL or your
               application should generate an error. Passing unchecked
               values to MySQL is very dangerous!

             * Check data sizes before passing them to MySQL.

             * Consider having your application connect to the database
               using a different user name than the one you use for
               administrative purposes. Do not give your applications
               any more access privileges than they need.

        - Users of PHP:
             * Check out the `addslashes()' function.  As of PHP 4.0.3,
               a `mysql_escape_string()' function is available that is
               based on the function of the same name in the MySQL C
               API.

        - Users of MySQL C API:
             * Check out the `mysql_escape_string()' API call.

        - Users of MySQL++:
             * Check out the `escape' and `quote' modifiers for query
               streams.

        - Users of Perl DBI:
             * Check out the `quote()' method or use placeholders.

        - Users of Java JDBC:
             * Use a `PreparedStatement' object and placeholders.

   * Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet. These
     data are accessible to everyone who has the time and ability to
     intercept it and use it for their own purposes. Instead, use an
     encrypted protocol such as SSL or SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL
     connections as of Version 3.23.9.  SSH port-forwarding can be used
     to create an encrypted (and compressed) tunnel for the
     communication.

   * Learn to use the `tcpdump' and `strings' utilities. For most cases,
     you can check whether or not MySQL data streams are unencrypted by
     issuing a command like the following:

          shell> tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings

     (This works under Linux and should work with small modifications
     under other systems).  Warning: If you do not see data this
     doesn't always actually mean that it is encrypted. If you need
     high security, you should consult with a security expert.

How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers
-----------------------------------------

When you connect to a MySQL server, you normally should use a password.
The password is not transmitted in clear text over the connection,
however the encryption algorithm is not very strong, and with some
effort a clever attacker can crack the password if he is able to sniff
the traffic between the client and the server. If the connection
between the client and the server goes through an untrusted network,
you should use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the communication.

All other information is transferred as text that can be read by anyone
who is able to watch the connection.  If you are concerned about this,
you can use the compressed protocol (in MySQL Version 3.22 and above)
to make things much harder.  To make things even more secure you should
use `ssh'.  You can find an open source `ssh' client at
`http://www.openssh.org', and a commercial `ssh' client at
`http://www.ssh.com'.  With this, you can get an encrypted TCP/IP
connection between a MySQL server and a MySQL client.

To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

   * Use passwords for all MySQL users. Remember that anyone can log in
     as any other person as simply as `mysql -u other_user db_name' if
     `other_user' has no password.  It is common behavior with
     client/server applications that the client may specify any user
     name.  You can change the password of all users by editing the
     `mysql_install_db' script before you run it, or only the password
     for the MySQL `root' user like this:

          shell> mysql -u root mysql
          mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
                     WHERE user='root';
          mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   * Don't run the MySQL daemon as the Unix `root' user.  This is very
     dangerous, because any user with `FILE' privileges will be able to
     create files as `root' (for example, `~root/.bashrc'). To prevent
     this, `mysqld' will refuse to run as `root' unless it is specified
     directly using a `--user=root' option.

     `mysqld' can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user instead.  You
     can also create a new Unix user `mysql' to make everything even
     more secure.  If you run `mysqld' as another Unix user, you don't
     need to change the `root' user name in the `user' table, because
     MySQL user names have nothing to do with Unix user names.  To
     start `mysqld' as another Unix user, add a `user' line that
     specifies the user name to the `[mysqld]' group of the
     `/etc/my.cnf' option file or the `my.cnf' option file in the
     server's data directory. For example:

          [mysqld]
          user=mysql

     This will cause the server to start as the designated user whether
     you start it manually or by using `safe_mysqld' or `mysql.server'.
     For more details, see *Note Changing MySQL user: Changing MySQL
     user.

   * Don't support symlinks to tables (This can be disabled with the
     `--skip-symlink' option. This is especially important if you run
     `mysqld' as root as anyone that has write access to the mysqld data
     directories could then delete any file in the system!  *Note
     Symbolic links to tables::.

   * Check that the Unix user that `mysqld' runs as is the only user
     with read/write privileges in the database directories.

   * Don't give the *process* privilege to all users.  The output of
     `mysqladmin processlist' shows the text of the currently executing
     queries, so any user who is allowed to execute that command might
     be able to see if another user issues an `UPDATE user SET
     password=PASSWORD('not_secure')' query.

     `mysqld' reserves an extra connection for users who have the
     *process* privilege, so that a MySQL `root' user can log in and
     check things even if all normal connections are in use.

   * Don't give the *file* privilege to all users.  Any user that has
     this privilege can write a file anywhere in the file system with
     the privileges of the `mysqld' daemon!  To make this a bit safer,
     all files generated with `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' are readable to
     everyone, and you cannot overwrite existing files.

     The *file* privilege may also be used to read any file accessible
     to the Unix user that the server runs as.  This could be abused,
     for example, by using `LOAD DATA' to load `/etc/passwd' into a
     table, which can then be read with `SELECT'.

   * If you don't trust your DNS, you should use IP numbers instead of
     hostnames in the grant tables. In any case, you should be very
     careful about creating grant table entries using hostname values
     that contain wild cards!

   * If you want to restrict the number of connections for a single
     user, you can do this by setting the `max_user_connections'
     variable in `mysqld'.

Startup Options for `mysqld' Concerning Security
------------------------------------------------

The following `mysqld' options affect security:

`--safe-show-database'
     With this option, `SHOW DATABASES' returns only those databases
     for which the user has some kind of privilege.

`--safe-user-create'
     If this is enabled, an user can't create new users with the `GRANT'
     command, if the user doesn't have `INSERT' privilege to the
     `mysql.user' table.  If you want to give a user access to just
     create new users with those privileges that the user has right to
     grant, you should give the user the following privilege:

          GRANT INSERT(user) on mysql.user to 'user'h'ostname';

     This will ensure that the user can't change any privilege columns
     directly, but has to use the `GRANT' command to give privileges to
     other users.

`--skip-grant-tables'
     This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at
     all. This gives everyone _full access_ to all databases!  (You can
     tell a running server to start using the grant tables again by
     executing `mysqladmin flush-privileges' or `mysqladmin reload'.)

`--skip-name-resolve'
     Hostnames are not resolved.  All `Host' column values in the grant
     tables must be IP numbers or `localhost'.

`--skip-networking'
     Don't allow TCP/IP connections over the network.  All connections
     to `mysqld' must be made via Unix sockets. This option is
     unsuitable for systems that use MIT-pthreads, because the
     MIT-pthreads package doesn't support Unix sockets.

`--skip-show-database'
     With this option, the `SHOW DATABASES' statement doesn't return
     anything.

What the Privilege System Does
------------------------------

The primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to authenticate a
user connecting from a given host, and to associate that user with
privileges on a database such as *select*, *insert*, *update* and
*delete*.

Additional functionality includes the ability to have an anonymous user
and to grant privileges for MySQL-specific functions such as `LOAD DATA
INFILE' and administrative operations.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Privileges,  Next: Privileges provided,  Prev: What Privileges,  Up: Privilege system

How the Privilege System Works
------------------------------

The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may do exactly the
things that they are supposed to be allowed to do.  When you connect to
a MySQL server, your identity is determined by *the host from which you
connect* and *the user name you specify*.  The system grants privileges
according to your identity and *what you want to do*.

MySQL considers both your hostname and user name in identifying you
because there is little reason to assume that a given user name belongs
to the same person everywhere on the Internet.  For example, the user
`bill' who connects from `whitehouse.gov' need not be the same person
as the user `bill' who connects from `microsoft.com'.  MySQL handles
this by allowing you to distinguish users on different hosts that
happen to have the same name:  you can grant `bill' one set of
privileges for connections from `whitehouse.gov', and a different set
of privileges for connections from `microsoft.com'.

MySQL access control involves two stages:

   * Stage 1: The server checks whether or not you are even allowed to
     connect.

   * Stage 2: Assuming you can connect, the server checks each request
     you issue to see whether or not you have sufficient privileges to
     perform it.  For example, if you try to select rows from a table
     in a database or drop a table from the database, the server makes
     sure you have the *select* privilege for the table or the *drop*
     privilege for the database.

The server uses the `user', `db', and `host' tables in the `mysql'
database at both stages of access control.  The fields in these grant
tables are shown below:

*Table name*   `user'             `db'               `host'
*Scope         `Host'             `Host'             `Host'
fields*                                              
               `User'             `Db'               `Db'
               `Password'         `User'             
*Privilege     `Select_priv'      `Select_priv'      `Select_priv'
fields*                                              
               `Insert_priv'      `Insert_priv'      `Insert_priv'
               `Update_priv'      `Update_priv'      `Update_priv'
               `Delete_priv'      `Delete_priv'      `Delete_priv'
               `Index_priv'       `Index_priv'       `Index_priv'
               `Alter_priv'       `Alter_priv'       `Alter_priv'
               `Create_priv'      `Create_priv'      `Create_priv'
               `Drop_priv'        `Drop_priv'        `Drop_priv'
               `Grant_priv'       `Grant_priv'       `Grant_priv'
               `References_priv'                     
               `Reload_priv'                         
               `Shutdown_priv'                       
               `Process_priv'                        
               `File_priv'                           

For the second stage of access control (request verification), the
server may, if the request involves tables, additionally consult the
`tables_priv' and `columns_priv' tables.  The fields in these tables
are shown below:

*Table name*   `tables_priv'      `columns_priv'
*Scope         `Host'             `Host'
fields*                           
               `Db'               `Db'
               `User'             `User'
               `Table_name'       `Table_name'
                                  `Column_name'
*Privilege     `Table_priv'       `Column_priv'
fields*                           
               `Column_priv'      
*Other         `Timestamp'        `Timestamp'
fields*                           
               `Grantor'          

Each grant table contains scope fields and privilege fields.

Scope fields determine the scope of each entry in the tables, that is,
the context in which the entry applies.  For example, a `user' table
entry with `Host' and `User' values of `'thomas.loc.gov'' and `'bob''
would be used for authenticating connections made to the server by
`bob' from the host `thomas.loc.gov'.  Similarly, a `db' table entry
with `Host', `User', and `Db' fields of `'thomas.loc.gov'', `'bob'' and
`'reports'' would be used when `bob' connects from the host
`thomas.loc.gov' to access the `reports' database.  The `tables_priv'
and `columns_priv' tables contain scope fields indicating tables or
table/column combinations to which each entry applies.

For access-checking purposes, comparisons of `Host' values are case
insensitive.  `User', `Password', `Db', and `Table_name' values are
case sensitive.  `Column_name' values are case insensitive in MySQL
Version 3.22.12 or later.

Privilege fields indicate the privileges granted by a table entry, that
is, what operations can be performed.  The server combines the
information in the various grant tables to form a complete description
of a user's privileges.  The rules used to do this are described in
*Note Request access::.

Scope fields are strings, declared as shown below; the default value for
each is the empty string:

*Field      *Type*      
name*                   
`Host'      `CHAR(60)'  
`User'      `CHAR(16)'  
`Password'  `CHAR(16)'  
`Db'        `CHAR(64)'  (`CHAR(60)' for the `tables_priv' and
                        `columns_priv' tables)
`Table_name'`CHAR(60)'  
`Column_name'`CHAR(60)'  

In the `user', `db' and `host' tables, all privilege fields are
declared as `ENUM('N','Y')' -- each can have a value of `'N'' or `'Y'',
and the default value is `'N''.

In the `tables_priv' and `columns_priv' tables, the privilege fields
are declared as `SET' fields:

*Table name*   *Field name*   *Possible set elements*
`tables_priv'  `Table_priv'   `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'Delete',
                              'Create', 'Drop', 'Grant', 'References',
                              'Index', 'Alter''
`tables_priv'  `Column_priv'  `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update',
                              'References''
`columns_priv' `Column_priv'  `'Select', 'Insert', 'Update',
                              'References''

Briefly, the server uses the grant tables like this:

   * The `user' table scope fields determine whether to allow or reject
     incoming connections.  For allowed connections, any privileges
     granted in the `user' table indicate the user's global (superuser)
     privileges.  These privileges apply to *all* databases on the
     server.

   * The `db' and `host' tables are used together:

        - The `db' table scope fields determine which users can access
          which databases from which hosts.  The privilege fields
          determine which operations are allowed.

        - The `host' table is used as an extension of the `db' table
          when you want a given `db' table entry to apply to several
          hosts.  For example, if you want a user to be able to use a
          database from several hosts in your network, leave the `Host'
          value empty in the user's `db' table entry, then populate the
          `host' table with an entry for each of those hosts.  This
          mechanism is described more detail in *Note Request access::.

   * The `tables_priv' and `columns_priv' tables are similar to the
     `db' table, but are more fine-grained: they apply at the table and
     column levels rather than at the database level.

Note that administrative privileges (*reload*, *shutdown*, etc.) are
specified only in the `user' table.  This is because administrative
operations are operations on the server itself and are not
database-specific, so there is no reason to list such privileges in the
other grant tables.  In fact, only the `user' table need be consulted
to determine whether or not you can perform an administrative operation.

The *file* privilege is specified only in the `user' table, too.  It is
not an administrative privilege as such, but your ability to read or
write files on the server host is independent of the database you are
accessing.

The `mysqld' server reads the contents of the grant tables once, when it
starts up.  Changes to the grant tables take effect as indicated in
*Note Privilege changes::.

When you modify the contents of the grant tables, it is a good idea to
make sure that your changes set up privileges the way you want.  For
help in diagnosing problems, see *Note Access denied::.  For advice on
security issues, *note Security::.

A useful diagnostic tool is the `mysqlaccess' script, which Yves
Carlier has provided for the MySQL distribution.  Invoke `mysqlaccess'
with the `--help' option to find out how it works.  Note that
`mysqlaccess' checks access using only the `user', `db' and `host'
tables.  It does not check table- or column-level privileges.

Privileges Provided by MySQL
----------------------------

Information about user privileges is stored in the `user', `db',
`host', `tables_priv', and `columns_priv' tables in the `mysql'
database (that is, in the database named `mysql').  The MySQL server
reads the contents of these tables when it starts up and under the
circumstances indicated in *Note Privilege changes::.

The names used in this manual to refer to the privileges provided by
MySQL are shown below, along with the table column name associated with
each privilege in the grant tables and the context in which the
privilege applies:

*Privilege* *Column*           *Context*
*select*    `Select_priv'      tables
*insert*    `Insert_priv'      tables
*update*    `Update_priv'      tables
*delete*    `Delete_priv'      tables
*index*     `Index_priv'       tables
*alter*     `Alter_priv'       tables
*create*    `Create_priv'      databases, tables, or indexes
*drop*      `Drop_priv'        databases or tables
*grant*     `Grant_priv'       databases or tables
*references*`References_priv'  databases or tables
*reload*    `Reload_priv'      server administration
*shutdown*  `Shutdown_priv'    server administration
*process*   `Process_priv'     server administration
*file*      `File_priv'        file access on server

The *select*, *insert*, *update*, and *delete* privileges allow you to
perform operations on rows in existing tables in a database.

`SELECT' statements require the *select* privilege only if they
actually retrieve rows from a table.  You can execute certain `SELECT'
statements even without permission to access any of the databases on the
server.  For example, you could use the `mysql' client as a simple
calculator:

     mysql> SELECT 1+1;
     mysql> SELECT PI()*2;

The *index* privilege allows you to create or drop (remove) indexes.

The *alter* privilege allows you to use `ALTER TABLE'.

The *create* and *drop* privileges allow you to create new databases
and tables, or to drop (remove) existing databases and tables.

Note that if you grant the *drop* privilege for the `mysql' database to
a user, that user can drop the database in which the MySQL access
privileges are stored!

The *grant* privilege allows you to give to other users those
privileges you yourself possess.

The *file* privilege gives you permission to read and write files on
the server using the `LOAD DATA INFILE' and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE'
statements.  Any user to whom this privilege is granted can read or
write any file that the MySQL server can read or write.

The remaining privileges are used for administrative operations, which
are performed using the `mysqladmin' program.  The table below shows
which `mysqladmin' commands each administrative privilege allows you to
execute:

*Privilege* *Commands permitted to privilege holders*
*reload*    `reload', `refresh', `flush-privileges', `flush-hosts',
            `flush-logs', and `flush-tables'
*shutdown*  `shutdown'
*process*   `processlist', `kill'

The `reload' command tells the server to re-read the grant tables.  The
`refresh' command flushes all tables and opens and closes the log
files.  `flush-privileges' is a synonym for `reload'.  The other
`flush-*' commands perform functions similar to `refresh' but are more
limited in scope, and may be preferable in some instances.  For example,
if you want to flush just the log files, `flush-logs' is a better choice
than `refresh'.

The `shutdown' command shuts down the server.

The `processlist' command displays information about the threads
executing within the server.  The `kill' command kills server threads.
You can always display or kill your own threads, but you need the
*process* privilege to display or kill threads initiated by other
users. *Note KILL::.

It is a good idea in general to grant privileges only to those users
who need them, but you should exercise particular caution in granting
certain privileges:

   * The *grant* privilege allows users to give away their privileges to
     other users.  Two users with different privileges and with the
     *grant* privilege are able to combine privileges.

   * The *alter* privilege may be used to subvert the privilege system
     by renaming tables.

   * The *file* privilege can be abused to read any world-readable file
     on the server into a database table, the contents of which can
     then be accessed using `SELECT'. This includes the contents of all
     databases hosted by the server!

   * The *shutdown* privilege can be abused to deny service to other
     users entirely, by terminating the server.

   * The *process* privilege can be used to view the plain text of
     currently executing queries, including queries that set or change
     passwords.

   * Privileges on the `mysql' database can be used to change passwords
     and other access privilege information.  (Passwords are stored
     encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the
     plain text password).  If they can access the `mysql.user' password
     column, they can use it to log into the MySQL server for the given
     user.  (With sufficient privileges, the same user can replace a
     password with a different one.)

There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL privilege
system:

   * You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied
     access.  That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then
     refuse the connection.

   * You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop
     tables in a database but not to create or drop the database itself.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Connecting,  Next: Connection access,  Prev: Privileges provided,  Up: Privilege system

Connecting to the MySQL Server
------------------------------

MySQL client programs generally require that you specify connection
parameters when you want to access a MySQL server: the host you want to
connect to, your user name, and your password.  For example, the
`mysql' client can be started like this (optional arguments are enclosed
between `[' and `]'):

     shell> mysql [-h host_name] [-u user_name] [-pyour_pass]

Alternate forms of the `-h', `-u', and `-p' options are
`--host=host_name', `--user=user_name', and `--password=your_pass'.
Note that there is _no space_ between `-p' or `--password=' and the
password following it.

*NOTE:* Specifying a password on the command line is not secure!  Any
user on your system may then find out your password by typing a command
like: `ps auxww'.  *Note Option files::.

`mysql' uses default values for connection parameters that are missing
from the command line:

   * The default hostname is `localhost'.

   * The default user name is your Unix login name.

   * No password is supplied if `-p' is missing.

Thus, for a Unix user `joe', the following commands are equivalent:

     shell> mysql -h localhost -u joe
     shell> mysql -h localhost
     shell> mysql -u joe
     shell> mysql

Other MySQL clients behave similarly.

On Unix systems, you can specify different default values to be used
when you make a connection, so that you need not enter them on the
command line each time you invoke a client program.  This can be done
in a couple of ways:

   * You can specify connection parameters in the `[client]' section of
     the `.my.cnf' configuration file in your home directory.  The
     relevant section of the file might look like this:

          [client]
          host=host_name
          user=user_name
          password=your_pass

     *Note Option files::.

   * You can specify connection parameters using environment variables.
     The host can be specified for `mysql' using `MYSQL_HOST'.  The
     MySQL user name can be specified using `USER' (this is for Windows
     only).  The password can be specified using `MYSQL_PWD' (but this
     is insecure; see the next section).  *Note Environment variables::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Connection access,  Next: Request access,  Prev: Connecting,  Up: Privilege system

Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification
------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether or not you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.  If not, the
server denies access to you completely.  Otherwise, the server accepts
the connection, then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

   * The host from which you connect

   * Your MySQL user name

Identity checking is performed using the three `user' table scope fields
(`Host', `User', and `Password').  The server accepts the connection
only if a `user' table entry matches your hostname and user name, and
you supply the correct password.

Values in the `user' table scope fields may be specified as follows:

   * A `Host' value may be a hostname or an IP number, or `'localhost''
     to indicate the local host.

   * You can use the wild-card characters `%' and `_' in the `Host'
     field.

   * A `Host' value of `'%'' matches any hostname.

   * A blank `Host' value means that the privilege should be anded with
     the entry in the `host' table that matches the given host name.
     You can find more information about this in the next chapter.

   * As of MySQL Version 3.23, for `Host' values specified as IP
     numbers, you can specify a netmask indicating how many address
     bits to use for the network number. For example:

          GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on db.* to david@'192.58.197.0/255.255.255.0';

     This will allow everyone to connect from an IP where the following
     is true:

          user_ip & netmask = host_ip.

     In the above example all IP:s in the interval 192.58.197.0 -
     192.58.197.255 can connect to the MySQL server.

   * Wild-card characters are not allowed in the `User' field, but you
     can specify a blank value, which matches any name.  If the `user'
     table entry that matches an incoming connection has a blank user
     name, the user is considered to be the anonymous user (the user
     with no name), rather than the name that the client actually
     specified.  This means that a blank user name is used for all
     further access checking for the duration of the connection (that
     is, during Stage 2).

   * The `Password' field can be blank.  This does not mean that any
     password matches, it means the user must connect without
     specifying a password.

Non-blank `Password' values represent encrypted passwords.  MySQL does
not store passwords in plaintext form for anyone to see.  Rather, the
password supplied by a user who is attempting to connect is encrypted
(using the `PASSWORD()' function). The encrypted password is then used
when the client/server is checking if the password is correct (This is
done without the encrypted password ever traveling over the
connection.)  Note that from MySQL's point of view the encrypted
password is the REAL password, so you should not give anyone access to
it!  In particular, don't give normal users read access to the tables
in the `mysql' database!

The examples below show how various combinations of `Host' and `User'
values in `user' table entries apply to incoming connections:

`Host' *value*     `User'      *Connections matched by entry*
                   *value*     
`'thomas.loc.gov'' `'fred''    `fred', connecting from `thomas.loc.gov'
`'thomas.loc.gov'' `'''        Any user, connecting from `thomas.loc.gov'
`'%''              `'fred''    `fred', connecting from any host
`'%''              `'''        Any user, connecting from any host
`'%.loc.gov''      `'fred''    `fred', connecting from any host in the
                               `loc.gov' domain
`'x.y.%''          `'fred''    `fred', connecting from `x.y.net',
                               `x.y.com',`x.y.edu', etc. (this is
                               probably not useful)
`'144.155.166.177''`'fred''    `fred', connecting from the host with IP
                               address `144.155.166.177'
`'144.155.166.%''  `'fred''    `fred', connecting from any host in the
                               `144.155.166' class C subnet
`'144.155.166.0/255.255.255.0''`'fred''    Same as previous example

Because you can use IP wild-card values in the `Host' field (for
example, `'144.155.166.%'' to match every host on a subnet), there is
the possibility that someone might try to exploit this capability by
naming a host `144.155.166.somewhere.com'.  To foil such attempts, MySQL
disallows matching on hostnames that start with digits and a dot. Thus,
if you have a host named something like `1.2.foo.com', its name will
never match the `Host' column of the grant tables.  Only an IP number
can match an IP wild-card value.

An incoming connection may be matched by more than one entry in the
`user' table.  For example, a connection from `thomas.loc.gov' by
`fred' would be matched by several of the entries just shown above.  How
does the server choose which entry to use if more than one matches?  The
server resolves this question by sorting the `user' table after reading
it at startup time, then looking through the entries in sorted order
when a user attempts to connect.  The first matching entry is the one
that is used.

`user' table sorting works as follows.  Suppose the `user' table looks
like this:

     +-----------+----------+-
     | Host      | User     | ...
     +-----------+----------+-
     | %         | root     | ...
     | %         | jeffrey  | ...
     | localhost | root     | ...
     | localhost |          | ...
     +-----------+----------+-

When the server reads in the table, it orders the entries with the
most-specific `Host' values first (`'%'' in the `Host' column means
"any host" and is least specific).  Entries with the same `Host' value
are ordered with the most-specific `User' values first (a blank `User'
value means "any user" and is least specific).  The resulting sorted
`user' table looks like this:

     +-----------+----------+-
     | Host      | User     | ...
     +-----------+----------+-
     | localhost | root     | ...
     | localhost |          | ...
     | %         | jeffrey  | ...
     | %         | root     | ...
     +-----------+----------+-

When a connection is attempted, the server looks through the sorted
entries and uses the first match found.  For a connection from
`localhost' by `jeffrey', the entries with `'localhost'' in the `Host'
column match first.  Of those, the entry with the blank user name
matches both the connecting hostname and user name.  (The
`'%'/'jeffrey'' entry would have matched, too, but it is not the first
match in the table.)

Here is another example.  Suppose the `user' table looks like this:

     +----------------+----------+-
     | Host           | User     | ...
     +----------------+----------+-
     | %              | jeffrey  | ...
     | thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
     +----------------+----------+-

The sorted table looks like this:

     +----------------+----------+-
     | Host           | User     | ...
     +----------------+----------+-
     | thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
     | %              | jeffrey  | ...
     +----------------+----------+-

A connection from `thomas.loc.gov' by `jeffrey' is matched by the first
entry, whereas a connection from `whitehouse.gov' by `jeffrey' is
matched by the second.

A common misconception is to think that for a given user name, all
entries that explicitly name that user will be used first when the
server attempts to find a match for the connection.  This is simply not
true.  The previous example illustrates this, where a connection from
`thomas.loc.gov' by `jeffrey' is first matched not by the entry
containing `'jeffrey'' as the `User' field value, but by the entry with
no user name!

If you have problems connecting to the server, print out the `user'
table and sort it by hand to see where the first match is being made.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Request access,  Next: Access denied,  Prev: Connection access,  Up: Privilege system

Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification
---------------------------------------------

Once you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2.  For each
request that comes in on the connection, the server checks whether you
have sufficient privileges to perform it, based on the type of
operation you wish to perform.  This is where the privilege fields in
the grant tables come into play.  These privileges can come from any of
the `user', `db', `host', `tables_priv', or `columns_priv' tables.  The
grant tables are manipulated with `GRANT' and `REVOKE' commands.  *Note
`GRANT': GRANT.  (You may find it helpful to refer to *Note
Privileges::, which lists the fields present in each of the grant
tables.)

The `user' table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global
basis and that apply no matter what the current database is.  For
example, if the `user' table grants you the *delete* privilege, you can
delete rows from any database on the server host!  In other words,
`user' table privileges are superuser privileges.  It is wise to grant
privileges in the `user' table only to superusers such as server or
database administrators.  For other users, you should leave the
privileges in the `user' table set to `'N'' and grant privileges on a
database-specific basis only, using the `db' and `host' tables.

The `db' and `host' tables grant database-specific privileges.  Values
in the scope fields may be specified as follows:

   * The wild-card characters `%' and `_' can be used in the `Host' and
     `Db' fields of either table.

   * A `'%'' `Host' value in the `db' table means "any host." A blank
     `Host' value in the `db' table means "consult the `host' table for
     further information."

   * A `'%'' or blank `Host' value in the `host' table means "any host."

   * A `'%'' or blank `Db' value in either table means "any database."

   * A blank `User' value in either table matches the anonymous user.

The `db' and `host' tables are read in and sorted when the server
starts up (at the same time that it reads the `user' table).  The `db'
table is sorted on the `Host', `Db', and `User' scope fields, and the
`host' table is sorted on the `Host' and `Db' scope fields.  As with
the `user' table, sorting puts the most-specific values first and
least-specific values last, and when the server looks for matching
entries, it uses the first match that it finds.

The `tables_priv' and `columns_priv' tables grant table- and
column-specific privileges.  Values in the scope fields may be
specified as follows:

   * The wild-card characters `%' and `_' can be used in the `Host'
     field of either table.

   * A `'%'' or blank `Host' value in either table means "any host."

   * The `Db', `Table_name' and `Column_name' fields cannot contain
     wild cards or be blank in either table.

The `tables_priv' and `columns_priv' tables are sorted on the `Host',
`Db', and `User' fields.  This is similar to `db' table sorting,
although the sorting is simpler because only the `Host' field may
contain wild cards.

The request verification process is described below.  (If you are
familiar with the access-checking source code, you will notice that the
description here differs slightly from the algorithm used in the code.
The description is equivalent to what the code actually does; it
differs only to make the explanation simpler.)

For administrative requests (*shutdown*, *reload*, etc.), the server
checks only the `user' table entry, because that is the only table that
specifies administrative privileges.  Access is granted if the entry
allows the requested operation and denied otherwise.  For example, if
you want to execute `mysqladmin shutdown' but your `user' table entry
doesn't grant the *shutdown* privilege to you, access is denied without
even checking the `db' or `host' tables.  (They contain no
`Shutdown_priv' column, so there is no need to do so.)

For database-related requests (*insert*, *update*, etc.), the server
first checks the user's global (superuser) privileges by looking in the
`user' table entry.  If the entry allows the requested operation,
access is granted.  If the global privileges in the `user' table are
insufficient, the server determines the user's database-specific
privileges by checking the `db' and `host' tables:

  1. The server looks in the `db' table for a match on the `Host',
     `Db', and `User' fields.  The `Host' and `User' fields are matched
     to the connecting user's hostname and MySQL user name.  The `Db'
     field is matched to the database the user wants to access.  If
     there is no entry for the `Host' and `User', access is denied.

  2. If there is a matching `db' table entry and its `Host' field is
     not blank, that entry defines the user's database-specific
     privileges.

  3. If the matching `db' table entry's `Host' field is blank, it
     signifies that the `host' table enumerates which hosts should be
     allowed access to the database.  In this case, a further lookup is
     done in the `host' table to find a match on the `Host' and `Db'
     fields.  If no `host' table entry matches, access is denied.  If
     there is a match, the user's database-specific privileges are
     computed as the intersection (_not_ the union!) of the privileges
     in the `db' and `host' table entries, that is, the privileges that
     are `'Y'' in both entries.  (This way you can grant general
     privileges in the `db' table entry and then selectively restrict
     them on a host-by-host basis using the `host' table entries.)

After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the `db'
and `host' table entries, the server adds them to the global privileges
granted by the `user' table.  If the result allows the requested
operation, access is granted.  Otherwise, the server checks the user's
table and column privileges in the `tables_priv' and `columns_priv'
tables and adds those to the user's privileges.  Access is allowed or
denied based on the result.

Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a user's
privileges are calculated may be summarized like this:

     global privileges
     OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
     OR table privileges
     OR column privileges

It may not be apparent why, if the global `user' entry privileges are
initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the
server adds those privileges to the database-, table-, and
column-specific privileges later. The reason is that a request might
require more than one type of privilege.  For example, if you execute
an `INSERT ...  SELECT' statement, you need both *insert* and *select*
privileges.  Your privileges might be such that the `user' table entry
grants one privilege and the `db' table entry grants the other.  In
this case, you have the necessary privileges to perform the request,
but the server cannot tell that from either table by itself; the
privileges granted by the entries in both tables must be combined.

The `host' table can be used to maintain a list of secure servers.

At TcX, the `host' table contains a list of all machines on the local
network. These are granted all privileges.

You can also use the `host' table to indicate hosts that are _not_
secure.  Suppose you have a machine `public.your.domain' that is located
in a public area that you do not consider secure.  You can allow access
to all hosts on your network except that machine by using `host' table
entries like this:

     +--------------------+----+-
     | Host               | Db | ...
     +--------------------+----+-
     | public.your.domain | %  | ... (all privileges set to 'N')
     | %.your.domain      | %  | ... (all privileges set to 'Y')
     +--------------------+----+-

Naturally, you should always test your entries in the grant tables (for
example, using `mysqlaccess') to make sure your access privileges are
actually set up the way you think they are.

Causes of `Access denied' Errors
--------------------------------

If you encounter `Access denied' errors when you try to connect to the
MySQL server, the list below indicates some courses of action you can
take to correct the problem:

   * After installing MySQL, did you run the `mysql_install_db' script
     to set up the initial grant table contents?  If not, do so.  *Note
     Default privileges::.  Test the initial privileges by executing
     this command:

          shell> mysql -u root test

     The server should let you connect without error.  You should also
     make sure you have a file `user.MYD' in the MySQL database
     directory.  Ordinarily, this is `PATH/var/mysql/user.MYD', where
     `PATH' is the pathname to the MySQL installation root.

   * After a fresh installation, you should connect to the server and
     set up your users and their access permissions:

          shell> mysql -u root mysql

     The server should let you connect because the MySQL `root' user
     has no password initially.  That is also a security risk, so
     setting the `root' password is something you should do while
     you're setting up your other MySQL users.

     If you try to connect as `root' and get this error:

          Access denied for user: '@unknown' to database mysql

     this means that you don't have an entry in the `user' table with a
     `User' column value of `'root'' and that `mysqld' cannot resolve
     the hostname for your client.  In this case, you must restart the
     server with the `--skip-grant-tables' option and edit your
     `/etc/hosts' or `\windows\hosts' file to add an entry for your
     host.

   * If you get an error like the following:

          shell> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
          Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: YES)

     It means that you are using a wrong password. *Note Passwords::.

     If you have forgot the root password, you can restart `mysqld' with
     `--skip-grant-tables' to change the password. You can find more
     about this option later on in this manual section.

     If you get the above error even if you haven't specified a
     password, this means that you a wrong password in some `my.ini'
     file. *Note Option files::.  You can avoid using option files with
     the `--no-defaults' option, as follows:

          shell> mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root ver

   * If you updated an existing MySQL installation from a version
     earlier than Version 3.22.11 to Version 3.22.11 or later, did you
     run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script?  If not, do so.  The
     structure of the grant tables changed with MySQL Version 3.22.11
     when the `GRANT' statement became functional.

   * If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a
     session, it may be that a superuser has changed them.  Reloading
     the grant tables affects new client connections, but it also
     affects existing connections as indicated in *Note Privilege
     changes::.

   * If you can't get your password to work, remember that you must use
     the `PASSWORD()' function if you set the password with the
     `INSERT', `UPDATE', or `SET PASSWORD' statements.  The
     `PASSWORD()' function is unnecessary if you specify the password
     using the `GRANT ... INDENTIFIED BY' statement or the `mysqladmin
     password' command.  *Note Passwords::.

   * `localhost' is a synonym for your local hostname, and is also the
     default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host
     explicitly.  However, connections to `localhost' do not work if
     you are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads (`localhost'
     connections are made using Unix sockets, which are not supported
     by MIT-pthreads).  To avoid this problem on such systems, you
     should use the `--host' option to name the server host explicitly.
     This will make a TCP/IP connection to the `mysqld' server.  In
     this case, you must have your real hostname in `user' table
     entries on the server host.  (This is true even if you are running
     a client program on the same host as the server.)

   * If you get an `Access denied' error when trying to connect to the
     database with `mysql -u user_name db_name', you may have a problem
     with the `user' table. Check this by executing `mysql -u root
     mysql' and issuing this SQL statement:

          mysql> SELECT * FROM user;

     The result should include an entry with the `Host' and `User'
     columns matching your computer's hostname and your MySQL user name.

   * The `Access denied' error message will tell you who you are trying
     to log in as, the host from which you are trying to connect, and
     whether or not you were using a password. Normally, you should
     have one entry in the `user' table that exactly matches the
     hostname and user name that were given in the error message. For
     example if you get an error message that contains `Using password:
     NO', this means that you tried to login without an password.

   * If you get the following error when you try to connect from a
     different host than the one on which the MySQL server is running,
     then there is no row in the `user' table that matches that host:

          Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server

     You can fix this by using the command-line tool `mysql' (on the
     server host!) to add a row to the `user', `db', or `host' table
     for the user/hostname combination from which you are trying to
     connect and then execute `mysqladmin flush-privileges'.  If you are
     not running MySQL Version 3.22 and you don't know the IP number or
     hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you should
     put an entry with `'%'' as the `Host' column value in the `user'
     table and restart `mysqld' with the `--log' option on the server
     machine.  After trying to connect from the client machine, the
     information in the MySQL log will indicate how you really did
     connect.  (Then replace the `'%'' in the `user' table entry with
     the actual hostname that shows up in the log.  Otherwise, you'll
     have a system that is insecure.)

     Another reason for this error on Linux is that you are using a
     binary MySQL version that is compiled with a different glibc
     version than the one you are using.  In this case you should
     either upgrade your OS/glibc or download the source MySQL version
     and compile this yourself.  A source RPM is normally trivial to
     compile and install, so this isn't a big problem.

   * If you get an error message where the hostname is not shown or
     where the hostname is an IP, even if you try to connect with a
     hostname:

          shell> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some-hostname ver
          Access denied for user: 'root('Using password: YES)

     This means that MySQL got some error when trying to resolve the IP
     to a hostname.  In this case you can execute `mysqladmin
     flush-hosts' to reset the internal DNS cache. *Note DNS::.

     Some permanent solutions are:

        - Try to find out what is wrong with your DNS server and fix
          this.

        - Specify IPs instead of hostnames in the MySQL privilege
          tables.

        - Start `mysqld' with `--skip-name-resolve'.

        - Start `mysqld' with `--skip-host-cache'.

        - Connect to `localhost' if you are running the server and the
          client on the same machine.

        - Put the client machine names in `/etc/hosts'.

   * If `mysql -u root test' works but `mysql -h your_hostname -u root
     test' results in `Access denied', then you may not have the
     correct name for your host in the `user' table.  A common problem
     here is that the `Host' value in the user table entry specifies an
     unqualified hostname, but your system's name resolution routines
     return a fully qualified domain name (or vice-versa).  For
     example, if you have an entry with host `'tcx'' in the `user'
     table, but your DNS tells MySQL that your hostname is
     `'tcx.subnet.se'', the entry will not work. Try adding an entry to
     the `user' table that contains the IP number of your host as the
     `Host' column value.  (Alternatively, you could add an entry to the
     `user' table with a `Host' value that contains a wild card--for
     example, `'tcx.%''.  However, use of hostnames ending with `%' is
     _insecure_ and is _not_ recommended!)

   * If `mysql -u user_name test' works but `mysql -u user_name
     other_db_name' doesn't work, you don't have an entry for
     `other_db_name' listed in the `db' table.

   * If `mysql -u user_name db_name' works when executed on the server
     machine, but `mysql -u host_name -u user_name db_name' doesn't
     work when executed on another client machine, you don't have the
     client machine listed in the `user' table or the `db' table.

   * If you can't figure out why you get `Access denied', remove from
     the `user' table all entries that have `Host' values containing
     wild cards (entries that contain `%' or `_').  A very common error
     is to insert a new entry with `Host'=`'%'' and `User'=`'some
     user'', thinking that this will allow you to specify `localhost'
     to connect from the same machine.  The reason that this doesn't
     work is that the default privileges include an entry with
     `Host'=`'localhost'' and `User'=`'''.  Because that entry has a
     `Host' value `'localhost'' that is more specific than `'%'', it is
     used in preference to the new entry when connecting from
     `localhost'!  The correct procedure is to insert a second entry
     with `Host'=`'localhost'' and `User'=`'some_user'', or to remove
     the entry with `Host'=`'localhost'' and `User'=`'''.

   * If you get the following error, you may have a problem with the
     `db' or `host' table:

          Access to database denied

     If the entry selected from the `db' table has an empty value in the
     `Host' column, make sure there are one or more corresponding
     entries in the `host' table specifying which hosts the `db' table
     entry applies to.

     If you get the error when using the SQL commands `SELECT ...  INTO
     OUTFILE' or `LOAD DATA INFILE', your entry in the `user' table
     probably doesn't have the *file* privilege enabled.

   * Remember that client programs will use connection parameters
     specified in configuration files or environment variables.  *Note
     Environment variables::.  If a client seems to be sending the
     wrong default connection parameters when you don't specify them on
     the command line, check your environment and the `.my.cnf' file in
     your home directory.  You might also check the system-wide MySQL
     configuration files, though it is far less likely that client
     connection parameters will be specified there. *Note Option
     files::.  If you get `Access denied' when you run a client without
     any options, make sure you haven't specified an old password in
     any of your option files!  *Note Option files::.

   * If you make changes to the grant tables directly (using an
     `INSERT' or `UPDATE' statement) and your changes seem to be
     ignored, remember that you must issue a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES'
     statement or execute a `mysqladmin flush-privileges' command to
     cause the server to re-read the privilege tables.  Otherwise your
     changes have no effect until the next time the server is
     restarted.  Remember that after you set the `root' password with
     an `UPDATE' command, you won't need to specify it until after you
     flush the privileges, because the server won't know you've changed
     the password yet!

   * If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC
     program, try to connect to the server with `mysql -u user_name
     db_name' or `mysql -u user_name -pyour_pass db_name'.  If you are
     able to connect using the `mysql' client, there is a problem with
     your program and not with the access privileges.  (Note that there
     is no space between `-p' and the password; you can also use the
     `--password=your_pass' syntax to specify the password. If you use
     the `-p' option alone, MySQL will prompt you for the password.)

   * For testing, start the `mysqld' daemon with the
     `--skip-grant-tables' option.  Then you can change the MySQL grant
     tables and use the `mysqlaccess' script to check whether or not
     your modifications have the desired effect.  When you are
     satisfied with your changes, execute `mysqladmin flush-privileges'
     to tell the `mysqld' server to start using the new grant tables.
     *Note:* Reloading the grant tables overrides the
     `--skip-grant-tables' option.  This allows you to tell the server
     to begin using the grant tables again without bringing it down and
     restarting it.

   * If everything else fails, start the `mysqld' daemon with a
     debugging option (for example, `--debug=d,general,query'). This
     will print host and user information about attempted connections,
     as well as information about each command issued. *Note Making
     trace files::.

   * If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
     feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide

`GRANT' and `REVOKE' Syntax
---------------------------

     GRANT priv_type [(column_list)] [, priv_type [(column_list)] ...]
         ON {tbl_name | * | *.* | db_name.*}
         TO user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password']
             [, user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password'] ...]
         [WITH GRANT OPTION]
     
     REVOKE priv_type [(column_list)] [, priv_type [(column_list)] ...]
         ON {tbl_name | * | *.* | db_name.*}
         FROM user_name [, user_name ...]

`GRANT' is implemented in MySQL Version 3.22.11 or later. For earlier
MySQL versions, the `GRANT' statement does nothing.

The `GRANT' and `REVOKE' commands allow system administrators to create
users and grant and revoke rights to MySQL users at four privilege
levels:

*Global level*
     Global privileges apply to all databases on a given server. These
     privileges are stored in the `mysql.user' table.

*Database level*
     Database privileges apply to all tables in a given database. These
     privileges are stored in the `mysql.db' and `mysql.host' tables.

*Table level*
     Table privileges apply to all columns in a given table. These
     privileges are stored in the `mysql.tables_priv' table.

*Column level*
     Column privileges apply to single columns in a given table. These
     privileges are stored in the `mysql.columns_priv' table.

If you give a grant for a users that doesn't exists, that user is
created.  For examples of how `GRANT' works, see *Note Adding users::.

For the `GRANT' and `REVOKE' statements, `priv_type' may be specified
as any of the following:

     ALL PRIVILEGES      FILE                RELOAD
     ALTER               INDEX               SELECT
     CREATE              INSERT              SHUTDOWN
     DELETE              PROCESS             UPDATE
     DROP                REFERENCES          USAGE

`ALL' is a synonym for `ALL PRIVILEGES'.  `REFERENCES' is not yet
implemented.  `USAGE' is currently a synonym for "no privileges."  It
can be used when you want to create a user that has no privileges.

To revoke the *grant* privilege from a user, use a `priv_type' value of
`GRANT OPTION':

     REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON ... FROM ...;

The only `priv_type' values you can specify for a table are `SELECT',
`INSERT', `UPDATE', `DELETE', `CREATE', `DROP', `GRANT', `INDEX', and
`ALTER'.

The only `priv_type' values you can specify for a column (that is, when
you use a `column_list' clause) are `SELECT', `INSERT', and `UPDATE'.

You can set global privileges by using `ON *.*' syntax.  You can set
database privileges by using `ON db_name.*' syntax. If you specify `ON
*' and you have a current database, you will set the privileges for
that database.  (*WARNING:* If you specify `ON *' and you _don't_ have
a current database, you will affect the global privileges!)

In order to accommodate granting rights to users from arbitrary hosts,
MySQL supports specifying the `user_name' value in the form
`user@host'.  If you want to specify a `user' string containing special
characters (such as `-'), or a `host' string containing special
characters or wild-card characters (such as `%'), you can quote the
user or host name (for example, `'test-user'@'test-hostname'').

You can specify wild cards in the hostname.  For example,
`user@"%.loc.gov"' applies to `user' for any host in the `loc.gov'
domain, and `user@"144.155.166.%"' applies to `user' for any host in
the `144.155.166' class C subnet.

The simple form `user' is a synonym for `user@"%"'.  *NOTE:* If you
allow anonymous users to connect to the MySQL server (which is the
default), you should also add all local users as `user@localhost'
because otherwise the anonymous user entry for the local host in the
`mysql.user' table will be used when the user tries to log into the
MySQL server from the local machine!  Anonymous users are defined by
inserting entries with `User=''' into the `mysql.user' table. You can
verify if this applies to you by executing this query:

     mysql> SELECT Host,User FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';

For the moment, `GRANT' only supports host, table, database, and column
names up to 60 characters long. A user name can be up to 16 characters.

The privileges for a table or column are formed from the logical OR of
the privileges at each of the four privilege levels.  For example, if
the `mysql.user' table specifies that a user has a global *select*
privilege, this can't be denied by an entry at the database, table, or
column level.

The privileges for a column can be calculated as follows:

     global privileges
     OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
     OR table privileges
     OR column privileges

In most cases, you grant rights to a user at only one of the privilege
levels, so life isn't normally as complicated as above. The details of
the privilege-checking procedure are presented in *Note Privilege
system::.

If you grant privileges for a user/hostname combination that does not
exist in the `mysql.user' table, an entry is added and remains there
until deleted with a `DELETE' command.  In other words, `GRANT' may
create `user' table entries, but `REVOKE' will not remove them; you
must do that explicitly using `DELETE'.

In MySQL Version 3.22.12 or later, if a new user is created or if you
have global grant privileges, the user's password will be set to the
password specified by the `IDENTIFIED BY' clause, if one is given.  If
the user already had a password, it is replaced by the new one.

*WARNING:* If you create a new user but do not specify an `IDENTIFIED
BY' clause, the user has no password.  This is insecure.

Passwords can also be set with the `SET PASSWORD' command.  *Note `SET
OPTION': SET OPTION.

If you grant privileges for a database, an entry in the `mysql.db'
table is created if needed. When all privileges for the database have
been removed with `REVOKE', this entry is deleted.

If a user doesn't have any privileges on a table, the table is not
displayed when the user requests a list of tables (for example, with a
`SHOW TABLES' statement).

The `WITH GRANT OPTION' clause gives the user the ability to give to
other users any privileges the user has at the specified privilege
level.  You should be careful to whom you give the *grant* privilege,
as two users with different privileges may be able to join privileges!

You cannot grant another user a privilege you don't have yourself; the
*grant* privilege allows you to give away only those privileges you
possess.

Be aware that when you grant a user the *grant* privilege at a
particular privilege level, any privileges the user already possesses
(or is given in the future!) at that level are also grantable by that
user.  Suppose you grant a user the *insert* privilege on a database.
If you then grant the *select* privilege on the database and specify
`WITH GRANT OPTION', the user can give away not only the *select*
privilege, but also *insert*.  If you then grant the *update* privilege
to the user on the database, the user can give away the *insert*,
*select* and *update*.

You should not grant *alter* privileges to a normal user.  If you do
that, the user can try to subvert the privilege system by renaming
tables!

Note that if you are using table or column privileges for even one
user, the server examines table and column privileges for all users and
this will slow down MySQL a bit.

When `mysqld' starts, all privileges are read into memory.  Database,
table, and column privileges take effect at once, and user-level
privileges take effect the next time the user connects.  Modifications
to the grant tables that you perform using `GRANT' or `REVOKE' are
noticed by the server immediately.  If you modify the grant tables
manually (using `INSERT', `UPDATE', etc.), you should execute a `FLUSH
PRIVILEGES' statement or run `mysqladmin flush-privileges' to tell the
server to reload the grant tables.  *Note Privilege changes::.

The biggest differences between the ANSI SQL and MySQL versions of
`GRANT' are:

   * In MySQL privileges are given for an username + hostname
     combination and not only for an username.

   * ANSI SQL doesn't have global or database-level privileges, and
     ANSI SQL doesn't support all privilege types that MySQL supports.
     MySQL doesn't support the ANSI SQL `TRIGGER', `EXECUTE' or `UNDER'
     privileges.

   * ANSI SQL privileges are structured in a hierarchal manner. If you
     remove an user, all privileges the user has granted are revoked. In
     MySQL the granted privileges are not automatically revoked, but
     you have to revoke these yourself if needed.

   * If you in MySQL have the `INSERT' grant on only part of the
     columns in a table, you can execute `INSERT' statements on the
     table; The columns for which you don't have the `INSERT' privilege
     will set to their default values. ANSI SQL requires you to have the
     `INSERT' privilege on all columns.

   * When you drop a table in ANSI SQL, all privileges for the table
     are revoked.  If you revoke a privilege in ANSI SQL, all
     privileges that were granted based on this privilege are also
     revoked. In MySQL, privileges can be dropped only with explicit
     `REVOKE' commands or by manipulating the MySQL grant tables.

MySQL User Names and Passwords
------------------------------

There are several distinctions between the way user names and passwords
are used by MySQL and the way they are used by Unix or Windows:

   * User names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have
     nothing to do with Unix user names (login names) or Windows user
     names.  Most MySQL clients by default try to log in using the
     current Unix user name as the MySQL user name, but that is for
     convenience only.  Client programs allow a different name to be
     specified with the `-u' or `--user' options. This means that you
     can't make a database secure in any way unless all MySQL user
     names have passwords.  Anyone may attempt to connect to the server
     using any name, and they will succeed if they specify any name
     that doesn't have a password.

   * MySQL user names can be up to 16 characters long; Unix user names
     typically are limited to 8 characters.

   * MySQL passwords have nothing to do with Unix passwords.  There is
     no necessary connection between the password you use to log in to
     a Unix machine and the password you use to access a database on
     that machine.

   * MySQL encrypts passwords using a different algorithm than the one
     used during the Unix login process.  See the descriptions of the
     `PASSWORD()' and `ENCRYPT()' functions in *Note Miscellaneous
     functions::.  Note that even if the password is stored
     'scrambled', and knowing your 'scrambled' password is enough to be
     able to connect to the MySQL server!

MySQL users and their privileges are normally created with the `GRANT'
command. *Note GRANT::.

When you login to a MySQL server with a command line client you should
specify the password with `--password=your-password'.  *Note
Connecting::.

     mysql --user=monty --password=guess database_name

If you want the client to prompt for a password, you should use
`--password' without any argument

     mysql --user=monty --password database_name

or the short form:

     mysql -u monty -p database_name

Note that in the last example the password is *NOT* 'database_name'.

If you want to use the `-p' option to supply a password you should do so
like this:

     mysql -u monty -pguess database_name

On some systems, the library call that MySQL uses to prompt for a
password will automatically cut the password to 8 characters. Internally
MySQL doesn't have any limit for the length of the password.

When Privilege Changes Take Effect
----------------------------------

When `mysqld' starts, all grant table contents are read into memory and
become effective at that point.

Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using `GRANT',
`REVOKE', or `SET PASSWORD' are noticed by the server immediately.

If you modify the grant tables manually (using `INSERT', `UPDATE',
etc.), you should execute a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES' statement or run
`mysqladmin flush-privileges' or `mysqladmin reload' to tell the server
to reload the grant tables.  Otherwise your changes will have _no
effect_ until you restart the server. If you change the grant tables
manually but forget to reload the privileges, you will be wondering why
your changes don't seem to make any difference!

When the server notices that the grant tables have been changed,
existing client connections are affected as follows:

   * Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's
     next request.

   * Database privilege changes take effect at the next `USE db_name'
     command.

Global privilege changes and password changes take effect the next time
the client connects.

Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges
---------------------------------------

After installing MySQL, you set up the initial access privileges by
running `scripts/mysql_install_db'.  *Note Quick install::.  The
`mysql_install_db' script starts up the `mysqld' server, then
initializes the grant tables to contain the following set of privileges:

   * The MySQL `root' user is created as a superuser who can do
     anything.  Connections must be made from the local host.

     *NOTE:* The initial `root' password is empty, so anyone can
     connect as `root' _without a password_ and be granted all
     privileges.

   * An anonymous user is created that can do anything with databases
     that have a name of `'test'' or starting with `'test_''.
     Connections must be made from the local host.  This means any
     local user can connect without a password and be treated as the
     anonymous user.

   * Other privileges are denied.  For example, normal users can't use
     `mysqladmin shutdown' or `mysqladmin processlist'.

*NOTE:* The default privileges are different for Windows.  *Note
Windows running::.

Because your installation is initially wide open, one of the first
things you should do is specify a password for the MySQL `root' user.
You can do this as follows (note that you specify the password using
the `PASSWORD()' function):

     shell> mysql -u root mysql
     mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
                WHERE user='root';
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

You can, in MySQL Version 3.22 and above, use the `SET PASSWORD'
statement:

     shell> mysql -u root mysql
     mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR root=PASSWORD('new_password');

Another way to set the password is by using the `mysqladmin' command:

     shell> mysqladmin -u root password new_password

Only users with write/update access to the `mysql' database can change
the password for others users.  All normal users (not anonymous ones)
can only change their own password with either of the above commands or
with `SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new password')'.

Note that if you update the password in the `user' table directly using
the first method, you must tell the server to re-read the grant tables
(with `FLUSH PRIVILEGES'), because the change will go unnoticed
otherwise.

Once the `root' password has been set, thereafter you must supply that
password when you connect to the server as `root'.

You may wish to leave the `root' password blank so that you don't need
to specify it while you perform additional setup or testing. However,
be sure to set it before using your installation for any real
production work.

See the `scripts/mysql_install_db' script to see how it sets up the
default privileges.  You can use this as a basis to see how to add
other users.

If you want the initial privileges to be different than those just
described above, you can modify `mysql_install_db' before you run it.

To re-create the grant tables completely, remove all the `.frm',
`.MYI', and `.MYD' files in the directory containing the `mysql'
database.  (This is the directory named `mysql' under the database
directory, which is listed when you run `mysqld --help'.) Then run the
`mysql_install_db' script, possibly after editing it first to have the
privileges you want.

*NOTE:* For MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10, you should NOT
delete the `.frm' files.  If you accidentally do this, you should copy
them back from your MySQL distribution before running
`mysql_install_db'.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Adding users,  Next: Passwords,  Prev: Default privileges,  Up: User Account Management

Adding New Users to MySQL
-------------------------

You can add users two different ways: by using `GRANT' statements or by
manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly.  The preferred method is
to use `GRANT' statements, because they are more concise and less
error-prone. *Note GRANT::.

There is also a lot of contributed programs like `phpmyadmin' that can
be used to create and administrate users. *Note Contrib::.

The examples below show how to use the `mysql' client to set up new
users.  These examples assume that privileges are set up according to
the defaults described in the previous section.  This means that to
make changes, you must be on the same machine where `mysqld' is
running, you must connect as the MySQL `root' user, and the `root' user
must have the *insert* privilege for the `mysql' database and the
*reload* administrative privilege.  Also, if you have changed the
`root' user password, you must specify it for the `mysql' commands
below.

You can add new users by issuing `GRANT' statements:

     shell> mysql --user=root mysql
     mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@localhost
                IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@"%"
                IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     mysql> GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO admin@localhost;
     mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO dummy@localhost;

These `GRANT' statements set up three new users:

`monty'
     A full superuser who can connect to the server from anywhere, but
     who must use a password `'some_pass'' to do so.  Note that we must
     issue `GRANT' statements for both `monty@localhost' and
     `monty@"%"'.  If we don't add the entry with `localhost', the
     anonymous user entry for `localhost' that is created by
     `mysql_install_db' will take precedence when we connect from the
     local host, because it has a more specific `Host' field value and
     thus comes earlier in the `user' table sort order.

`admin'
     A user who can connect from `localhost' without a password and who
     is granted the *reload* and *process* administrative privileges.
     This allows the user to execute the `mysqladmin reload',
     `mysqladmin refresh', and `mysqladmin flush-*' commands, as well as
     `mysqladmin processlist' .  No database-related privileges are
     granted.  (They can be granted later by issuing additional `GRANT'
     statements.)

`dummy'
     A user who can connect without a password, but only from the local
     host.  The global privileges are all set to `'N'' -- the `USAGE'
     privilege type allows you to create a user with no privileges.  It
     is assumed that you will grant database-specific privileges later.

You can also add the same user access information directly by issuing
`INSERT' statements and then telling the server to reload the grant
tables:

     shell> mysql --user=root mysql
     mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES('localhost','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
                     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
     mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES('%','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
                     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
     mysql> INSERT INTO user SET Host='localhost',User='admin',
                      Reload_priv='Y', Process_priv='Y';
     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
                             VALUES('localhost','dummy','');
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Depending on your MySQL version, you may have to use a different number
of `'Y'' values above (versions prior to Version 3.22.11 had fewer
privilege columns).  For the `admin' user, the more readable extended
`INSERT' syntax that is available starting with Version 3.22.11 is used.

Note that to set up a superuser, you need only create a `user' table
entry with the privilege fields set to `'Y''.  No `db' or `host' table
entries are necessary.

The privilege columns in the `user' table were not set explicitly in the
last `INSERT' statement (for the `dummy' user), so those columns are
assigned the default value of `'N''.  This is the same thing that
`GRANT USAGE' does.

The following example adds a user `custom' who can connect from hosts
`localhost', `server.domain', and `whitehouse.gov'.  He wants to access
the `bankaccount' database only from `localhost', the `expenses'
database only from `whitehouse.gov', and the `customer' database from
all three hosts.  He wants to use the password `stupid' from all three
hosts.

To set up this user's privileges using `GRANT' statements, run these
commands:

     shell> mysql --user=root mysql
     mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
                ON bankaccount.*
                TO custom@localhost
                IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
     mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
                ON expenses.*
                TO custom@whitehouse.gov
                IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
     mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
                ON customer.*
                TO custom@'%'
                IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';

The reason that we do to grant statements for the user 'custom' is that
we want the give the user access to MySQL both from the local machine
with Unix sockets and from the remote machine 'whitehouse.gov' over
TCP/IP.

To set up the user's privileges by modifying the grant tables directly,
run these commands (note the `FLUSH PRIVILEGES' at the end):

     shell> mysql --user=root mysql
     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
            VALUES('localhost','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
            VALUES('server.domain','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
            VALUES('whitehouse.gov','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
     mysql> INSERT INTO db
            (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
             Create_priv,Drop_priv)
            VALUES
            ('localhost','bankaccount','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
     mysql> INSERT INTO db
            (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
             Create_priv,Drop_priv)
            VALUES
            ('whitehouse.gov','expenses','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
     mysql> INSERT INTO db
            (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
             Create_priv,Drop_priv)
            VALUES('%','customer','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

The first three `INSERT' statements add `user' table entries that allow
user `custom' to connect from the various hosts with the given
password, but grant no permissions to him (all privileges are set to the
default value of `'N'').  The next three `INSERT' statements add `db'
table entries that grant privileges to `custom' for the `bankaccount',
`expenses', and `customer' databases, but only when accessed from the
proper hosts.  As usual, when the grant tables are modified directly,
the server must be told to reload them (with `FLUSH PRIVILEGES') so
that the privilege changes take effect.

If you want to give a specific user access from any machine in a given
domain, you can issue a `GRANT' statement like the following:

     mysql> GRANT ...
                ON *.*
                TO myusername@"%.mydomainname.com"
                IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';

To do the same thing by modifying the grant tables directly, do this:

     mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ('%.mydomainname.com', 'myusername',
                PASSWORD('mypassword'),...);
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

You can also use `xmysqladmin', `mysql_webadmin', and even `xmysql' to
insert, change, and update values in the grant tables.  You can find
these utilities in the Contrib directory of the MySQL Website
(http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/).

Setting Up Passwords
--------------------

In most cases you should use `GRANT' to set up your users/passwords, so
the following only applies for advanced users. *Note `GRANT': GRANT.

The examples in the preceding sections illustrate an important
principle: when you store a non-empty password using `INSERT' or
`UPDATE' statements, you must use the `PASSWORD()' function to encrypt
it.  This is because the `user' table stores passwords in encrypted
form, not as plaintext.  If you forget that fact, you are likely to
attempt to set passwords like this:

     shell> mysql -u root mysql
     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
            VALUES('%','jeffrey','biscuit');
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

The result is that the plaintext value `'biscuit'' is stored as the
password in the `user' table.  When the user `jeffrey' attempts to
connect to the server using this password, the `mysql' client encrypts
it with `PASSWORD()', generates an authentification vector based on
*encrypted* password and a random number, obtained from server, and
sends the result to the server.  The server uses the `password' value
in the `user' table (that is *not encrypted* value `'biscuit'') to
perform the same calculations, and compares results.  The comparison
fails and the server rejects the connection:

     shell> mysql -u jeffrey -pbiscuit test
     Access denied

Passwords must be encrypted when they are inserted in the `user' table,
so the `INSERT' statement should have been specified like this instead:

     mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
            VALUES('%','jeffrey',PASSWORD('biscuit'));

You must also use the `PASSWORD()' function when you use `SET PASSWORD'
statements:

     mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR jeffrey@"%" = PASSWORD('biscuit');

If you set passwords using the `GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY' statement or
the `mysqladmin password' command, the `PASSWORD()' function is
unnecessary.  They both take care of encrypting the password for you,
so you would specify a password of `'biscuit'' like this:

     mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO jeffrey@"%" IDENTIFIED BY 'biscuit';

or

     shell> mysqladmin -u jeffrey password biscuit

*NOTE:* `PASSWORD()' does not perform password encryption in the same
way that Unix passwords are encrypted.  You should not assume that if
your Unix password and your MySQL password are the same, that
`PASSWORD()' will result in the same encrypted value as is stored in the
Unix password file. *Note User names::.

Keeping Your Password Secure
----------------------------

It is inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it to
discovery by other users.  The methods you can use to specify your
password when you run client programs are listed below, along with an
assessment of the risks of each method:

   * Never give a normal user access to the `mysql.user' table. Knowing
     the encrypted password for a user makes it possible to login as
     this user.  The passwords are only scrambled so that one shouldn't
     be able to see the real password you used (if you happen to use a
     similar password with your other applications).

   * Use a `-pyour_pass' or `--password=your_pass' option on the command
     line.  This is convenient but insecure, because your password
     becomes visible to system status programs (such as `ps') that may
     be invoked by other users to display command lines.  (MySQL
     clients typically overwrite the command-line argument with zeroes
     during their initialization sequence, but there is still a brief
     interval during which the value is visible.)

   * Use a `-p' or `--password' option (with no `your_pass' value
     specified).  In this case, the client program solicits the
     password from the terminal:

          shell> mysql -u user_name -p
          Enter password: ********

     The `*' characters represent your password.

     It is more secure to enter your password this way than to specify
     it on the command line because it is not visible to other users.
     However, this method of entering a password is suitable only for
     programs that you run interactively.  If you want to invoke a
     client from a script that runs non-interactively, there is no
     opportunity to enter the password from the terminal. On some
     systems, you may even find that the first line of your script is
     read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your password!

   * Store your password in a configuration file.  For example, you can
     list your password in the `[client]' section of the `.my.cnf' file
     in your home directory:

          [client]
          password=your_pass

     If you store your password in `.my.cnf', the file should not be
     group or world readable or writable.  Make sure the file's access
     mode is `400' or `600'.

     *Note Option files::.

   * You can store your password in the `MYSQL_PWD' environment
     variable, but this method must be considered extremely insecure
     and should not be used.  Some versions of `ps' include an option
     to display the environment of running processes; your password
     will be in plain sight for all to see if you set `MYSQL_PWD'.
     Even on systems without such a version of `ps', it is unwise to
     assume there is no other method to observe process environments.
     *Note Environment variables::.

All in all, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt
for the password or to specify the password in a properly protected
`.my.cnf' file.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Backup,  Next: BACKUP TABLE,  Prev: Disaster Prevention,  Up: Disaster Prevention

Database Backups
----------------

Because MySQL tables are stored as files, it is easy to do a backup. To
get a consistent backup, do a `LOCK TABLES' on the relevant tables
followed by `FLUSH TABLES' for the tables.  *Note `LOCK TABLES': LOCK
TABLES.  *Note `FLUSH': FLUSH.  You only need a read lock; this allows
other threads to continue to query the tables while you are making a
copy of the files in the database directory.  The `FLUSH TABLE' is
needed to ensure that the all active index pages is written to disk
before you start the backup.

If you want to make a SQL level backup of a table, you can use `SELECT
INTO OUTFILE' or `BACKUP TABLE'. *Note SELECT::.  *Note BACKUP TABLE::.

Another way to back up a database is to use the `mysqldump' program or
the `mysqlhotcopy script'. *Note `mysqldump': mysqldump.  *Note
`mysqlhotcopy': mysqlhotcopy.

  1. Do a full backup of your databases:

          shell> mysqldump --tab=/path/to/some/dir --opt --full
          
          or
          
          shell> mysqlhotcopy database /path/to/some/dir

     You can also simply copy all table files (`*.frm', `*.MYD', and
     `*.MYI' files) as long as the server isn't updating anything.  The
     script `mysqlhotcopy' does use this method.

  2. Stop `mysqld' if it's running, then start it with the
     `--log-update[=file_name]' option.  *Note Update log::. The update
     log file(s) provide you with the information you need to replicate
     changes to the database that are made subsequent to the point at
     which you executed `mysqldump'.

If you have to restore something, try to recover your tables using
`REPAIR TABLE' or `myisamchk -r' first.  That should work in 99.9% of
all cases.  If `myisamchk' fails, try the following procedure: (This
will only work if you have started MySQL with `--log-update'. *Note
Update log::.):

  1. Restore the original `mysqldump' backup.

  2. Execute the following command to re-run the updates in the binary
     log:

          shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql

     If you are using the update log you can use:

          shell> ls -1 -t -r hostname.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql

`ls' is used to get all the update log files in the right order.

You can also do selective backups with `SELECT * INTO OUTFILE
'file_name' FROM tbl_name' and restore with `LOAD DATA INFILE
'file_name' REPLACE ...' To avoid duplicate records, you need a
`PRIMARY KEY' or a `UNIQUE' key in the table. The `REPLACE' keyword
causes old records to be replaced with new ones when a new record
duplicates an old record on a unique key value.

If you get performance problems in making backups on your system, you
can solve this by setting up replication and do the backups on the slave
instead of on the master. *Note Replication Intro::.

If you are using a Veritas file system, you can do:

  1. Execute in a client (perl ?) `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK'

  2. Fork a shell or execute in another client `mount vxfs snapshot'.

  3. Execute in the first client `UNLOCK TABLES'

  4. Copy files from snapshot

  5. Unmount snapshot

`BACKUP TABLE' Syntax
---------------------

     BACKUP TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...] TO '/path/to/backup/directory'

Make a copy of all the table files to the backup directory that are the
minimum needed to restore it. Currenlty only works for `MyISAM' tables.
For `MyISAM' table, copies `.frm' (definition)  and `.MYD' (data)
files. The index file can be rebuilt from those two.

Before using this command, please see *Note Backup::.

During the backup, read lock will be held for each table, one at time,
as they are being backed up. If you want to backup several tables as a
snapshot, you must first issue `LOCK TABLES' obtaining a read lock for
each table in the group.

The command returns a table with the following columns:

*Column*                  *Value*
Table                     Table name
Op                        Always "backup"
Msg_type                  One of `status', `error', `info' or `warning'.
Msg_text                  The message.

Note that `BACKUP TABLE' is only available in MySQL version 3.23.25 and
later.


File: mysql.info,  Node: RESTORE TABLE,  Next: CHECK TABLE,  Prev: BACKUP TABLE,  Up: Disaster Prevention

`RESTORE TABLE' Syntax
----------------------

     RESTORE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...] FROM '/path/to/backup/directory'

Restores the table(s) from the backup that was made with `BACKUP
TABLE'. Existing tables will not be overwritten - if you try to restore
over an existing table, you will get an error. Restore will take
longer than BACKUP due to the need to rebuilt the index. The more keys
you have, the longer it is going to take. Just as `BACKUP TABLE',
currently only works of `MyISAM' tables.

The command returns a table with the following columns:

*Column*                  *Value*
Table                     Table name
Op                        Always "restore"
Msg_type                  One of `status', `error', `info' or `warning'.
Msg_text                  The message.


File: mysql.info,  Node: CHECK TABLE,  Next: REPAIR TABLE,  Prev: RESTORE TABLE,  Up: Disaster Prevention

`CHECK TABLE' Syntax
--------------------

     CHECK TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...] [option [option...]]
     
     option = QUICK | FAST | MEDIUM | EXTENDED | CHANGED

`CHECK TABLE' only works on `MyISAM' tables. On `MyISAM' tables it's
the same thing as running `myisamchk -m table_name' on the table.

If you don't specify any option `MEDIUM' is used.

Checks the table(s) for errors. For `MyISAM' tables the key statistics
is updated. The command returns a table with the following columns:

*Column*                  *Value*
Table                     Table name.
Op                        Always "check".
Msg_type                  One of `status', `error', `info', or `warning'.
Msg_text                  The message.

Note that you can get many rows of information for each checked table.
The last row will be of `Msg_type status' and should normally be `OK'.
If you don't get `OK', or `Not checked' you should normally run a
repair of the table. *Note Table maintenance::. `Not checked' means
that the table the given `TYPE' told MySQL that there wasn't any need
to check the table.

The different check types stand for the following:

*Type*         *Meaning*
`QUICK'        Don't scan the rows to check for wrong links.
`FAST'         Only check tables which haven't been closed properly.
`CHANGED'      Only check tables which have been changed since last
               check or haven't been closed properly.
`MEDIUM'       Scan rows to verify that deleted links are ok. This also
               calculates a key checksum for the rows and verifies this
               with a calcualted checksum for the keys.
`EXTENDED'     Do a full key lookup for all keys for each row.  This
               ensures that the table is 100 % consistent, but will take
               a long time!

For dynamic sized `MyISAM' tables a started check will always do a
`MEDIUM' check. For static size rows we skip the row scan for `QUICK'
and `FAST' as the rows are very seldom corrupted.

You can combine check options as in:

     CHECK TABLE test_table FAST QUICK;

Which only would do a quick check on the table if it wasn't closed
properly.

*NOTE:* that in some case `CHECK TABLE' will change the table!  This
happens if the table is marked as 'corrupted' or 'not closed properly'
but `CHECK TABLE' didn't find any problems in the table.  In this case
`CHECK TABLE' will mark the table as ok.

If a table is corrupted, then it's most likely that the problem is in
the indexes and not in the data part.  All of the above check types
checks the indexes throughly and should thus find most errors.

If you just want to check a table that you assume is ok, you should use
no check options or the `QUICK' option. The later should be used when
you are in a hurry and can take the very small risk that `QUICK' didn't
find an error in the data file (In most cases MySQL should find, under
normal usage, any error in the data file. If this happens then the
table will be marked as 'corrupted', in which case the table can't be
used until it's repaired).

`FAST' and `CHANGED' are mostly intended to be used from a script (for
example to be executed from cron) if you want to check your table from
time to time. In most cases you `FAST' is to be prefered over
`CHANGED'.  (The only case when it isn't is when you suspect a bug you
have found a bug in the `MyISAM' code.).

`EXTENDED' is only to be used after you have run a normal check but
still get strange errors from a table when MySQL tries to update a row
or find a row by key (this is VERY unlikely to happen if a normal check
has succeeded!).

Some things reported by check table, can't be corrected automatically:

   * `Found row where the auto_increment column has the value 0'.

     This means that you have in the table a row where the
     `auto_increment' index column contains the value 0.  (It's
     possible to create a row where the auto_increment column is 0 by
     explicitely setting the column to 0 with an `UPDATE' statement)

     This isn't an error in itself, but could cause trouble if you
     decide to dump the table and restore it or do an `ALTER TABLE' on
     the table. In this case the auto_increment column will change
     value, according to the rules of auto_increment columns, which
     could cause problems like a duplicate key error.

     To get rid of the warning, just execute an `UPDATE' statement to
     set the column to some other value than 0.


File: mysql.info,  Node: REPAIR TABLE,  Next: Table maintenance,  Prev: CHECK TABLE,  Up: Disaster Prevention

`REPAIR TABLE' Syntax
---------------------

     REPAIR TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...] [QUICK] [EXTENDED]

`REPAIR TABLE' only works on `MyISAM' tables and is the same as running
`myisamchk -r table_name' on the table.

Normally you should never have to run this command, but if disaster
strikes you are very likely to get back all your data from a MyISAM
table with `REPAIR TABLE'. If your tables get corrupted a lot you should
try to find the reason for this! *Note Crashing::. *Note MyISAM table
problems::.

`REPAIR TABLE' repairs a possible corrupted table. The command returns a
table with the following columns:

*Column*                  *Value*
Table                     Table name
Op                        Always "repair"
Msg_type                  One of `status', `error', `info' or `warning'.
Msg_text                  The message.

Note that you can get many rows of information for each repaired table.
The last one row will be of `Msg_type status' and should normally be
`OK'.  If you don't get `OK', you should try repairing the table with
`myisamchk -o', as `REPAIR TABLE' does not yet implement all the
options of `myisamchk'. In the near future, we will make it more
flexible.

If `QUICK' is given then MySQL will try to do a `REPAIR' of only the
index tree.

If you use `EXTENDED' then MySQL will create the index row by row
instead of creating one index at a time with sorting;  This may be
better than sorting on fixed-length keys if you have long `char()' keys
that compress very good.

Using `myisamchk' for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery
----------------------------------------------------------

Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM tables with
the `CHECK TABLE' command. *Note CHECK TABLE::.  You can repair tables
with the `REPAIR TABLE' command. *Note REPAIR TABLE::.

To check/repair MyISAM tables (`.MYI' and `.MYD') you should use the
`myisamchk' utility. To check/repair ISAM tables (`.ISM' and `.ISD')
you should use the `isamchk' utility. *Note Table types::.

In the following text we will talk about `myisamchk', but everything
also applies to the old `isamchk'.

You can use the `myisamchk' utility to get information about your
database tables, check and repair them, or optimize them.  The following
sections describe how to invoke `myisamchk' (including a description of
its options), how to set up a table maintenance schedule, and how to
use `myisamchk' to perform its various functions.

You can, in most cases, also use the command `OPTIMIZE TABLES' to
optimize and repair tables, but this is not as fast or reliable (in case
of real fatal errors) as `myisamchk'.  On the other hand, `OPTIMIZE
TABLE' is easier to use and you don't have to worry about flushing
tables.  *Note `OPTIMIZE TABLE': OPTIMIZE TABLE.

Even that the repair in `myisamchk' is quite secure, it's always a good
idea to make a backup BEFORE doing a repair (or anything that could
make a lot of changes to a table)

`myisamchk' Invocation Syntax
.............................

`myisamchk' is invoked like this:

     shell> myisamchk [options] tbl_name

The `options' specify what you want `myisamchk' to do.  They are
described below.  (You can also get a list of options by invoking
`myisamchk --help'.)  With no options, `myisamchk' simply checks your
table.  To get more information or to tell `myisamchk' to take
corrective action, specify options as described below and in the
following sections.

`tbl_name' is the database table you want to check/repair.  If you run
`myisamchk' somewhere other than in the database directory, you must
specify the path to the file, because `myisamchk' has no idea where your
database is located.  Actually, `myisamchk' doesn't care whether or not
the files you are working on are located in a database directory; you
can copy the files that correspond to a database table into another
location and perform recovery operations on them there.

You can name several tables on the `myisamchk' command line if you
wish.  You can also specify a name as an index file name (with the
`.MYI' suffix), which allows you to specify all tables in a directory
by using the pattern `*.MYI'.  For example, if you are in a database
directory, you can check all the tables in the directory like this:

     shell> myisamchk *.MYI

If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables
there by specifying the path to the directory:

     shell> myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI

You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wild card
with the path to the MySQL data directory:

     shell> myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI

The recommended way to quickly check all tables is:

     myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
     isamchk --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM

If you want to check all tables and repair all tables that are
corrupted, you can use the following line:

     myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
     isamchk --silent --force -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM

The above assumes that you have more than 64 M free.

Note that if you get an error like:

     myisamchk: warning: 1 clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly

This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by
the another program (like the `mysqld' server) that hasn't yet closed
the file or that has died without closing the file properly.

If you `mysqld' is running, you must force a sync/close of all tables
with `FLUSH TABLES' and ensure that no one is using the tables while
you are running `myisamchk'.  In MySQL Version 3.23 the easiest way to
avoid this problem is to use `CHECK TABLE' instead of `myisamchk' to
check tables.

General Options for `myisamchk'
...............................

`myisamchk' supports the following options.

`-# or --debug=debug_options'
     Output debug log. The `debug_options' string often is
     `'d:t:o,filename''.

`-? or --help'
     Display a help message and exit.

`-O var=option, --set-variable var=option'
     Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables and their
     default values for myisamchk can be examined with `myisamchk
     --help':
     key_buffer_size      523264
     read_buffer_size     262136
     write_buffer_size    262136
     sort_buffer_size     2097144
     sort_key_blocks      16
     decode_bits          9

     `sort_buffer_size' is used when the keys are repaired by sorting
     keys, which is the normal case when you use `--recover'.

     `key_buffer_size' is used when you are checking the table with
     `--extended-check' or when the keys are repaired by inserting key
     row by row in to the table (like when doing normal inserts).
     Repairing through the key buffer is used in the following cases:

        * If you use `--safe-recover'.

        * If you are using a `FULLTEXT' index.

        * If the temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more
          than twice as big as when creating the key file directly.
          This is often the case when you have big `CHAR', `VARCHAR' or
          `TEXT' keys as the sort needs to store the whole keys during
          sorting. If you have lots of temporary space and you can
          force `myisamchk' to repair by sorting you can use the
          `--sort-recover' option.

     Reparing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than
     using sorting, but is also much slower.

     If you want a faster repair, set the above variables to about 1/4
     of your available memory.  You can set both variables to big
     values, as only one of the above buffers will be used at a time.

`-s or --silent'
     Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur. You can use `-s'
     twice (`-ss') to make `myisamchk' very silent.

`-v or --verbose'
     Verbose mode.  Print more information. This can be used with `-d'
     and `-e'. Use `-v' multiple times (`-vv', `-vvv') for more
     verbosity!

`-V or --version'
     Print the `myisamchk' version and exit.

`-w or, --wait'
     Instead of giving an error if the table is locked, wait until the
     table is unlocked before continuing.  Note that if you are running
     `mysqld' on the table with `--skip-locking', the table can only be
     locked by another `myisamchk' command.

Check Options for `myisamchk'
.............................

`-c or --check'
     Check table for errors. This is the default operation if you are
     not giving `myisamchk' any options that override this.

`-e or --extend-check'
     Check the table VERY thoroughly (which is quite slow if you have
     many indexes).  This option should only be used in extreme cases.
     Normally, `myisamchk' or `myisamchk --medium-check' should, in most
     cases, be able to find out if there are any errors in the table.

     If you are using `--extended-check' and have much memory, you
     should increase the value of `key_buffer_size' a lot!

`-F or --fast'
     Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.

`-C or --check-only-changed'
     Check only tables that have changed since the last check.

`-f or --force'
     Restart `myisamchk' with `-r' (repair) on the table, if
     `myisamchk' finds any errors in the table.

`-i or --information'
     Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.

`-m or --medium-check'
     Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99% of all errors.
     Should, however, be good enough for most cases.

`-U or --update-state'
     Store in the `.MYI' file when the table was checked and if the
     table crashed.  This should be used to get full benefit of the
     `--check-only-changed' option, but you shouldn't use this option
     if the `mysqld' server is using the table and you are running
     `mysqld' with `--skip-locking'.

`-T or --read-only'
     Don't mark table as checked. This is useful if you use `myisamchk'
     to check a table that is in use by some other application that
     doesn't use locking (like `mysqld --skip-locking').

Repair Options for myisamchk
............................

The following options are used if you start `myisamchk' with `-r' or
`-o':

`-D # or --data-file-length=#'
     Max length of data file (when re-creating data file when it's
     'full').

`-e or --extend-check'
     Try to recover every possible row from the data file.  Normally
     this will also find a lot of garbage rows. Don't use this option
     if you are not totally desperate.

`-f or --force'
     Overwrite old temporary files (`table_name.TMD') instead of
     aborting.

`-k # or keys-used=#'
     If you are using ISAM, tells the ISAM table handler to update only
     the first `#' indexes.  If you are using `MyISAM', tells which keys
     to use, where each binary bit stands for one key (first key is bit
     0).  This can be used to get faster inserts!  Deactivated indexes
     can be reactivated by using `myisamchk -r'.  keys.

`-l or --no-symlinks'
     Do not follow symbolic links. Normally `myisamchk' repairs the
     table a symlink points at.  This option doesn't exist in MySQL 4.0,
     as MySQL 4.0 will not remove symlinks during repair.

`-r or --recover'
     Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique
     (which is an extremely unlikely error with ISAM/MyISAM tables).
     If you want to recover a table, this is the option to try first.
     Only if myisamchk reports that the table can't be recovered by
     `-r', you should then try `-o'.  (Note that in the unlikely case
     that `-r' fails, the data file is still intact.)  If you have lots
     of memory, you should increase the size of `sort_buffer_size'!

`-o or --safe-recover'
     Uses an old recovery method (reads through all rows in order and
     updates all index trees based on the found rows); this is a
     magnitude slower than `-r', but can handle a couple of very
     unlikely cases that `-r' cannot handle.  This recovery method also
     uses much less disk space than `-r'. Normally one should always
     first repair with `-r', and only if this fails use `-o'.

     If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
     `key_buffer_size'!

`-n or --sort-recover'
     Force `myisamchk' to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the
     temporary files should be very big.  This will not have any effect
     if you have fulltext keys in the table.

`--character-sets-dir=...'
     Directory where character sets are stored.

`--set-character-set=name'
     Change the character set used by the index

`.t or --tmpdir=path'
     Path for storing temporary files. If this is not set, `myisamchk'
     will use the environment variable `TMPDIR' for this.

`-q or --quick'
     Faster repair by not modifying the data file. One can give a second
     `-q' to force `myisamchk' to modify the original datafile in case
     of duplicate keys

`-u or --unpack'
     Unpack file packed with myisampack.

Other Options for `myisamchk'
.............................

Other actions that `myisamchk' can do, besides repair and check tables:

`-a or --analyze'
     Analyze the distribution of keys. This improves join performance by
     enabling the join optimizer to better choose in which order it
     should join the tables and which keys it should use: `myisamchk
     --describe --verbose table_name'' or using `SHOW KEYS' in MySQL.

`-d or --description'
     Prints some information about table.

`-A or --set-auto-increment[=value]'
     Force auto_increment to start at this or higher value. If no value
     is given, then sets the next auto_increment value to the highest
     used value for the auto key + 1.

`-S or --sort-index'
     Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order.  This will optimize
     seeks and will make table scanning by key faster.

`-R or --sort-records=#'
     Sorts records according to an index.  This makes your data much
     more localized and may speed up ranged `SELECT' and `ORDER BY'
     operations on this index. (It may be VERY slow to do a sort the
     first time!)  To find out a table's index numbers, use `SHOW
     INDEX', which shows a table's indexes in the same order that
     `myisamchk' sees them.  Indexes are numbered beginning with 1.

`myisamchk' Memory Usage
........................

Memory allocation is important when you run `myisamchk'.  `myisamchk'
uses no more memory than you specify with the `-O' options.  If you are
going to use `myisamchk' on very large files, you should first decide
how much memory you want it to use.  The default is to use only about
3M to fix things.  By using larger values, you can get `myisamchk' to
operate faster.  For example, if you have more than 32M RAM, you could
use options such as these (in addition to any other options you might
specify):

     shell> myisamchk -O sort=16M -O key=16M -O read=1M -O write=1M ...

Using `-O sort=16M' should probably be enough for most cases.

Be aware that `myisamchk' uses temporary files in `TMPDIR'. If `TMPDIR'
points to a memory file system, you may easily get out of memory
errors. If this happens, set `TMPDIR' to point at some directory with
more space and restart `myisamchk'.

When repairing, `myisamchk' will also need a lot of disk space:

   * Double the size of the record file (the original one and a copy).
     This space is not needed if one does a repair with `--quick', as
     in this case only the index file will be re-created.  This space
     is needed on the same disk as the original record file!

   * Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old
     index file is truncated at start, so one usually ignore this space.
     This space is needed on the same disk as the original index file!

   * When using `--recover' or `--sort-recover' (but not when using
     `--safe-recover', you will need space for a sort buffer for:
     `(largest_key + row_pointer_length)*number_of_rows * 2'.  You can
     check the length of the keys and the row_pointer_length with
     `myisamchk -dv table'.  This space is allocated on the temporary
     disk (specified by `TMPDIR' or `--tmpdir=#').

If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try to use
`--safe-recover' instead of `--recover'.

Using `myisamchk' for Crash Recovery
....................................

If you run `mysqld' with `--skip-locking' (which is the default on some
systems, like Linux), you can't reliably use `myisamchk' to check a
table when `mysqld' is using the same table.  If you can be sure that
no one is accessing the tables through `mysqld' while you run
`myisamchk', you only have to do `mysqladmin flush-tables' before you
start checking the tables.  If you can't guarantee the above, then you
must take down `mysqld' while you check the tables.  If you run
`myisamchk' while `mysqld' is updating the tables, you may get a
warning that a table is corrupt even if it isn't.

If you are not using `--skip-locking', you can use `myisamchk' to check
tables at any time.  While you do this, all clients that try to update
the table will wait until `myisamchk' is ready before continuing.

If you use `myisamchk' to repair or optimize tables, you *MUST* always
ensure that the `mysqld' server is not using the table (this also
applies if you are using `--skip-locking').  If you don't take down
`mysqld' you should at least do a `mysqladmin flush-tables' before you
run `myisamchk'.

This chapter describes how to check for and deal with data corruption
in MySQL databases.  If your tables get corrupted a lot you should try
to find the reason for this! *Note Crashing::.

The `MyISAM' table section contains reason for why a table could be
corrupted. *Note MyISAM table problems::.

When performing crash recovery, it is important to understand that each
table `tbl_name' in a database corresponds to three files in the
database directory:

*File*         *Purpose*
`tbl_name.frm' Table definition (form) file
`tbl_name.MYD' Data file
`tbl_name.MYI' Index file

Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various
ways, but problems occur most often in data files and index files.

`myisamchk' works by creating a copy of the `.MYD' (data) file row by
row. It ends the repair stage by removing the old `.MYD' file and
renaming the new file to the original file name.  If you use `--quick',
`myisamchk' does not create a temporary `.MYD' file, but instead
assumes that the `.MYD' file is correct and only generates a new index
file without touching the `.MYD' file. This is safe, because
`myisamchk' automatically detects if the `.MYD' file is corrupt and
aborts the repair in this case.  You can also give two `--quick'
options to `myisamchk'.  In this case, `myisamchk' does not abort on
some errors (like duplicate key) but instead tries to resolve them by
modifying the `.MYD' file. Normally the use of two `--quick' options is
useful only if you have too little free disk space to perform a normal
repair.  In this case you should at least make a backup before running
`myisamchk'.

How to Check Tables for Errors
..............................

To check a MyISAM table, use the following commands:

`myisamchk tbl_name'
     This finds 99.99% of all errors. What it can't find is corruption
     that involves *ONLY* the data file (which is very unusual). If you
     want to check a table, you should normally run `myisamchk' without
     options or with either the `-s' or `--silent' option.

`myisamchk -m tbl_name'
     This finds 99.999% of all errors. It checks first all index
     entries for errors and then it reads through all rows. It
     calculates a checksum for all keys in the rows and verifies that
     they checksum matches the checksum for the keys in the index tree.

`myisamchk -e tbl_name'
     This does a complete and thorough check of all data (`-e' means
     "extended check"). It does a check-read of every key for each row
     to verify that they indeed point to the correct row.  This may
     take a LONG time on a big table with many keys.  `myisamchk' will
     normally stop after the first error it finds. If you want to
     obtain more information, you can add the `--verbose' (`-v')
     option.  This causes `myisamchk' to keep going, up through a
     maximum of 20 errors.  In normal usage, a simple `myisamchk' (with
     no arguments other than the table name) is sufficient.

`myisamchk -e -i tbl_name'
     Like the previous command, but the `-i' option tells `myisamchk' to
     print some informational statistics, too.

How to Repair Tables
....................

In the following section we only talk about using `myisamchk' on
`MyISAM' tables (extensions `.MYI' and `.MYD').  If you are using
`ISAM' tables (extensions `.ISM' and `.ISD'), you should use `isamchk'
instead.

Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.14, you can repair MyISAM tables with
the `REPAIR TABLE' command. *Note REPAIR TABLE::.

The symptoms of a corrupted table include queries that abort
unexpectedly and observable errors such as these:

   * `tbl_name.frm' is locked against change

   * Can't find file `tbl_name.MYI' (Errcode: ###)

   * Unexpected end of file

   * Record file is crashed

   * Got error ### from table handler

     To get more information about the error you can run `perror ###'.
     Here is the most common errors that indicates a problem with the
     table:

          shell> perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
          126 = Index file is crashed / Wrong file format
          127 = Record-file is crashed
          132 = Old database file
          134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
          135 = No more room in record file
          136 = No more room in index file
          141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
          144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
          145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired

     Note that error 135, no more room in record file, is not an error
     that can be fixed by a simple repair. In this case you have to do:

          ALTER TABLE table MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;


In the other cases, you must repair your tables. `myisamchk' can
usually detect and fix most things that go wrong.

The repair process involves up to four stages, described below. Before
you begin, you should `cd' to the database directory and check the
permissions of the table files. Make sure they are readable by the Unix
user that `mysqld' runs as (and to you, because you need to access the
files you are checking).  If it turns out you need to modify files,
they must also be writable by you.

If you are using MySQL Version 3.23.16 and above, you can (and should)
use the `CHECK' and `REPAIR' commands to check and repair `MyISAM'
tables.  *Note CHECK TABLE::.  *Note REPAIR TABLE::.

The manual section about table maintenance includes the options to
`isamchk'/`myisamchk'.  *Note Table maintenance::.

The following section is for the cases where the above command fails or
if you want to use the extended features that `isamchk'/`myisamchk'
provides.

If you are going to repair a table from the command line, you must first
take down the `mysqld' server. Note that when you do `mysqladmin
shutdown' on a remote server, the `mysqld' server will still be alive
for a while after `mysqladmin' returns, until all queries are stopped
and all keys have been flushed to disk.

*Stage 1: Checking your tables*

Run `myisamchk *.MYI' or `myisamchk -e *.MYI' if you have more time.
Use the `-s' (silent) option to suppress unnecessary information.

If the `mysqld' server is done you should use the -update option to tell
`myisamchk' to mark the table as 'checked'.

You have to repair only those tables for which `myisamchk' announces an
error.  For such tables, proceed to Stage 2.

If you get weird errors when checking (such as `out of memory' errors),
or if `myisamchk' crashes, go to Stage 3.

*Stage 2: Easy safe repair*

NOTE: If you want repairing to go much faster, you should add: `-O
sort_buffer=# -O key_buffer=#' (where # is about 1/4 of the available
memory) to all `isamchk/myisamchk' commands.

First, try `myisamchk -r -q tbl_name' (`-r -q' means "quick recovery
mode"). This will attempt to repair the index file without touching the
data file.  If the data file contains everything that it should and the
delete links point at the correct locations within the data file, this
should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing the next table.
Otherwise, use the following procedure:

  1. Make a backup of the data file before continuing.

  2. Use `myisamchk -r tbl_name' (`-r' means "recovery mode"). This will
     remove incorrect records and deleted records from the data file and
     reconstruct the index file.

  3. If the preceding step fails, use `myisamchk --safe-recover
     tbl_name'.  Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that
     handles a few cases that regular recovery mode doesn't (but is
     slower).

If you get weird errors when repairing (such as `out of memory'
errors), or if `myisamchk' crashes, go to Stage 3.

*Stage 3: Difficult repair*

You should only reach this stage if the first 16K block in the index
file is destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if the index
file is missing.  In this case, it's necessary to create a new index
file. Do so as follows:

  1. Move the data file to some safe place.

  2. Use the table description file to create new (empty) data and
     index files:

          shell> mysql db_name
          mysql> SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;
          mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
          mysql> quit

     If your SQL version doesn't have `TRUNCATE TABLE', use `DELETE FROM
     table_name' instead.

  3. Copy the old data file back onto the newly created data file.
     (Don't just move the old file back onto the new file; you want to
     retain a copy in case something goes wrong.)

Go back to Stage 2.  `myisamchk -r -q' should work now.  (This shouldn't
be an endless loop.)

*Stage 4: Very difficult repair*

You should reach this stage only if the description file has also
crashed. That should never happen, because the description file isn't
changed after the table is created:

  1. Restore the description file from a backup and go back to Stage 3.
     You can also restore the index file and go back to Stage 2.  In
     the latter case, you should start with `myisamchk -r'.

  2. If you don't have a backup but know exactly how the table was
     created, create a copy of the table in another database.  Remove
     the new data file, then move the description and index files from
     the other database to your crashed database.  This gives you new
     description and index files, but leaves the data file alone.  Go
     back to Stage 2 and attempt to reconstruct the index file.

Table Optimization
..................

To coalesce fragmented records and eliminate wasted space resulting from
deleting or updating records, run `myisamchk' in recovery mode:

     shell> myisamchk -r tbl_name

You can optimize a table in the same way using the SQL `OPTIMIZE TABLE'
statement.  `OPTIMIZE TABLE' does a repair of the table, a key analyzes
and also sorts the index tree to give faster key lookups.  There is
also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility and the
server, because the server does all the work when you use `OPTIMIZE
TABLE'. *Note OPTIMIZE TABLE::.

`myisamchk' also has a number of other options you can use to improve
the performance of a table:

`-S, --sort-index'

`-R index_num, --sort-records=index_num'

`-a, --analyze'
For a full description of the option. *Note myisamchk syntax::.

Setting Up a Table Maintenance Regimen
--------------------------------------

Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM tables with
the `CHECK TABLE' command. *Note CHECK TABLE::.  You can repair tables
with the `REPAIR TABLE' command. *Note REPAIR TABLE::.

It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than
waiting for problems to occur.  For maintenance purposes, you can use
`myisamchk -s' to check tables.  The `-s' option (short for `--silent')
causes `myisamchk' to run in silent mode, printing messages only when
errors occur.

It's also a good idea to check tables when the server starts up.  For
example, whenever the machine has done a reboot in the middle of an
update, you usually need to check all the tables that could have been
affected. (This is an "expected crashed table".) You could add a test to
`safe_mysqld' that runs `myisamchk' to check all tables that have been
modified during the last 24 hours if there is an old `.pid' (process
ID) file left after a reboot.  (The `.pid' file is created by `mysqld'
when it starts up and removed when it terminates normally.  The
presence of a `.pid' file at system startup time indicates that
`mysqld' terminated abnormally.)

An even better test would be to check any table whose last-modified time
is more recent than that of the `.pid' file.

You should also check your tables regularly during normal system
operation.  At MySQL AB, we run a `cron' job to check all our important
tables once a week, using a line like this in a `crontab' file:

     35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI

This prints out information about crashed tables so we can examine and
repair them when needed.

As we haven't had any unexpectedly crashed tables (tables that become
corrupted for reasons other than hardware trouble) for a couple of
years now (this is really true), once a week is more than enough for us.

We recommend that to start with, you execute `myisamchk -s' each night
on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours, until
you come to trust MySQL as much as we do.

Normally you don't need to maintain MySQL tables that much.  If you are
changing tables with dynamic size rows (tables with `VARCHAR', `BLOB'
or `TEXT' columns) or have tables with many deleted rows you may want
to from time to time (once a month?) defragment/reclaim space from the
tables.

You can do this by using `OPTIMIZE TABLE' on the tables in question or
if you can take the `mysqld' server down for a while do:

     isamchk -r --silent --sort-index -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.ISM
     myisamchk -r --silent --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI

Getting Information About a Table
---------------------------------

To get a description of a table or statistics about it, use the
commands shown below. We explain some of the information in more detail
later:

`myisamchk -d tbl_name'
     Runs `myisamchk' in "describe mode" to produce a description of
     your table. If you start the MySQL server using the
     `--skip-locking' option, `myisamchk' may report an error for a
     table that is updated while it runs.  However, because `myisamchk'
     doesn't change the table in describe mode, there isn't any risk of
     destroying data.

`myisamchk -d -v tbl_name'
     To produce more information about what `myisamchk' is doing, add
     `-v' to tell it to run in verbose mode.

`myisamchk -eis tbl_name'
     Shows only the most important information from a table. It is slow
     because it must read the whole table.

`myisamchk -eiv tbl_name'
     This is like `-eis', but tells you what is being done.

Example of `myisamchk -d' output:
     MyISAM file:     company.MYI
     Record format:   Fixed length
     Data records:    1403698  Deleted blocks:         0
     Recordlength:    226
     
     table description:
     Key Start Len Index   Type
     1   2     8   unique  double
     2   15    10  multip. text packed stripped
     3   219   8   multip. double
     4   63    10  multip. text packed stripped
     5   167   2   multip. unsigned short
     6   177   4   multip. unsigned long
     7   155   4   multip. text

     9   177   4   multip. unsigned long
         193   1           text

Example of `myisamchk -d -v' output:
     MyISAM file:         company

Here are the sizes of the data and index files for the table used in the
preceding examples:

     -rw-rw-r--   1 monty    tcx     317235748 Jan 12 17:30 company.MYD
     -rw-rw-r--   1 davida   tcx      96482304 Jan 12 18:35 company.MYM

Explanations for the types of information `myisamchk' produces are
given below.  The "keyfile" is the index file.  "Record" and "row" are
synonymous:

`ISAM file'
     Name of the ISAM (index) file.

`Isam-version'
     Version of ISAM format. Currently always 2.

`Creation time'
     When the data file was created.

`Recover time'
     When the index/data file was last reconstructed.

`Data records'
     How many records are in the table.

`Deleted blocks'
     How many deleted blocks still have reserved space.  You can
     optimize your table to minimize this space.  *Note Optimization::.

`Datafile: Parts'
     For dynamic record format, this indicates how many data blocks
     there are. For an optimized table without fragmented records, this
     is the same as `Data records'.

`Deleted data'
     How many bytes of non-reclaimed deleted data there are.  You can
     optimize your table to minimize this space.  *Note Optimization::.

`Datafile pointer'
     The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3,
     4, or 5 bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this cannot be
     controlled from MySQL yet. For fixed tables, this is a record
     address. For dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

`Keyfile pointer'
     The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2,
     or 3 bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this is calculated
     automatically by MySQL. It is always a block address.

`Max datafile length'
     How long the table's data file (`.MYD' file) can become, in bytes.

`Max keyfile length'
     How long the table's key file (`.MYI' file) can become, in bytes.

`Recordlength'
     How much space each record takes, in bytes.

`Record format'
     The format used to store table rows.  The examples shown above use
     `Fixed length'.  Other possible values are `Compressed' and
     `Packed'.

`table description'
     A list of all keys in the table. For each key, some low-level
     information is presented:

    `Key'
          This key's number.

    `Start'
          Where in the record this index part starts.

    `Len'
          How long this index part is. For packed numbers, this should
          always be the full length of the column. For strings, it may
          be shorter than the full length of the indexed column,
          because you can index a prefix of a string column.

    `Index'
          `unique' or `multip.' (multiple). Indicates whether or not
          one value can exist multiple times in this index.

    `Type'
          What data-type this index part has. This is an ISAM data-type
          with the options `packed', `stripped' or `empty'.

    `Root'
          Address of the root index block.

    `Blocksize'
          The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but
          the value may be changed at compile time.

    `Rec/key'
          This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells
          how many records there are per value for this key. A unique
          key always has a value of 1. This may be updated after a
          table is loaded (or greatly changed) with `myisamchk -a'. If
          this is not updated at all, a default value of 30 is given.

`'
     In the first example above, the 9th key is a multi-part key with
     two parts.

`Keyblocks used'
     What percentage of the keyblocks are used. Because the table used
     in the examples had just been reorganized with `myisamchk', the
     values are very high (very near the theoretical maximum).

`Packed'
     MySQL tries to pack keys with a common suffix. This can only be
     used for `CHAR'/`VARCHAR'/`DECIMAL' keys. For long strings like
     names, this can significantly reduce the space used. In the third
     example above, the 4th key is 10 characters long and a 60%
     reduction in space is achieved.

`Max levels'
     How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long keys
     get high values.

`Records'
     How many rows are in the table.

`M.recordlength'
     The average record length. For tables with fixed-length records,
     this is the exact record length.

`Packed'
     MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The `Packed' value
     indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.

`Recordspace used'
     What percentage of the data file is used.

`Empty space'
     What percentage of the data file is unused.

`Blocks/Record'
     Average number of blocks per record (that is, how many links a
     fragmented record is composed of). This is always 1 for
     fixed-format tables. This value should stay as close to 1.0 as
     possible. If it gets too big, you can reorganize the table with
     `myisamchk'.  *Note Optimization::.

`Recordblocks'
     How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed format, this is the
     same as the number of records.

`Deleteblocks'
     How many blocks (links) are deleted.

`Recorddata'
     How many bytes in the data file are used.

`Deleted data'
     How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused).

`Lost space'
     If a record is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost.
     This is the sum of all such losses, in bytes.

`Linkdata'
     When the dynamic table format is used, record fragments are linked
     with pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). `Linkdata' is the sum of the
     amount of storage used by all such pointers.

If a table has been compressed with `myisampack', `myisamchk -d' prints
additional information about each table column.  See *Note
`myisampack': myisampack, for an example of this information and a
description of what it means.

`OPTIMIZE TABLE' Syntax
-----------------------

     OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name]...

`OPTIMIZE TABLE' should be used if you have deleted a large part of a
table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length
rows (tables that have `VARCHAR', `BLOB', or `TEXT' columns).  Deleted
records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent `INSERT'
operations reuse old record positions. You can use `OPTIMIZE TABLE' to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the data file.

For the moment `OPTIMIZE TABLE' only works on *MyISAM* and `BDB'
tables. For `BDB' tables, `OPTIMIZE TABLE' is currently mapped to
`ANALYZE TABLE'. *Note ANALYZE TABLE::.

You can get optimize table to work on other table types by starting
`mysqld' with `--skip-new' or `--safe-mode', but in this case `OPTIMIZE
TABLE' is just mapped to `ALTER TABLE'.

`OPTIMIZE TABLE' works the following way:
   * If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.

   * If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.

   * If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be
     done by sorting the index), update them.

`OPTIMIZE TABLE' for `MyISAM' tables is equvialent of running
`myisamchk --quick --check-changed-tables --sort-index --analyze' on
the table.

Note that the table is locked during the time `OPTIMIZE TABLE' is
running!


File: mysql.info,  Node: ANALYZE TABLE,  Next: FLUSH,  Prev: OPTIMIZE TABLE,  Up: Database Administration

`ANALYZE TABLE' Syntax
----------------------

     ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...]

Analyze and store the key distribution for the table.  During the
analyze the table is locked with a read lock.  This works on `MyISAM'
and `BDB' tables.

This is equivalent to running `myisamchk -a' on the table.

MySQL uses the stored key distribution to decide in which order tables
should be joined when one does a join on something else than a constant.

The command returns a table with the following columns:

*Column*                  *Value*
Table                     Table name
Op                        Always "analyze"
Msg_type                  One of `status', `error', `info' or `warning'.
Msg_text                  The message.

You can check the stored key distribution with the `SHOW INDEX' command.
*Note SHOW DATABASE INFO::.

If the table hasn't changed since the last `ANALYZE TABLE' command, the
table will not be analyzed again.


File: mysql.info,  Node: FLUSH,  Next: KILL,  Prev: ANALYZE TABLE,  Up: Database Administration

`FLUSH' Syntax
--------------

     FLUSH flush_option [,flush_option]

You should use the `FLUSH' command if you want to clear some of the
internal caches MySQL uses.  To execute `FLUSH', you must have the
*RELOAD* privilege.

`flush_option' can be any of the following:

`HOSTS'     Empties the host cache tables.  You should flush the host
            tables if some of your hosts change IP number or if you get
            the error message `Host ... is blocked'.  When more than
            `max_connect_errors' errors occur in a row for a given host
            while connection to the MySQL server, MySQL assumes
            something is wrong and blocks the host from further
            connection requests.  Flushing the host tables allows the
            host to attempt to connect again. *Note Blocked host::.) You
            can start `mysqld' with `-O max_connection_errors=999999999'
            to avoid this error message.
`LOGS'      Closes and reopens all log files.  If you have specified the
            update log file or a binary log file without an extension,
            the extension number of the log file will be incremented by
            one relative to the previous file.  If you have used an
            extension in the file name, MySQL will close and reopen the
            update log file.  *Note Update log::. This is the same thing
            as sending the `SIGHUP' signal to the `mysqld' server.
`PRIVILEGES'Reloads the privileges from the grant tables in the `mysql'
            database.
`TABLES'    Closes all open tables and force all tables in use to be
            closed.
`[TABLE |   Flushes only the given tables.
TABLES]     
table_name  
[,table_name...]'
`TABLES     Closes all open tables and locks all tables for all
WITH READ   databases with a read until one executes `UNLOCK TABLES'.
LOCK'       This is very convenient way to get backups if you have a
            file system, like Veritas,that can take snapshots in time.
`STATUS'    Resets most status variables to zero. This is something one
            should only use when debugging a query.

You can also access each of the commands shown above with the
`mysqladmin' utility, using the `flush-hosts', `flush-logs', `reload',
or `flush-tables' commands.

Take also a look at the `RESET' command used with replication. *Note
Replication SQL::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: KILL,  Next: SHOW,  Prev: FLUSH,  Up: Database Administration

`KILL' Syntax
-------------

     KILL thread_id

Each connection to `mysqld' runs in a separate thread.  You can see
which threads are running with the `SHOW PROCESSLIST' command and kill
a thread with the `KILL thread_id' command.

If you have the *process* privilege, you can see and kill all threads.
Otherwise, you can see and kill only your own threads.

You can also use the `mysqladmin processlist' and `mysqladmin kill'
commands to examine and kill threads.

When you do a `KILL', a thread specific `kill flag' is set for the
thread.

In most cases it may take some time for the thread to die as the kill
flag is only checked at specific intervals.

   * In `SELECT', `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' loops, the flag is checked
     after reading a block of rows. If the kill flag is set the
     statement is aborted

   * When doing an `ALTER TABLE' the kill flag is checked before each
     block of rows are read from the original table. If the kill flag
     was set the command is aborted and the temporary table is deleted.

   * When doing an `UPDATE TABLE' and `DELETE TABLE', the kill flag is
     checked after each block read and after each updated or delete
     row. If the kill flag is set the statement is aborted.  Note that
     if you are not using transactions, the changes will not be rolled
     back!

   * `GET_LOCK()' will abort with `NULL'.

   * An `INSERT DELAYED' thread will quickly flush all rows it has in
     memory and die.

   * If the thread is in the table lock handler (state: `Locked'), the
     table lock will be quickly aborted.

   * If the thread is waiting for free disk space in a `write' call, the
     write is aborted with an disk full error message.

* Menu:

* SHOW::                        `SHOW' Syntax


File: mysql.info,  Node: SHOW,  Prev: KILL,  Up: Database Administration

`SHOW' Syntax
-------------

        SHOW DATABASES [LIKE wild]
     or SHOW [OPEN] TABLES [FROM db_name] [LIKE wild]
     or SHOW [FULL] COLUMNS FROM tbl_name [FROM db_name] [LIKE wild]

     or SHOW GRANTS FOR user
     or SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name
     or SHOW MASTER STATUS
     or SHOW MASTER LOGS

`SHOW' provides information about databases, tables, columns, or status
information about the server. If the `LIKE wild' part is used, the
`wild' string can be a string that uses the SQL `%' and `_' wild-card
characters.

Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes
...................................................................

You can use `db_name.tbl_name' as an alternative to the `tbl_name FROM
db_name' syntax.  These two statements are equivalent:

     mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM mytable FROM mydb;
     mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM mydb.mytable;

`SHOW DATABASES' lists the databases on the MySQL server host.  You can
also get this list using the `mysqlshow' command.

`SHOW TABLES' lists the tables in a given database.  You can also get
this list using the `mysqlshow db_name' command.

*NOTE:* If a user doesn't have any privileges for a table, the table
will not show up in the output from `SHOW TABLES' or `mysqlshow
db_name'.

`SHOW OPEN TABLES' lists the tables that are currently open in the
table cache. *Note Table cache::.  The `Comment' field tells how many
times the table is `cached' and `in_use'.

`SHOW COLUMNS' lists the columns in a given table.  If you specify the
`FULL' option, you will also get the privileges you have for each
column.  If the column types are different than you expect them to be
based on a `CREATE TABLE' statement, note that MySQL sometimes changes
column types.  *Note Silent column changes::.

The `DESCRIBE' statement provides information similar to `SHOW COLUMNS'.
*Note `DESCRIBE': DESCRIBE.

`SHOW FIELDS' is a synonym for `SHOW COLUMNS', and `SHOW KEYS' is a
synonym for `SHOW INDEX'.  You can also list a table's columns or
indexes with `mysqlshow db_name tbl_name' or `mysqlshow -k db_name
tbl_name'.

`SHOW INDEX' returns the index information in a format that closely
resembles the `SQLStatistics' call in ODBC. The following columns are
returned:

*Column*                  *Meaning*
`Table'                   Name of the table.
`Non_unique'              0 if the index can't contain duplicates.
`Key_name'                Name of the index.
`Seq_in_index'            Column sequence number in index,
                                                 starting with 1.
`Column_name'             Column name.
`Collation'               How the column is sorted in the index.
                                                        In MySQL, this
                          can have values
                                `A' (Ascending) or `NULL' (Not
                                                      sorted).
`Cardinality'             Number of unique values in the index.
                                                       This is updated
                          by running
                           `isamchk -a'.
`Sub_part'                Number of indexed characters if the
                                                    column is only
                          partly indexed.
                                 `NULL' if the entire key is indexed.
`Comment'                 Various remarks.  For now, it tells
                                                    whether index is
                          FULLTEXT or not.

Note that as the `Cardinality' is counted based on statistics stored as
integers, it's not necessarily accurate for small tables.

`SHOW TABLE STATUS'
...................

     SHOW TABLE STATUS [FROM db_name] [LIKE wild]

`SHOW TABLE STATUS' (new in Version 3.23) works likes `SHOW STATUS',
but provides a lot of information about each table. You can also get
this list using the `mysqlshow --status db_name' command.  The
following columns are returned:

*Column*               *Meaning*
`Name'                 Name of the table.
`Type'                 Type of table. *Note Table types::.
`Row_format'           The row storage format (Fixed, Dynamic, or
                       Compressed).
`Rows'                 Number of rows.
`Avg_row_length'       Average row length.
`Data_length'          Length of the data file.
`Max_data_length'      Max length of the data file.
`Index_length'         Length of the index file.
`Data_free'            Number of allocated but not used bytes.
`Auto_increment'       Next autoincrement value.
`Create_time'          When the table was created.
`Update_time'          When the data file was last updated.
`Check_time'           When the table was last checked.
`Create_options'       Extra options used with `CREATE TABLE'.
`Comment'              The comment used when creating the table (or some
                       information why MySQL couldn't access the table
                       information).

`InnoDB' tables will report the free space in the tablespace in the
table comment.

The status variables listed above have the following meaning:

*Variable*                *Meaning*
`Aborted_clients'         Number of connections aborted because the
                          client died without closing the connection
                          properly. *Note Communication errors::.
`Aborted_connects'        Number of tries to connect to the MySQL server
                          that failed. *Note Communication errors::.
`Bytes_received'          Number of bytes received from all clients.
`Bytes_sent'              Number of bytes sent to all clients.
`Com_xxxx'                Number of times the xxx commands has been
                          executed.
`Connections'             Number of connection attempts to the MySQL
                          server.
`Created_tmp_disk_tables' Number of implicit temporary tables on disk
                          created while executing statements.
`Created_tmp_tables'      Number of implicit temporary tables in memory
                          created while executing statements.
`Created_tmp_files'       How many temporary files `mysqld' have created.
`Delayed_insert_threads'  Number of delayed insert handler threads in
                          use.
`Delayed_writes'          Number of rows written with `INSERT DELAYED'.
`Delayed_errors'          Number of rows written with `INSERT DELAYED'
                          for which some error occurred (probably
                          `duplicate key').
`Flush_commands'          Number of executed `FLUSH' commands.
`Handler_delete'          Number of times a row was deleted from a table.
`Handler_read_first'      Number of times the first entry was read from
                          an index.  If this is high, it suggests that
                          the server is doing a lot of full index scans,
                          for example, `SELECT col1 FROM foo', assuming
                          that col1 is indexed.
`Handler_read_key'        Number of requests to read a row based on a
                          key. If this is high, it is a good indication
                          that your queries and tables are properly
                          indexed.
`Handler_read_next'       Number of requests to read next row in key
                          order. This will be incremented if you are
                          querying an index column with a range
                          constraint. This also will be incremented if
                          you are doing an index scan.
`Handler_read_rnd'        Number of requests to read a row based on a
                          fixed position.  This will be high if you are
                          doing a lot of queries that require sorting of
                          the result.
`Handler_read_rnd_next'   Number of requests to read the next row in the
                          datafile.  This will be high if you are doing
                          a lot of table scans. Generally this suggests
                          that your tables are not properly indexed or
                          that your queries are not written to take
                          advantage of the indexes you have.
`Handler_update'          Number of requests to update a row in a table.
`Handler_write'           Number of requests to insert a row in a table.
`Key_blocks_used'         The number of used blocks in the key cache.
`Key_read_requests'       The number of requests to read a key block
                          from the cache.
`Key_reads'               The number of physical reads of a key block
                          from disk.
`Key_write_requests'      The number of requests to write a key block to
                          the cache.
`Key_writes'              The number of physical writes of a key block
                          to disk.
`Max_used_connections'    The maximum number of connections in use
                          simultaneously.
`Not_flushed_key_blocks'  Keys blocks in the key cache that has changed
                          but hasn't yet been flushed to disk.
`Not_flushed_delayed_rows'Number of rows waiting to be written in
                          `INSERT DELAY' queues.
`Open_tables'             Number of tables that are open.
`Open_files'              Number of files that are open.
`Open_streams'            Number of streams that are open (used mainly
                          for logging).
`Opened_tables'           Number of tables that have been opened.
`Select_full_join'        Number of joins without keys (If this is 0,
                          you should carefully check the index of your
                          tables).
`Select_full_range_join'  Number of joins where we used a range search
                          on reference table.
`Select_range'            Number of joins where we used ranges on the
                          first table. (It's normally not critical even
                          if this is big.)
`Select_scan'             Number of joins where we did a full scann of
                          the first table.
`Select_range_check'      Number of joins without keys where we check
                          for key usage after each row (If this is 0,
                          you should carefully check the index of your
                          tables).
`Questions'               Number of queries sent to the server.
`Slave_open_temp_tables'  Number of temporary tables currently open by
                          the slave thread
`Slow_launch_threads'     Number of threads that have taken more than
                          `slow_launch_time' to create.
`Slow_queries'            Number of queries that have taken more than
                          `long_query_time'. *Note Slow query log::.
`Sort_merge_passes'       Number of merges passes the sort algoritm have
                          had to do. If this value is large you should
                          consider increasing `sort_buffer'.
`Sort_range'              Number of sorts that where done with ranges.
`Sort_rows'               Number of sorted rows.
`Sort_scan'               Number of sorts that where done by scanning
                          the table.
`Table_locks_immediate'   Number of times a table lock was acquired
                          immediately. Available after 3.23.33.
`Table_locks_waited'      Number of times a table lock could not be
                          acquired immediately and a wait was needed. If
                          this is high, and you have performance
                          problems, you should first optimize your
                          queries, and then either split your table(s)
                          or use replication. Available after 3.23.33.
`Threads_cached'          Number of threads in the thread cache.
`Threads_connected'       Number of currently open connections.
`Threads_created'         Number of threads created to handle
                          connections.
`Threads_running'         Number of threads that are not sleeping.
`Uptime'                  How many seconds the server has been up.

Some comments about the above:

   * If `Opened_tables' is big, then your `table_cache' variable is
     probably too small.

   * If `key_reads' is big, then your `key_buffer_size' variable is
     probably too small.  The cache hit rate can be calculated with
     `key_reads'/`key_read_requests'.

   * If `Handler_read_rnd' is big, then you probably have a lot of
     queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables or you have joins
     that don't use keys properly.

   * If `Threads_created' is big, you may want to increase the
     `thread_cache_size' variable.

     SHOW VARIABLES [LIKE wild]

`SHOW VARIABLES' shows the values of some MySQL system variables.  You
can also get this information using the `mysqladmin variables' command.
If the default values are unsuitable, you can set most of these
variables using command-line options when `mysqld' starts up.  *Note
Command-line options::.

     +-------------------------+---------------------------+

Each option is described below. Values for buffer sizes, lengths, and
stack sizes are given in bytes.  You can specify values with a suffix
of `K' or `M' to indicate kilobytes or megabytes. For example, `16M'
indicates 16 megabytes.  The case of suffix letters does not matter;
`16M' and `16m' are equivalent:

``ansi_mode'.'
     Is `ON' if `mysqld' was started with `--ansi'.  *Note ANSI mode::.

``back_log''
     The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have. This
     comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets *VERY* many
     connection requests in a very short time. It then takes some time
     (although very little) for the main thread to check the connection
     and start a new thread. The `back_log' value indicates how many
     requests can be stacked during this short time before MySQL
     momentarily stops answering new requests. You need to increase
     this only if you expect a large number of connections in a short
     period of time.

     In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for
     incoming TCP/IP connections.  Your operating system has its own
     limit on the size of this queue.  The manual page for the Unix
     `listen(2)' system call should have more details.  Check your OS
     documentation for the maximum value for this variable.  Attempting
     to set `back_log' higher than your operating system limit will be
     ineffective.

``basedir''
     The value of the `--basedir' option.

``bdb_cache_size''
     The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for `BDB'
     tables.  If you don't use `BDB' tables, you should start `mysqld'
     with `--skip-bdb' to not waste memory for this cache.

``bdb_log_buffer_size''
     The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for `BDB'
     tables.  If you don't use `BDB' tables, you should set this to 0 or
     start `mysqld' with `--skip-bdb' to not waste memory for this
     cache.

``bdb_home''
     The value of the `--bdb-home' option.

``bdb_max_lock''
     The maximum number of locks (1000 by default) you can have active
     on a BDB table. You should increase this if you get errors of type
     `bdb: Lock table is out of available locks' or `Got error 12 from
     ...' when you have do long transactions or when `mysqld' has to
     examine a lot of rows to calculate the query.

``bdb_logdir''
     The value of the `--bdb-logdir' option.

``bdb_shared_data''
     Is `ON' if you are using `--bdb-shared-data'.

``bdb_tmpdir''
     The value of the `--bdb-tmpdir' option.

``binlog_cache_size'.  The size of the cache to hold the SQL'
     statements for the binary log during a transaction.  If you often
     use big, multi-statement transactions you can increase this to get
     more performance. *Note COMMIT::.

``character_set''
     The default character set.

``character_sets''
     The supported character sets.

``concurrent_inserts''
     If `ON' (the default), MySQL will allow you to use `INSERT' on
     `MyISAM' tables at the same time as you run `SELECT' queries on
     them.  You can turn this option off by starting `mysqld' with
     `--safe' or `--skip-new'.

``connect_timeout''
     The number of seconds the `mysqld' server is waiting for a connect
     packet before responding with `Bad handshake'.

``datadir''
     The value of the `--datadir' option.

``delay_key_write''
     If enabled (is on by default), MySQL will honor the
     `delay_key_write' option `CREATE TABLE'.  This means that the key
     buffer for tables with this option will not get flushed on every
     index update, but only when a table is closed.  This will speed up
     writes on keys a lot, but you should add automatic checking of all
     tables with `myisamchk --fast --force' if you use this.  Note that
     if you start `mysqld' with the `--delay-key-write-for-all-tables'
     option this means that all tables will be treated as if they were
     created with the `delay_key_write' option.  You can clear this flag
     by starting `mysqld' with `--skip-new' or `--safe-mode'.

``delayed_insert_limit''
     After inserting `delayed_insert_limit' rows, the `INSERT DELAYED'
     handler will check if there are any `SELECT' statements pending.
     If so, it allows these to execute before continuing.

``delayed_insert_timeout''
     How long a `INSERT DELAYED' thread should wait for `INSERT'
     statements before terminating.

``delayed_queue_size''
     What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for handling `INSERT
     DELAYED'.  If the queue becomes full, any client that does `INSERT
     DELAYED' will wait until there is room in the queue again.

``flush''
     This is `ON' if you have started MySQL with the `--flush' option.

``flush_time''
     If this is set to a non-zero value, then every `flush_time'
     seconds all tables will be closed (to free up resources and sync
     things to disk). We only recommend this option on Win95, Win98, or
     on systems where you have very little resources.

``have_bdb''
     `YES' if `mysqld' supports Berkeley DB tables. `DISABLED' if
     `--skip-bdb' is used.

``have_innodb''
     `YES' if `mysqld' supports InnoDB tables. `DISABLED' if
     `--skip-innodb' is used.

``have_raid''
     `YES' if `mysqld' supports the `RAID' option.

``have_ssl''
     `YES' if `mysqld' supports SSL (encryption) on the client/server
     protocol.

``init_file''
     The name of the file specified with the `--init-file' option when
     you start the server.  This is a file of SQL statements you want
     the server to execute when it starts.

``interactive_timeout''
     The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an
     interactive connection before closing it.  An interactive client
     is defined as a client that uses the `CLIENT_INTERACTIVE' option to
     `mysql_real_connect()'.  See also `wait_timeout'.

``join_buffer_size''
     The size of the buffer that is used for full joins (joins that do
     not use indexes).  The buffer is allocated one time for each full
     join between two tables. Increase this value to get a faster full
     join when adding indexes is not possible. (Normally the best way
     to get fast joins is to add indexes.)

``key_buffer_size''
     Index blocks are buffered and are shared by all threads.
     `key_buffer_size' is the size of the buffer used for index blocks.

     Increase this to get better index handling (for all reads and
     multiple writes) to as much as you can afford; 64M on a 256M
     machine that mainly runs MySQL is quite common.  If you, however,
     make this too big (more than 50% of your total memory?) your
     system may start to page and become REALLY slow. Remember that
     because MySQL does not cache data read, that you will have to
     leave some room for the OS filesystem cache.

     You can check the performance of the key buffer by doing `show
     status' and examine the variables `Key_read_requests',
     `Key_reads', `Key_write_requests', and `Key_writes'.  The
     `Key_reads/Key_read_request' ratio should normally be < 0.01.  The
     `Key_write/Key_write_requests' is usually near 1 if you are using
     mostly updates/deletes but may be much smaller if you tend to do
     updates that affect many at the same time or if you are using
     `delay_key_write'. *Note SHOW::.

     To get even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use
     `LOCK TABLES'.  *Note `LOCK TABLES': LOCK TABLES.

``language''
     The language used for error messages.

``large_file_support''
     If `mysqld' was compiled with options for big file support.

``locked_in_memory''
     If `mysqld' was locked in memory with `--memlock'

``log''
     If logging of all queries is enabled.

``log_update''
     If the update log is enabled.

``log_bin''
     If the binary log is enabled.

``log_slave_updates''
     If the updates from the slave should be logged.

``long_query_time''
     If a query takes longer than this (in seconds), the `Slow_queries'
     counter will be incremented. If you are using
     `--log-slow-queries', the query will be logged to the slow query
     logfile. *Note Slow query log::.

``lower_case_table_names''
     If set to 1 table names are stored in lowercase on disk and table
     names will be case-insensitive.  *Note Name case sensitivity::.

``max_allowed_packet''
     The maximum size of one packet. The message buffer is initialized
     to `net_buffer_length' bytes, but can grow up to
     `max_allowed_packet' bytes when needed.  This value by default is
     small, to catch big (possibly wrong) packets.  You must increase
     this value if you are using big `BLOB' columns. It should be as
     big as the biggest `BLOB' you want to use.  The current protocol
     limits `max_allowed_packet' to 16M.

``max_binlog_cache_size''
     If a multi-statement transaction requires more than this amount of
     memory, one will get the error "Multi-statement transaction
     required more than 'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage".

``max_binlog_size''
     Available after 3.23.33. If a write to the binary (replication)
     log exceeds the given value, rotate the logs. You cannot set it to
     less than 1024 bytes, or more than 1 GB. Default is 1 GB.

``max_connections''
     The number of simultaneous clients allowed. Increasing this value
     increases the number of file descriptors that `mysqld' requires.
     See below for comments on file descriptor limits. *Note Too many
     connections::.

``max_connect_errors''
     If there is more than this number of interrupted connections from
     a host this host will be blocked from further connections.  You
     can unblock a host with the command `FLUSH HOSTS'.

``max_delayed_threads''
     Don't start more than this number of threads to handle `INSERT
     DELAYED' statements.  If you try to insert data into a new table
     after all `INSERT DELAYED' threads are in use, the row will be
     inserted as if the `DELAYED' attribute wasn't specified.

``max_heap_table_size''
     Don't allow creation of heap tables bigger than this.

``max_join_size''
     Joins that are probably going to read more than `max_join_size'
     records return an error. Set this value if your users tend to
     perform joins that lack a `WHERE' clause, that take a long time,
     and that return millions of rows.

``max_sort_length''
     The number of bytes to use when sorting `BLOB' or `TEXT' values
     (only the first `max_sort_length' bytes of each value are used;
     the rest are ignored).

``max_user_connections''
     The maximum number of active connections for a single user (0 = no
     limit).

``max_tmp_tables''
     (This option doesn't yet do anything.)  Maximum number of
     temporary tables a client can keep open at the same time.

``max_write_lock_count''
     After this many write locks, allow some read locks to run in
     between.

``myisam_recover_options''
     The value of the `--myisam-recover' option.

``myisam_sort_buffer_size''
     The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when doing a
     `REPAIR' or when creating indexes with `CREATE INDEX' or `ALTER
     TABLE'.

``myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size'.'
     If the creating of the temporary file for fast index creation
     would be this much bigger than using the key cache, then prefer
     the key cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character
     keys in large tables to use the slower key cache method to create
     the index.  *NOTE* that this parameter is given in megabytes!

``myisam_max_sort_file_size''
     The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use
     while recreating the index (during `REPAIR', `ALTER TABLE' or
     `LOAD DATA INFILE'.  If the file size would be bigger than this,
     the index will be created through the key cache (which is slower).
     *NOTE* that this parameter is given in megabytes!

``net_buffer_length''
     The communication buffer is reset to this size between queries.
     This should not normally be changed, but if you have very little
     memory, you can set it to the expected size of a query.  (That is,
     the expected length of SQL statements sent by clients.  If
     statements exceed this length, the buffer is automatically
     enlarged, up to `max_allowed_packet' bytes.)

``net_read_timeout''
     Number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before
     aborting the read.  Note that when we don't expect data from a
     connection, the timeout is defined by `write_timeout'. See also
     `slave_read_timeout'.

``net_retry_count''
     If a read on a communication port is interrupted, retry this many
     times before giving up.  This value should be quite high on
     `FreeBSD' as internal interrupts are sent to all threads.

``net_write_timeout''
     Number of seconds to wait for a block to be written to a
     connection before aborting the write.

``open_files_limit''
     If this is not 0, then `mysqld' will use this value to reserve file
     descriptors to use with `setrlimit()'.  If this value is 0 then
     `mysqld' will reserve `max_connections*5' or `max_connections +
     table_cache*2' (whichever is larger) number of files.  You should
     try increasing this if `mysqld' gives you the error 'Too many open
     files'.

``pid_file''
     The value of the `--pid-file' option.

``port''
     The value of the `--port' option.

``protocol_version''
     The protocol version used by the MySQL server.

``record_buffer''
     Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this
     size for each table it scans. If you do many sequential scans, you
     may want to increase this value.

``record_rnd_buffer''
     When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read
     through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks.  If not set, then it's
     set to the value of `record_buffer'.

``query_buffer_size''
     The initial allocation of the query buffer. If most of your
     queries are long (like when inserting blobs), you should increase
     this!

``safe_show_databases''
     Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any database
     or table privileges. This can improve security if you're concerned
     about people being able to see what databases other users have.
     See also `skip_show_databases'.

``server_id''
     The value of the `--server-id' option.

``skip_locking''
     Is OFF if `mysqld' uses external locking.

``skip_networking''
     Is ON if we only allow local (socket) connections.

``skip_show_databases''
     This prevents people from doing `SHOW DATABASES' if they don't have
     the `PROCESS_PRIV' privilege. This can improve security if you're
     concerned about people being able to see what databases other users
     have. See also `safe_show_databases'.

``slave_read_timeout''
     Number of seconds to wait for more data from a master/slave
     connection before aborting the read.

``slow_launch_time''
     If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in seconds),
     the `Slow_launch_threads' counter will be incremented.

``socket''
     The Unix socket used by the server.

``sort_buffer''
     Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this
     size. Increase this value for faster `ORDER BY' or `GROUP BY'
     operations.  *Note Temporary files::.

``table_cache''
     The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
     increases the number of file descriptors that `mysqld' requires.
     MySQL needs two file descriptors for each unique open table.  See
     below for comments on file descriptor limits. You can check if you
     need to increase the table cache by checking the `Opened_tables'
     variable. *Note SHOW::.  If this variable is big and you don't do
     `FLUSH TABLES' a lot (which just forces all tables to be closed and
     reopenend), then you should increase the value of this variable.

     Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open
     file descriptors implied by the `table_cache' setting.  If
     `table_cache' is set too high, MySQL may run out of file
     descriptors and refuse connections, fail to perform queries, and
     be very unreliable.

     For information about how the table cache works, see *Note Table
     cache::.

``table_type''
     The default table type

``thread_cache_size''
     How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse.  When a
     client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if
     there aren't more than `thread_cache_size' threads from before.
     All new threads are first taken from the cache, and only when the
     cache is empty is a new thread created.  This variable can be
     increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new
     connections. (Normally this doesn't give a notable performance
     improvement if you have a good thread implementation.)  By examing
     the difference between the `Connections' and `Threads_created' you
     can see how efficient the current thread cache is for you.

``thread_concurrency''
     On Solaris, `mysqld' will call `thr_setconcurrency()' with this
     value.  `thr_setconcurrency()' permits the application to give the
     threads system a hint for the desired number of threads that should
     be run at the same time.

``thread_stack''
     The stack size for each thread.  Many of the limits detected by the
     `crash-me' test are dependent on this value. The default is large
     enough for normal operation.  *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

``timezone''
     The timezone for the server.

``tmp_table_size''
     If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL will
     automatically convert it to an on-disk `MyISAM' table.  Increase
     the value of `tmp_table_size' if you do many advanced `GROUP BY'
     queries and you have lots of memory.

``tmpdir''
     The directory used for temporary files and temporary tables.

``version''
     The version number for the server.

``wait_timeout''
     The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
     connection before closing it. See also `interactive_timeout'.

The manual section that describes tuning MySQL contains some
information of how to tune the above variables. *Note Server
parameters::.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Character sets,  Next: Languages,  Prev: Localization,  Up: Localization

The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting
-------------------------------------------

By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set with
sorting according to Swedish/Finnish. This is the character set suitable
in the USA and western Europe.

All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
`--with-extra-charsets=complex'.  This will add code to all standard
programs to be able to handle `latin1' and all multi-byte character
sets within the binary. Other character sets will be loaded from a
character-set definition file when needed.

The character set determines what characters are allowed in names and
how things are sorted by the `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' clauses of the
`SELECT' statement.

You can change the character set with the `--default-character-set'
option when you start the server.  The character sets available depend
on the `--with-charset=charset' and `--with-extra-charset=
list-of-charset | complex | all' options to `configure', and the
character set configuration files listed in `SHAREDIR/charsets/Index'.
*Note configure options::.

If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may also
change the sort order), you must run myisamchk -r -q on all tables.
Otherwise your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

When a client connects to a MySQL server, the server sends the default
character set in use to the client.  The client will switch to use this
character set for this connection.

One should use `mysql_real_escape_string()' when escaping strings for a
SQL query.  `mysql_real_escape_string()' is identical to the old
`mysql_escape_string()' function, except that it takes the MYSQL
connection handle as the first parameter.

If the client is compiled with different paths than where the server is
installed and the user who configured MySQL didn't included all
character sets in the MySQL binary, one must specify for the client
where it can find the additional character sets it will need if the
server runs with a different character set than the client.

One can specify this by putting in a MySQL option file:

     [client]
     character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets

where the path points to where the dynamic MySQL character sets are
stored.

One can force the client to use specific character set by specifying:

     [client]
     default-character-set=character-set-name

but normally this is never needed.

Non-English Error Messages
--------------------------

`mysqld' can issue error messages in the following languages: Czech,
Danish, Dutch, English (the default), Estonian, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Norwegian-ny, Polish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish.

To start `mysqld' with a particular language, use either the
`--language=lang' or `-L lang' options. For example:

     shell> mysqld --language=swedish

or:

     shell> mysqld --language=/usr/local/share/swedish

Note that all language names are specified in lowercase.

The language files are located (by default) in
`MYSQL_BASE_DIR/share/LANGUAGE/'.

To update the error message file, you should edit the `errmsg.txt' file
and execute the following command to generate the `errmsg.sys' file:

     shell> comp_err errmsg.txt errmsg.sys

If you upgrade to a newer version of MySQL, remember to repeat your
changes with the new `errmsg.txt' file.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Adding character set,  Next: Character arrays,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Localization

Adding a New Character Set
--------------------------

To add another character set to MySQL, use the following procedure.

Decide if the set is simple or complex.  If the character set does not
need to use special string collating routines for sorting and does not
need multi-byte character support, it is simple.  If it needs either of
those features, it is complex.

For example, `latin1' and `danish' are simple charactersets while
`big5' or `czech' are complex character sets.

In the following section, we have assumed that you name your character
set `MYSET'.

For a simple character set do the following:

  1. Add MYSET to the end of the `sql/share/charsets/Index' file Assign
     an unique number to it.

  2. Create the file `sql/share/charsets/MYSET.conf'.  (You can use
     `sql/share/charsets/latin1.conf' as a base for this).

     The syntax for the file very simple:

        * Comments start with a '#' character and proceed to the end of
          the line.

        * Words are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.

        * When defining the character set, every word must be a number
          in hexadecimal format

        * The `ctype' array takes up the first 257 words. The
          `to_lower', `to_upper' and `sort_order' arrays take up 256
          words each after that.

     *Note Character arrays::.

  3. Add the character set name to the `CHARSETS_AVAILABLE' and
     `COMPILED_CHARSETS' lists in `configure.in'.

  4. Reconfigure, recompile, and test.


For a complex character set do the following:

  1. Create the file `strings/ctype-MYSET.c' in the MySQL source
     distribution.

  2. Add MYSET to the end of the `sql/share/charsets/Index' file.
     Assign an unique number to it.

  3. Look at one of the existing `ctype-*.c' files to see what needs to
     be defined, for example `strings/ctype-big5.c'. Note that the
     arrays in your file must have names like `ctype_MYSET',
     `to_lower_MYSET', and so on.  This corresponds to the arrays in
     the simple character set. *Note Character arrays::.  For a complex
     character set

  4. Near the top of the file, place a special comment like this:

          /*
           * This comment is parsed by configure to create ctype.c,
           * so don't change it unless you know what you are doing.
           *
           * .configure. number_MYSET=MYNUMBER
           * .configure. strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N
           * .configure. mbmaxlen_MYSET=N
           */

     The `configure' program uses this comment to include the character
     set into the MySQL library automatically.

     The strxfrm_multiply and mbmaxlen lines will be explained in the
     following sections.  Only include them if you the string collating
     functions or the multi-byte character set functions, respectively.

  5. You should then create some of the following functions:

        * `my_strncoll_MYSET()'

        * `my_strcoll_MYSET()'

        * `my_strxfrm_MYSET()'

        * `my_like_range_MYSET()'

     *Note String collating::.

  6. Add the character set name to the `CHARSETS_AVAILABLE' and
     `COMPILED_CHARSETS' lists in `configure.in'.

  7. Reconfigure, recompile, and test.

The file `sql/share/charsets/README' includes some more instructions.

If you want to have the character set included in the MySQL
distribution, mail a patch to <internals@lists.mysql.com>.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Character arrays,  Next: String collating,  Prev: Adding character set,  Up: Localization

The character definition arrays
-------------------------------

`to_lower[]' and `to_upper[]' are simple arrays that hold the lowercase
and uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the character
set.  For example:

     to_lower['A'] should contain 'a'
     to_upper['a'] should contain 'A'

`sort_order[]' is a map indicating how characters should be ordered for
comparison and sorting purposes.  For many character sets, this is the
same as `to_upper[]' (which means sorting will be case insensitive).
MySQL will sort characters based on the value of
`sort_order[character]'.  For more complicated sorting rules, see the
discussion of string collating below. *Note String collating::.

`ctype[]' is an array of bit values, with one element for one character.
(Note that `to_lower[]', `to_upper[]', and `sort_order[]' are indexed
by character value, but `ctype[]' is indexed by character value + 1.
This is an old legacy to be able to handle EOF.)

You can find the following bitmask definitions in `m_ctype.h':

     #define _U      01      /* Uppercase */
     #define _L      02      /* Lowercase */
     #define _N      04      /* Numeral (digit) */
     #define _S      010     /* Spacing character */
     #define _P      020     /* Punctuation */
     #define _C      040     /* Control character */
     #define _B      0100    /* Blank */
     #define _X      0200    /* heXadecimal digit */

The `ctype[]' entry for each character should be the union of the
applicable bitmask values that describe the character.  For example,
`'A'' is an uppercase character (`_U') as well as a hexadecimal digit
(`_X'), so `ctype['A'+1]' should contain the value:

     _U + _X = 01 + 0200 = 0201

String Collating Support
------------------------

If the sorting rules for your language are too complex to be handled
with the simple `sort_order[]' table, you need to use the string
collating functions.

Right now the best documentation on this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the big5, czech, gbk, sjis, and tis160
character sets for examples.

You must specify the `strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N' value in the special
comment at the top of the file.  `N' should be set to the maximum ratio
the strings may grow during `my_strxfrm_MYSET' (it must be a positive
integer).


File: mysql.info,  Node: Multi-byte characters,  Prev: String collating,  Up: Localization

Multi-byte Character Support
----------------------------

If your want to add support for a new character set that includes
multi-byte characters, you need to use the multi-byte character
functions.

Right now the best documentation on this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the euc_kr, gb2312, gbk, sjis and ujis
character sets for examples. These are implemented in the
`ctype-'charset'.c' files in the `strings' directory.

You must specify the `mbmaxlen_MYSET=N' value in the special comment at
the top of the source file.  `N' should be set to the size in bytes of
the largest character in the set.

Overview of the Server-Side Scripts and Utilities
-------------------------------------------------

All MySQL clients that communicate with the server using the
`mysqlclient' library use the following environment variables:

*Name*             *Description*
`MYSQL_UNIX_PORT'  The default socket; used for connections to
                   `localhost'
`MYSQL_TCP_PORT'   The default TCP/IP port
`MYSQL_PWD'        The default password
`MYSQL_DEBUG'      Debug-trace options when debugging
`TMPDIR'           The directory where temporary tables/files are created

Use of `MYSQL_PWD' is insecure.  *Note Connecting::.

The `mysql' client uses the file named in the `MYSQL_HISTFILE'
environment variable to save the command-line history. The default
value for the history file is `$HOME/.mysql_history', where `$HOME' is
the value of the `HOME' environment variable. *Note Environment
variables::.

All MySQL programs take many different options. However, every MySQL
program provides a `--help' option that you can use to get a full
description of the program's different options. For example, try `mysql
--help'.

You can override default options for all standard client programs with
an option file. *Note Option files::.

The list below briefly describes the MySQL programs:

`myisamchk'
     Utility to describe, check, optimize, and repair MySQL tables.
     Because `myisamchk' has many functions, it is described in its own
     chapter. *Note MySQL Database Administration::.

`make_binary_distribution'
     Makes a binary release of a compiled MySQL. This could be sent by
     FTP to `/pub/mysql/Incoming' on `support.mysql.com' for the
     convenience of other MySQL users.

`msql2mysql'
     A shell script that converts `mSQL' programs to MySQL. It doesn't
     handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

`mysqlaccess'
     A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and
     database combination.

`mysqladmin'
     Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating
     or dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables
     to disk, and reopening log files.  `mysqladmin' can also be used
     to retrieve version, process, and status information from the
     server.  *Note `mysqladmin': mysqladmin.

`mysqlbug'
     The MySQL bug report script.  This script should always be used
     when filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

`mysqld'
     The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

`mysqldump'
     Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or as
     tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor
     Romanenko.  *Note `mysqldump': mysqldump.

`mysqlimport'
     Imports text files into their respective tables using `LOAD DATA
     INFILE'. *Note `mysqlimport': mysqlimport.

`mysqlshow'
     Displays information about databases, tables, columns, and indexes.

`mysql_install_db'
     Creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. This is
     usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL on a
     system.

`replace'
     A utility program that is used by `msql2mysql', but that has more
     general applicability as well.  `replace' changes strings in place
     in files or on the standard input. Uses a finite state machine to
     match longer strings first. Can be used to swap strings. For
     example, this command swaps `a' and `b' in the given files:

          shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

safe_mysqld, the wrapper around mysqld
--------------------------------------

`safe_mysqld' is the recommended way to start a `mysqld' daemon on
Unix.  `safe_mysqld' adds some safety features such as restarting the
server when an error occurs and logging run-time information to a log
file.

If you don't use `--mysqld=#' or `--mysqld-version=#' `safe_mysqld'
will use an executable named `mysqld-max' if it exists. If not,
`safe_mysqld' will start `mysqld'.  This makes it very easy to test to
use `mysqld-max' instead of `mysqld';  Just copy `mysqld-max' to where
you have `mysqld' and it will be used.

Normally one should never edit the `safe_mysqld' script, but instead
put the options to `safe_mysqld' in the `[safe_mysqld]' section in the
`my.cnf' file. `safe_mysqld' will read all options from the `[mysqld]',
`[server]' and `[safe_mysqld]' sections from the option files.  *Note
Option files::.

Note that all options on the command line to `safe_mysqld' are passed
to `mysqld'.  If you wants to use any options in `safe_mysqld' that
`mysqld' doesn't support, you must specify these in the option file.

Most of the options to `safe_mysqld' are the same as the options to
`mysqld'. *Note Command-line options::.

`safe_mysqld' supports the following options:

`--basedir=path'

`--core-file-size=#'
     Size of the core file `mysqld' should be able to create. Passed to
     `ulimit -c'.

`--datadir=path'

`--defaults-extra-file=path'

`--defaults-file=path'

`--err-log=path'

`--ledir=path'
     Path to `mysqld'

`--log=path'

`--mysqld=mysqld-version'
     Name of the `mysqld' version in the `ledir' directory you want to
     start.

`--mysqld-version=version'
     Similar to `--mysqld=' but here you only give the suffix for
     `mysqld'.  For example if you use `--mysqld-version=max',
     `safe_mysqld' will start the `ledir/mysqld-max' version.  If the
     argument to `--mysqld-version' is empty, `ledir/mysqld' will be
     used.

`--no-defaults'

`--open-files-limit=#'
     Number of files `mysqld' should be able to open. Passed to `ulimit
     -n'. Note that you need to start `safe_mysqld' as root for this to
     work properly!

`--pid-file=path'

`--port=#'

`--socket=path'

`--timezone=#'
     Set the timezone (the `TZ') variable to the value of this
     parameter.

`--user=#'
The `safe_mysqld' script is written so that it normally is able to start
a server that was installed from either a source or a binary version of
MySQL, even if these install the server in slightly different
locations.  `safe_mysqld' expects one of these conditions to be true:

   * The server and databases can be found relative to the directory
     from which `safe_mysqld' is invoked.  `safe_mysqld' looks under
     its working directory for `bin' and `data' directories (for binary
     distributions) or for `libexec' and `var' directories (for source
     distributions).  This condition should be met if you execute
     `safe_mysqld' from your MySQL installation directory (for example,
     `/usr/local/mysql' for a binary distribution).

   * If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the
     working directory, `safe_mysqld' attempts to locate them by
     absolute pathnames.  Typical locations are `/usr/local/libexec'
     and `/usr/local/var'.  The actual locations are determined when
     the distribution was built from which `safe_mysqld' comes.  They
     should be correct if MySQL was installed in a standard location.

Because `safe_mysqld' will try to find the server and databases relative
to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
MySQL anywhere, as long as you start `safe_mysqld' from the MySQL
installation directory:

     shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
     shell> bin/safe_mysqld &

If `safe_mysqld' fails, even when invoked from the MySQL installation
directory, you can modify it to use the path to `mysqld' and the
pathname options that are correct for your system.  Note that if you
upgrade MySQL in the future, your modified version of `safe_mysqld'
will be overwritten, so you should make a copy of your edited version
that you can reinstall.

mysqld_multi, program for managing multiple MySQL servers
---------------------------------------------------------

`mysqld_multi' is meant for managing several `mysqld' processes running
in different UNIX sockets and TCP/IP ports.

The program will search for group(s) named [mysqld#] from my.cnf (or the
given -config-file=...), where # can be any positive number starting
from 1. These groups should be the same as the usual `[mysqld]' group
(e.g. options to mysqld, see MySQL manual for detailed information
about this group), but with those port, socket etc. options that are
wanted for each separate `mysqld' processes. The number in the group
name has another function; it can be used for starting, stopping, or
reporting some specific `mysqld' servers with this program. See the
usage and options below for more information.

     Usage: mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR,GNR,GNR...]
     or     mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR-GNR,GNR,GNR-GNR,...]

The GNR above means the group number. You can start, stop or report any
GNR, or several of them at the same time. (See -example) The GNRs list
can be comma separated, or a dash combined, of which the latter means
that all the GNRs between GNR1-GNR2 will be affected. Without GNR
argument all the found groups will be either started, stopped, or
reported. Note that you must not have any white spaces in the GNR list.
Anything after a white space is ignored.

`mysqld_multi' supports the following options:

`--config-file=...'
     Alternative config file. NOTE: This will not affect this program's
     own options (group `[mysqld_multi]'), but only groups [mysqld#].
     Without this option everything will be searched from the ordinary
     my.cnf file.

`--example'
     Give an example of a config file.

`--help'
     Print this help and exit.

`--log=...'
     Log file. Full path to and the name for the log file. NOTE: If the
     file exists, everything will be appended.

`--mysqladmin=...'
     `mysqladmin' binary to be used for a server shutdown.

`--mysqld=...'
     `mysqld' binary to be used. Note that you can give `safe_mysqld'
     to this option also. The options are passed to `mysqld'. Just make
     sure you have `mysqld' in your environment variable `PATH' or fix
     `safe_mysqld'.

`--no-log'
     Print to stdout instead of the log file. By default the log file is
     turned on.

`--password=...'
     Password for user for `mysqladmin'.

`--tcp-ip'
     Connect to the MySQL server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead of the
     UNIX socket. This affects stopping and reporting.  If a socket file
     is missing, the server may still be running, but can be accessed
     only via the TCP/IP port.  By default connecting is done via the
     UNIX socket.

`--user=...'
     MySQL user for `mysqladmin'.

`--version'
     Print the version number and exit.

Some notes about `mysqld_multi':

   * Make sure that the MySQL user, who is stopping the `mysqld'
     services (e.g using the `mysqladmin') have the same password and
     username for all the data directories accessed (to the 'mysql'
     database) And make sure that the user has the 'Shutdown_priv'
     privilege! If you have many data- directories and many different
     'mysql' databases with different passwords for the MySQL 'root'
     user, you may want to create a common 'multi_admin' user for each
     using the same password (see below). Example how to do it:
          shell> mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -proot_password -e
          "GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO multi_admin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass'"
          *Note Privileges::.
     You will have to do the above for each `mysqld' running in each
     data directory, that you have (just change the socket, -S=...)

   * `pid-file' is very important, if you are using `safe_mysqld' to
     start `mysqld' (e.g. -mysqld=safe_mysqld) Every `mysqld' should
     have its own `pid-file'. The advantage using `safe_mysqld' instead
     of `mysqld' directly here is, that `safe_mysqld' 'guards' every
     `mysqld' process and will restart it, if a `mysqld' process fails
     due to signal kill -9, or similar. (Like segmentation fault, which
     MySQL should never do, of course ;) Please note that `safe_mysqld'
     script may require that you start it from a certain place. This
     means that you may have to CD to a certain directory, before you
     start the `mysqld_multi'. If you have problems starting, please
     see the `safe_mysqld' script. Check especially the lines:
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------
          MY_PWD=`pwd` Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary
          release) if test -d /data/mysql -a -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys
          -a -x ./bin/mysqld
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------
          *Note `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.
     The above test should be successful, or you may encounter problems.

   * Beware of the dangers starting multiple `mysqlds' in the same data
     directory.  Use separate data directories, unless you *KNOW* what
     you are doing!

   * The socket file and the TCP/IP port must be different for every
     `mysqld'.

   * The first and fifth `mysqld' group were intentionally left out from
     the example.  You may have 'gaps' in the config file. This gives
     you more flexibility.  The order in which the `mysqlds' are
     started or stopped depends on the order in which they appear in
     the config file.

   * When you want to refer to a certain group using GNR with this
     program, just use the number in the end of the group name (
     [mysqld# <== ).

   * You may want to use option '-user' for `mysqld', but in order to
     do this you need to be root when you start the `mysqld_multi'
     script. Having the option in the config file doesn't matter; you
     will just get a warning, if you are not the superuser and the
     `mysqlds' are started under *YOUR* UNIX account. *IMPORTANT*: Make
     sure that the `pid-file' and the data directory are
     read+write(+execute for the latter one) accessible for *THAT* UNIX
     user, who the specific `mysqld' process is started as. *DON'T* use
     the UNIX root account for this, unless you *KNOW* what you are
     doing!

   * *MOST IMPORTANT*: Make sure that you understand the meanings of
     the options that are passed to the `mysqlds' and why *WOULD YOU
     WANT* to have separate `mysqld' processes. Starting multiple
     `mysqlds' in one data directory *WILL NOT* give you extra
     performance in a threaded system!

*Note Multiple servers::.

myisampack, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator
----------------------------------------------------------

`myisampack' is used to compress MyISAM tables, and `pack_isam' is used
to compress ISAM tables. Because ISAM tables are deprecated, we will
only discuss `myisampack' here, but everything said about `myisampack'
should also be true for `pack_isam'.

`myisampack' works by compressing each column in the table separately.
The information needed to decompress columns is read into memory when
the table is opened. This results in much better performance when
accessing individual records, because you only have to uncompress
exactly one record, not a much larger disk block as when using Stacker
on MS-DOS.  Usually, `myisampack' packs the data file 40%-70%.

MySQL uses memory mapping (`mmap()') on compressed tables and falls
back to normal read/write file usage if `mmap()' doesn't work.

There are currently two limitations with `myisampack':
   * After packing, the table is read-only.

   * `myisampack' can also pack `BLOB' or `TEXT' columns. The older
     `pack_isam' could not do this.

Fixing these limitations is on our TODO list but with low priority.

`myisampack' is invoked like this:

     shell> myisampack [options] filename ...

Each filename should be the name of an index (`.MYI') file.  If you are
not in the database directory, you should specify the pathname to the
file.  It is permissible to omit the `.MYI' extension.

`myisampack' supports the following options:

`-b, --backup'
     Make a backup of the table as `tbl_name.OLD'.

`-#, --debug=debug_options'
     Output debug log. The `debug_options' string often is
     `'d:t:o,filename''.

`-f, --force'
     Force packing of the table even if it becomes bigger or if the
     temporary file exists.  `myisampack' creates a temporary file
     named `tbl_name.TMD' while it compresses the table.  If you kill
     `myisampack', the `.TMD' file may not be deleted.  Normally,
     `myisampack' exits with an error if it finds that `tbl_name.TMD'
     exists.  With `--force', `myisampack' packs the table anyway.

`-?, --help'
     Display a help message and exit.

`-j big_tbl_name, --join=big_tbl_name'
     Join all tables named on the command line into a single table
     `big_tbl_name'.  All tables that are to be combined MUST be
     identical (same column names and types, same indexes, etc.).

`-p #, --packlength=#'
     Specify the record length storage size, in bytes.  The value
     should be 1, 2, or 3.  (`myisampack' stores all rows with length
     pointers of 1, 2, or 3 bytes.  In most normal cases, `myisampack'
     can determine the right length value before it begins packing the
     file, but it may notice during the packing process that it could
     have used a shorter length. In this case, `myisampack' will print
     a note that the next time you pack the same file, you could use a
     shorter record length.)

`-s, --silent'
     Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

`-t, --test'
     Don't actually pack table, just test packing it.

`-T dir_name, --tmp_dir=dir_name'
     Use the named directory as the location in which to write the
     temporary table.

`-v, --verbose'
     Verbose mode.  Write information about progress and packing result.

`-V, --version'
     Display version information and exit.

`-w, --wait'
     Wait and retry if table is in use.  If the `mysqld' server was
     invoked with the `--skip-locking' option, it is not a good idea to
     invoke `myisampack' if the table might be updated during the
     packing process.

The information printed by `myisampack' is described below:

`normal'
     The number of columns for which no extra packing is used.

`empty-space'
     The number of columns containing values that are only spaces;
     these will occupy 1 bit.

`empty-zero'
     The number of columns containing values that are only binary 0's;
     these will occupy 1 bit.

`empty-fill'
     The number of integer columns that don't occupy the full byte
     range of their type; these are changed to a smaller type (for
     example, an `INTEGER' column may be changed to `MEDIUMINT').

`pre-space'
     The number of decimal columns that are stored with leading spaces.
     In this case, each value will contain a count for the number of
     leading spaces.

`end-space'
     The number of columns that have a lot of trailing spaces.  In this
     case, each value will contain a count for the number of trailing
     spaces.

`table-lookup'
     The column had only a small number of different values, which were
     converted to an `ENUM' before Huffman compression.

`zero'
     The number of columns for which all values are zero.

`Original trees'
     The initial number of Huffman trees.

`After join'
     The number of distinct Huffman trees left after joining trees to
     save some header space.

After a table has been compressed, `myisamchk -dvv' prints additional
information about each field:

`Type'
     The field type may contain the following descriptors:

    `constant'
          All rows have the same value.

    `no endspace'
          Don't store endspace.

    `no endspace, not_always'
          Don't store endspace and don't do end space compression for
          all values.

    `no endspace, no empty'
          Don't store endspace. Don't store empty values.

    `table-lookup'
          The column was converted to an `ENUM'.

    `zerofill(n)'
          The most significant `n' bytes in the value are always 0 and
          are not stored.

    `no zeros'
          Don't store zeros.

    `always zero'
          0 values are stored in 1 bit.

`Huff tree'
     The Huffman tree associated with the field.

`Bits'
     The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.

After you have run `pack_isam'/`myisampack' you must run
`isamchk'/`myisamchk' to re-create the index.  At this time you can
also sort the index blocks and create statistics needed for the MySQL
optimizer to work more efficiently:

     myisamchk -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.MYI
     isamchk   -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.ISM

After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL database
directory you should do `mysqladmin flush-tables' to force `mysqld' to
start using the new table.

If you want to unpack a packed table, you can do this with the
`--unpack' option to `isamchk' or `myisamchk'.

mysqld-max, An extended mysqld server
-------------------------------------

`mysqld-max' is the MySQL server (`mysqld') configured with the
following configure options:

*Option*               *Comment*
-with-server-suffix=-maxAdd a suffix to the `mysqld' version string.
-with-bdb              Support for Berkeley DB (BDB) tables
-with-innodb           Support for InnoDB tables.
CFLAGS=-DUSE_SYMDIR    Symbolic links support for Windows.

You can find the MySQL-max binaries at
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-max-3.23.html'.

The Windows MySQL 3.23 binary distribution includes both the standard
`mysqld.exe' binary and the `mysqld-max.exe' binary.
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html'.  *Note Windows
installation::.

Note that as Berkeley DB and InnoDB are not available for all platforms,
some of the `Max' binaries may not have support for both of these.  You
can check which table types are supported by doing the following query:

     mysql> show variables like "have_%";
     +---------------+-------+
     | Variable_name | Value |
     +---------------+-------+
     | have_bdb      | YES   |
     | have_innodb   | NO    |
     | have_isam     | YES   |
     | have_raid     | NO    |
     | have_ssl      | NO    |
     +---------------+-------+

The meaning of the values are:

*Value*                *Meaning*.
YES                    The option is activated and usable.
NO                     MySQL is not compiled with support for this
                       option.
DISABLED               The xxxx option is disabled because one started
                       `mysqld' with `--skip-xxxx' or because one didn't
                       start `mysqld' with all needed options to enable
                       the option.  In this case the `hostname.err' file
                       should contain a reason for why the option is
                       disabled.

*NOTE*:  To be able to create InnoDB tables you *MUST* edit your
startup options to include at least the `innodb_data_file_path' option.
*Note InnoDB start::.

To get better performance for BDB tables, you should add some
configuration options for these too. *Note BDB start::.

`safe_mysqld' will automatically try to start any `mysqld' binary with
the `-max' prefix. This makes it very easy to test out a another
`mysqld' binary in an existing installation.  Just run `configure' with
the options you want and then install the new `mysqld' binary as
`mysqld-max' in the same directory where your old `mysqld' binary is.
*Note `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

The `mysqld-max' RPM uses the above mentioned `safe_mysqld' feature. It
just installs the `mysqld-max' executable and `safe_mysqld' will
automatically use this executable when `safe_mysqld' is restarted.

The following table shows which table types our standard *MySQL-Max*
binaries includes:

*System*                      *BDB*                  *InnoDB*
AIX 4.3                       N                      Y
HP-UX 11.0                    N                      Y

Overview of the Client-Side Scripts and Utilities
-------------------------------------------------

All MySQL clients that communicate with the server using the
`mysqlclient' library use the following environment variables:

*Name*             *Description*
`MYSQL_UNIX_PORT'  The default socket; used for connections to
                   `localhost'
`MYSQL_TCP_PORT'   The default TCP/IP port
`MYSQL_PWD'        The default password
`MYSQL_DEBUG'      Debug-trace options when debugging
`TMPDIR'           The directory where temporary tables/files are created

Use of `MYSQL_PWD' is insecure.  *Note Connecting::.

The `mysql' client uses the file named in the `MYSQL_HISTFILE'
environment variable to save the command-line history. The default
value for the history file is `$HOME/.mysql_history', where `$HOME' is
the value of the `HOME' environment variable. *Note Environment
variables::.

All MySQL programs take many different options. However, every MySQL
program provides a `--help' option that you can use to get a full
description of the program's different options. For example, try `mysql
--help'.

You can override default options for all standard client programs with
an option file. *Note Option files::.

The list below briefly describes the MySQL programs:

`myisamchk'
     Utility to describe, check, optimize, and repair MySQL tables.
     Because `myisamchk' has many functions, it is described in its own
     chapter. *Note MySQL Database Administration::.

`make_binary_distribution'
     Makes a binary release of a compiled MySQL. This could be sent by
     FTP to `/pub/mysql/Incoming' on `support.mysql.com' for the
     convenience of other MySQL users.

`msql2mysql'
     A shell script that converts `mSQL' programs to MySQL. It doesn't
     handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

`mysqlaccess'
     A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and
     database combination.

`mysqladmin'
     Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating
     or dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables
     to disk, and reopening log files.  `mysqladmin' can also be used
     to retrieve version, process, and status information from the
     server.  *Note `mysqladmin': mysqladmin.

`mysqlbug'
     The MySQL bug report script.  This script should always be used
     when filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

`mysqld'
     The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

`mysqldump'
     Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or as
     tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor
     Romanenko.  *Note `mysqldump': mysqldump.

`mysqlimport'
     Imports text files into their respective tables using `LOAD DATA
     INFILE'. *Note `mysqlimport': mysqlimport.

`mysqlshow'
     Displays information about databases, tables, columns, and indexes.

`mysql_install_db'
     Creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. This is
     usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL on a
     system.

`replace'
     A utility program that is used by `msql2mysql', but that has more
     general applicability as well.  `replace' changes strings in place
     in files or on the standard input. Uses a finite state machine to
     match longer strings first. Can be used to swap strings. For
     example, this command swaps `a' and `b' in the given files:

          shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

The Command-line Tool
---------------------

`mysql' is a simple SQL shell (with GNU `readline' capabilities).  It
supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used interactively,
query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
tab-separated format.  (The output format can be changed using
command-line options.)  You can run scripts simply like this:

     shell> mysql database < script.sql > output.tab

If you have problems due to insufficient memory in the client, use the
`--quick' option!  This forces `mysql' to use `mysql_use_result()'
rather than `mysql_store_result()' to retrieve the result set.

Using `mysql' is very easy. Just start it as follows: `mysql database'
or `mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password database'. Type a
SQL statement, end it with `;', `\g', or `\G' and press RETURN/ENTER.

`mysql' supports the following options:

`-?, --help'
     Display this help and exit.

`-A, --no-auto-rehash'
     No automatic rehashing. One has to use 'rehash' to get table and
     field completion. This gives a quicker start of mysql.

`-B, --batch'
     Print results with a tab as separator, each row on a new line.
     Doesn't use history file.

`--character-sets-dir=...'
     Directory where character sets are located.

`-C, --compress'
     Use compression in server/client protocol.

`-#, --debug[=...]'
     Debug log. Default is 'd:t:o,/tmp/mysql.trace'.

`-D, --database=...'
     Database to use. This is mainly useful in the `my.cnf' file.

`--default-character-set=...'
     Set the default character set.

`-e, --execute=...'
     Execute command and quit. (Output like with -batch)

`-E, --vertical'
     Print the output of a query (rows) vertically. Without this option
     you can also force this output by ending your statements with `\G'.

`-f, --force'
     Continue even if we get a SQL error.

`-g, --no-named-commands'
     Named commands are disabled. Use \* form only, or use named
     commands only in the beginning of a line ending with a semicolon
     (;). Since Version 10.9, the client now starts with this option
     ENABLED by default!  With the -g option, long format commands will
     still work from the first line, however.

`-G, --enable-named-commands'
     Named commands are *enabled*.  Long format commands are allowed as
     well as shortened \* commands.

`-i, --ignore-space'
     Ignore space after function names.

`-h, --host=...'
     Connect to the given host.

`-H, --html'
     Produce HTML output.

`-L, --skip-line-numbers'
     Don't write line number for errors. Useful when one wants to
     compare result files that includes error messages

`--no-pager'
     Disable pager and print to stdout. See interactive help (\h) also.

`--no-tee'
     Disable outfile. See interactive help (\h) also.

`-n, --unbuffered'
     Flush buffer after each query.

`-N, --skip-column-names'
     Don't write column names in results.

`-O, --set-variable var=option'
     Give a variable a value. `--help' lists variables.

`-o, --one-database'
     Only update the default database. This is useful for skipping
     updates to other database in the update log.

``--pager[=...]''
     Output type. Default is your `ENV' variable `PAGER'. Valid pagers
     are less, more, cat [> filename], etc.  See interactive help (\h)
     also. This option does not work in batch mode. Pager works only in
     UNIX.

`-p[password], --password[=...]'
     Password to use when connecting to server. If a password is not
     given on the command line, you will be prompted for it.  Note that
     if you use the short form `-p' you can't have a space between the
     option and the password.

`-P  --port=...'
     TCP/IP port number to use for connection.

`-q, --quick'
     Don't cache result, print it row-by-row. This may slow down the
     server if the output is suspended. Doesn't use history file.

`-r, --raw'
     Write column values without escape conversion. Used with `--batch'

`-s, --silent'
     Be more silent.

`-S  --socket=...'
     Socket file to use for connection.

`-t  --table'
     Output in table format. This is default in non-batch mode.

`-T, --debug-info'
     Print some debug information at exit.

`--tee=...'
     Append everything into outfile. See interactive help (\h) also.
     Does not work in batch mode.

`-u, --user=#'
     User for login if not current user.

`-U, --safe-updates[=#], --i-am-a-dummy[=#]'
     Only allow `UPDATE' and `DELETE' that uses keys. See below for
     more information about this option.  You can reset this option if
     you have it in your `my.cnf' file by using `--safe-updates=0'.

`-v, --verbose'
     More verbose output (-v -v -v gives the table output format).

`-V, --version'
     Output version information and exit.

`-w, --wait'
     Wait and retry if connection is down instead of aborting.

You can also set the following variables with `-O' or `--set-variable':

Variable Name          Default        Description
connect_timeout        0              Number of seconds before timeout
                                      connection.
max_allowed_packet     16777216       Max packetlength to send/receive
                                      from to server
net_buffer_length      16384          Buffer for TCP/IP and socket
                                      communication
select_limit           1000           Automatic limit for SELECT when
                                      using -i-am-a-dummy
max_join_size          1000000        Automatic limit for rows in a join
                                      when using -i-am-a-dummy.

If you type 'help' on the command line, `mysql' will print out the
commands that it supports:

     mysql> help
     
     MySQL commands:
     help    (\h)    Display this text.
     ?       (\h)    Synonym for `help'.
     clear   (\c)    Clear command.
     connect (\r)    Reconnect to the server. Optional arguments are db and host.
     edit    (\e)    Edit command with $EDITOR.
     ego     (\G)    Send command to mysql server, display result vertically.
     exit    (\q)    Exit mysql. Same as quit.
     go      (\g)    Send command to mysql server.
     nopager (\n)    Disable pager, print to stdout.
     notee   (\t)    Don't write into outfile.
     pager   (\P)    Set PAGER [to_pager]. Print the query results via PAGER.
     print   (\p)    Print current command.
     quit    (\q)    Quit mysql.
     rehash  (\#)    Rebuild completion hash.
     source  (\.)    Execute a SQL script file. Takes a file name as an argument.
     status  (\s)    Get status information from the server.
     tee     (\T)    Set outfile [to_outfile]. Append everything into given outfile.
     use     (\u)    Use another database. Takes database name as argument.

From the above, pager only works in UNIX.

The `status' command gives you some information about the connection
and the server you are using. If you are running in the
`--safe-updates' mode, `status' will also print the values for the
`mysql' variables that affect your queries.

A useful startup option for beginners (introduced in MySQL Version
3.23.11) is `--safe-updates' (or `--i-am-a-dummy' for users that has at
some time done a `DELETE FROM table_name' but forgot the `WHERE'
clause).  When using this option, `mysql' sends the following command
to the MySQL server when opening the connection:

     SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=#select_limit#,
         SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=#max_join_size#"

where `#select_limit#' and `#max_join_size#' are variables that can be
set from the `mysql' command line. *Note `SET': SET OPTION.

The effect of the above is:

   * You are not allowed to do an `UPDATE' or `DELETE' statement if you
     don't have a key constraint in the `WHERE' part. One can, however,
     force an `UPDATE/DELETE' by using `LIMIT':
          UPDATE table_name SET not_key_column=# WHERE not_key_column=# LIMIT 1;

   * All big results are automatically limited to `#select_limit#' rows.

   * `SELECT''s that will probably need to examine more than
     `#max_join_size' row combinations will be aborted.

Some useful hints about the `mysql' client:

Some data is much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of
the usual horizontal box type output. For example longer text, which
includes new lines, is often much easier to be read with vertical
output.

   * For logging, you can use the `tee' option. The `tee' can be
     started with option `--tee=...', or from the command line
     interactively with command `tee'. All the data displayed on the
     screen will also be appended into a given file. This can be very
     useful for debugging purposes also. The `tee' can be disabled from
     the command line with command `notee'. Executing `tee' again
     starts logging again. Without a parameter the previous file will be
     used. Note that `tee' will flush the results into the file after
     each command, just before the command line appears again waiting
     for the next command.

   * Browsing, or searching the results in the interactive mode in UNIX
     less, more, or any other similar program, is now possible with
     option `--pager[=...]'. Without argument, `mysql' client will look
     for environment variable PAGER and set `pager' to that.  `pager'
     can be started from the interactive command line with command
     `pager' and disabled with command `nopager'.  The command takes an
     argument optionally and the `pager' will be set to that. Command
     `pager' can be called without an argument, but this requires that
     the option `--pager' was used, or the `pager' will default to
     stdout. `pager' works only in UNIX, since it uses the popen()
     function, which doesn't exist in Windows. In Windows, the `tee'
     option can be used instead, although it may not be as handy as
     `pager' can be in some situations.

   * A few tips about `pager': You can use it to write to a file:
          mysql> pager cat > /tmp/log.txt
     and the results will only go to a file. You can also pass any
     options for the programs that you want to use with the `pager':
          mysql> pager less -n -i -S
     From the above do note the option '-S'. You may find it very
     useful when browsing the results; try the option with horizontal
     output (end commands with '\g', or ';') and with vertical output
     (end commands with '\G'). Sometimes a very wide result set is hard
     to be read from the screen, with option -S to less you can browse
     the results within the interactive less from left to right,
     preventing lines longer than your screen from being continued to
     the next line. This can make the result set much more readable.
     You can swith the mode between on and off within the interactive
     less with '-S'. See the 'h' for more help about less.

   * Last (unless you already understood this from the above examples
     ;) you can combine very complex ways to handle the results, for
     example the following would send the results to two files in two
     different directories, on two different hard-disks mounted on /dr1
     and /dr2, yet let the results still be seen on the screen via less:
          mysql> pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt | tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S

   * You can also combine the two functions above; have the `tee'
     enabled, `pager' set to 'less' and you will be able to browse the
     results in unix 'less' and still have everything appended into a
     file the same time. The difference between `UNIX tee' used with the
     `pager' and the `mysql' client in-built `tee', is that the
     in-built `tee' works even if you don't have the `UNIX tee'
     available. The in-built `tee' also logs everything that is printed
     on the screen, where the `UNIX tee' used with `pager' doesn't log
     quite that much. Last, but not least, the interactive `tee' is
     more handy to switch on and off, when you want to log something
     into a file, but want to be able to turn the feature off sometimes.

mysqladmin, Administrating a MySQL Server
-----------------------------------------

A utility for performing administrative operations. The syntax is:

     shell> mysqladmin [OPTIONS] command [command-option] command ...

You can get a list of the options your version of `mysqladmin' supports
by executing `mysqladmin --help'.

The current `mysqladmin' supports the following commands:

`create databasename'
     Create a new database.

`drop databasename'
     Delete a database and all its tables.

`extended-status'
     Gives an extended status message from the server.

`flush-hosts'
     Flush all cached hosts.

`flush-logs'
     Flush all logs.

`flush-tables'
     Flush all tables.

`flush-privileges'
     Reload grant tables (same as reload).

`kill id,id,...'
     Kill mysql threads.

`password'
     Set a new password. Change old password to new-password.

`ping'
     Check if mysqld is alive.

`processlist'
     Show list of active threads in server.

`reload'
     Reload grant tables.

`refresh'
     Flush all tables and close and open logfiles.

`shutdown'
     Take server down.

`slave-start'
     Start slave replication thread.

`slave-stop'
     Stop slave replication thread.

`status'
     Gives a short status message from the server.

`variables'
     Prints variables available.

`version'
     Get version info from server.

All commands can be shortened to their unique prefix.  For example:

     shell> mysqladmin proc stat
     +----+-------+-----------+----+-------------+------+-------+------+
     | Id | User  | Host      | db | Command     | Time | State | Info |
     +----+-------+-----------+----+-------------+------+-------+------+
     | 6  | monty | localhost |    | Processlist | 0    |       |      |
     +----+-------+-----------+----+-------------+------+-------+------+

The `mysqladmin status' command result has the following columns:

Uptime                 Number of seconds the MySQL server has been up.
Threads                Number of active threads (clients).
Questions              Number of questions from clients since `mysqld'
                       was started.
Slow queries           Queries that have taken more than
                       `long_query_time' seconds. *Note Slow query log::.
Opens                  How many tables `mysqld' has opened.
Flush tables           Number of `flush ...', `refresh', and `reload'
                       commands.
Open tables            Number of tables that are open now.
Memory in use          Memory allocated directly by the `mysqld' code
                       (only available when MySQL is compiled with
                       -with-debug=full).
Max memory used        Maximum memory allocated directly by the `mysqld'
                       code (only available when MySQL is compiled with
                       -with-debug=full).

If you do `myslqadmin shutdown' on a socket (in other words, on a the
computer where `mysqld' is running), `mysqladmin' will wait until the
MySQL `pid-file' is removed to ensure that the `mysqld' server has
stopped properly.

Using `mysqlcheck' for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery
-----------------------------------------------------------

Since MySQL version 3.23.38 you will be able to use a new checking and
repairing tool for `MyISAM' tables. The difference to `myisamchk' is
that `mysqlcheck' should be used when the `mysqld' server is running,
where as `myisamchk' should be used when it is not. The benefit is that
you no longer have to take the server down for checking or repairing
your tables.

`mysqlcheck' uses MySQL server commands `CHECK', `REPAIR', `ANALYZE'
and `OPTIMIZE' in a convenient way for the user.

There are three alternative ways to invoke `mysqlcheck':

     shell> mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] database [tables]
     shell> mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
     shell> mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --all-databases

So it can be used in a similar way as `mysqldump' when it comes to what
databases and tables you want to choose.

`mysqlcheck' does have a special feature compared to the other clients;
the default behavior, checking tables (-c), can be changed by renaming
the binary. So if you want to have a tool that repairs tables by
default, you should just copy `mysqlcheck' to your harddrive with a new
name, `mysqlrepair', or alternatively make a symbolic link to
`mysqlrepair' and name the symbolic link as `mysqlrepair'. If you
invoke `mysqlrepair' now, it will repair tables by default.

The names that you can use to change `mysqlcheck' default behavior are
here:

     mysqlrepair:   The default option will be -r
     mysqlanalyze:  The default option will be -a
     mysqloptimize: The default option will be -o

The options available for `mysqlcheck' are listed here, please check
what your version supports with `mysqlcheck --help'.

`-A, --all-databases'
     Check all the databases. This will be same as -databases with all
     databases selected

`-1, --all-in-1'
     Instead of making one query for each table, execute all queries in
     1 query separately for each database. Table names will be in a
     comma separated list.

`-a, --analyze'
     Analyze given tables.

`--auto-repair'
     If a checked table is corrupted, automatically fix it. Repairing
     will be done after all tables have been checked, if corrupted ones
     were found.

`-#, --debug=...'
     Output debug log. Often this is 'd:t:o,filename'

`--character-sets-dir=...'
     Directory where character sets are

`-c, --check'
     Check table for errors

`-C, --check-only-changed'
     Check only tables that have changed since last check or haven't
     been closed properly.

`--compress'
     Use compression in server/client protocol.

`-?, --help'
     Display this help message and exit.

`-B, --databases'
     To check several databases. Note the difference in usage; In this
     case no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as
     database names.

`--default-character-set=...'
     Set the default character set

`-F, --fast'
     Check only tables that hasn't been closed properly

`-f, --force'
     Continue even if we get an sql-error.

`-e, --extended'
     If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it will ensure that
     the table is 100 percent consistent, but will take a long time.

     If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will run an
     extended repair on the table, which may not only take a long time
     to execute, but may produce a lot of garbage rows also!

`-h, --host=...'
     Connect to host.

`-m, --medium-check'
     Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99 percent of all
     errors. Should be good enough for most cases.

`-o, --optimize'
     Optimize table

`-p, --password[=...]'
     Password to use when connecting to server. If password is not given
     it's solicited on the tty.

`-P, --port=...'
     Port number to use for connection.

`-q, --quick'
     If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it prevents the
     check from scanning the rows to check for wrong links. This is the
     fastest check.

     If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will try to
     repair only the index tree. This is the fastest repair method for
     a table.

`-r, --repair'
     Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique.

`-s, --silent'
     Print only error messages.

`-S, --socket=...'
     Socket file to use for connection.

`--tables'
     Overrides option -databases (-B).

`-u, --user=#'
     User for login if not current user.

`-v, --verbose'
     Print info about the various stages.

`-V, --version'
     Output version information and exit.

mysqldump, Dumping Table Structure and Data
-------------------------------------------

Utility to dump a database or a collection of database for backup or for
transferring the data to another SQL server (not necessarily a MySQL
server).  The dump will contain SQL statements to create the table
and/or populate the table.

If you are doing a backup on the server, you should consider using the
`mysqlhotcopy' instead. *Note `mysqlhotcopy': mysqlhotcopy.

     shell> mysqldump [OPTIONS] database [tables]
     OR     mysqldump [OPTIONS] --databases [OPTIONS] DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
     OR     mysqldump [OPTIONS] --all-databases [OPTIONS]

If you don't give any tables or use the `--databases' or
`--all-databases', the whole database(s) will be dumped.

You can get a list of the options your version of `mysqldump' supports
by executing `mysqldump --help'.

Note that if you run `mysqldump' without `--quick' or `--opt',
`mysqldump' will load the whole result set into memory before dumping
the result.  This will probably be a problem if you are dumping a big
database.

Note that if you are using a new copy of the `mysqldump' program and
you are going to do a dump that will be read into a very old MySQL
server, you should not use the `--opt' or `-e' options.

`mysqldump' supports the following options:

`--add-locks'
     Add `LOCK TABLES' before and `UNLOCK TABLE' after each table dump.
     (To get faster inserts into MySQL.)

`--add-drop-table'
     Add a `drop table' before each create statement.

`-A, --all-databases'
     Dump all the databases. This will be same as `--databases' with all
     databases selected.

`-a, --all'
     Include all MySQL-specific create options.

`--allow-keywords'
     Allow creation of column names that are keywords.  This works by
     prefixing each column name with the table name.

`-c, --complete-insert'
     Use complete insert statements (with column names).

`-C, --compress'
     Compress all information between the client and the server if both
     support compression.

`-B, --databases'
     To dump several databases. Note the difference in usage. In this
     case no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as
     database names.  `USE db_name;' will be included in the output
     before each new database.

`--delayed'
     Insert rows with the `INSERT DELAYED' command.

`-e, --extended-insert'
     Use the new multiline `INSERT' syntax. (Gives more compact and
     faster inserts statements.)

`-#, --debug[=option_string]'
     Trace usage of the program (for debugging).

`--help'
     Display a help message and exit.

`--fields-terminated-by=...'
`--fields-enclosed-by=...'
`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...'
`--fields-escaped-by=...'
`--lines-terminated-by=...'
     These options are used with the `-T' option and have the same
     meaning as the corresponding clauses for `LOAD DATA INFILE'.
     *Note `LOAD DATA': LOAD DATA.

`-F, --flush-logs'
     Flush log file in the MySQL server before starting the dump.

`-f, --force,'
     Continue even if we get a SQL error during a table dump.

`-h, --host=..'
     Dump data from the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
     is `localhost'.

`-l, --lock-tables.'
     Lock all tables before starting the dump.  The tables are locked
     with `READ LOCAL' to allow concurrent inserts in the case of
     `MyISAM' tables.

`-n, --no-create-db'
     'CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ db_name;' will not be
     put in the output. The above line will be added otherwise, if
     -databases or -all-databases option was given.

`-t, --no-create-info'
     Don't write table creation information (The `CREATE TABLE'
     statement.)

`-d, --no-data'
     Don't write any row information for the table.  This is very
     useful if you just want to get a dump of the structure for a table!

`--opt'
     Same as `--quick --add-drop-table --add-locks --extended-insert
     --lock-tables'.  Should give you the fastest possible dump for
     reading into a MySQL server.

`-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]'
     The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
     no `=your_pass' part, `mysqldump' you will be prompted for a
     password.

`-P port_num, --port=port_num'
     The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a host.  (This is
     used for connections to hosts other than `localhost', for which
     Unix sockets are used.)

`-q, --quick'
     Don't buffer query, dump directly to stdout. Uses
     `mysql_use_result()' to do this.

`-r, --result-file=...'
     Direct output to a given file. This option should be used in MSDOS,
     because it prevents new line '\n' from being converted to '\n\r'
     (new line + carriage return).

`-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket'
     The socket file to use when connecting to `localhost' (which is the
     default host).

`--tables'
     Overrides option -databases (-B).

`-T, --tab=path-to-some-directory'
     Creates a `table_name.sql' file, that contains the SQL CREATE
     commands, and a `table_name.txt' file, that contains the data, for
     each give table.  *NOTE*: This only works if `mysqldump' is run on
     the same machine as the `mysqld' daemon.  The format of the `.txt'
     file is made according to the `--fields-xxx' and `--lines--xxx'
     options.

`-u user_name, --user=user_name'
     The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
     default value is your Unix login name.

`-O var=option, --set-variable var=option'
     Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables are listed
     below.

`-v, --verbose'
     Verbose mode.  Print out more information on what the program does.

`-V, --version'
     Print version information and exit.

`-w, --where='where-condition''
     Dump only selected records. Note that QUOTES are mandatory:

          "--where=user='jimf'" "-wuserid>1" "-wuserid<1"

`-O net_buffer_length=#, where # < 16M'
     When creating multi-row-insert statements (as with option
     `--extended-insert' or `--opt'), `mysqldump' will create rows up
     to `net_buffer_length' length. If you increase this variable, you
     should also ensure that the `max_allowed_packet' variable in the
     MySQL server is bigger than the `net_buffer_length'.

The most normal use of `mysqldump' is probably for making a backup of
whole databases. *Note Backup::.

     mysqldump --opt database > backup-file.sql

You can read this back into MySQL with:

     mysql database < backup-file.sql

or

     mysql -e "source /patch-to-backup/backup-file.sql" database

However, it's also very useful to populate another MySQL server with
information from a database:

     mysqldump --opt database | mysql ---host=remote-host -C database

It is possible to dump several databases with one command:

     mysqldump --databases database1 [database2 database3...] > my_databases.sql

If all the databases are wanted, one can use:

     mysqldump --all-databases > all_databases.sql

mysqlhotcopy, Copying MySQL Databases and Tables
------------------------------------------------

`mysqlhotcopy' is a perl script that uses `LOCK TABLES', `FLUSH TABLES'
and `cp' or `scp' to quickly make a backup of a database.  It's the
fastest way to make a backup of the database, of single tables but it
can only be run on the same machine where the database directories are.

     mysqlhotcopy db_name [/path/to/new_directory]
     
     mysqlhotcopy db_name_1 ... db_name_n /path/to/new_directory
     
     mysqlhotcopy db_name./regex/

`mysqlhotcopy' supports the following options:

`-?, --help'
     Display a help screen and exit

`-u, --user=#'
     User for database login

`-p, --password=#'
     Password to use when connecting to server

`-P, --port=#'
     Port to use when connecting to local server

`-S, --socket=#'
     Socket to use when connecting to local server

`--allowold'
     Don't abort if target already exists (rename it _old)

`--keepold'
     Don't delete previous (now renamed) target when done

`--noindices'
     Don't include full index files in copy to make the backup smaller
     and faster The indexes can later be reconstructed with `myisamchk
     -rq.'.

`--method=#'
     Method for copy (`cp' or `scp').

`-q, --quiet'
     Be silent except for errors

`--debug'
     Enable debug

`-n, --dryrun'
     Report actions without doing them

`--regexp=#'
     Copy all databases with names matching regexp

`--suffix=#'
     Suffix for names of copied databases

`--checkpoint=#'
     Insert checkpoint entry into specified db.table

`--flushlog'
     Flush logs once all tables are locked.

`--tmpdir=#'
     Temporary directory (instead of /tmp).

You can use `perldoc mysqlhotcopy' to get a more complete documentation
for `mysqlhotcopy'.

`mysqlhotcopy' reads the groups `[client]' and  `[mysqlhotcopy]' from
the option files.

To be able to execute `mysqlhotcopy' you need write access to the
backup directory, `SELECT' privilege to the tables you are about to
copy and the MySQL `Reload' privilege (to be able to execute `FLUSH
TABLES').

mysqlimport, Importing Data from Text Files
-------------------------------------------

`mysqlimport' provides a command-line interface to the `LOAD DATA
INFILE' SQL statement.  Most options to `mysqlimport' correspond
directly to the same options to `LOAD DATA INFILE'.  *Note `LOAD DATA':
LOAD DATA.

`mysqlimport' is invoked like this:

     shell> mysqlimport [options] database textfile1 [textfile2....]

For each text file named on the command line, `mysqlimport' strips any
extension from the filename and uses the result to determine which
table to import the file's contents into.  For example, files named
`patient.txt', `patient.text', and `patient' would all be imported into
a table named `patient'.

`mysqlimport' supports the following options:

`-c, --columns=...'
     This option takes a comma-separated list of field names as an
     argument.  The field list is used to create a proper `LOAD DATA
     INFILE' command, which is then passed to MySQL. *Note `LOAD DATA':
     LOAD DATA.

`-C, --compress'
     Compress all information between the client and the server if both
     support compression.

`-#, --debug[=option_string]'
     Trace usage of the program (for debugging).

`-d, --delete'
     Empty the table before importing the text file.

`--fields-terminated-by=...'
`--fields-enclosed-by=...'
`--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...'
`--fields-escaped-by=...'
`--lines-terminated-by=...'
     These options have the same meaning as the corresponding clauses
     for `LOAD DATA INFILE'. *Note `LOAD DATA': LOAD DATA.

`-f, --force'
     Ignore errors.  For example, if a table for a text file doesn't
     exist, continue processing any remaining files.  Without `--force',
     `mysqlimport' exits if a table doesn't exist.

`--help'
     Display a help message and exit.

`-h host_name, --host=host_name'
     Import data to the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
     is `localhost'.

`-i, --ignore'
     See the description for the `--replace' option.

`-l, --lock-tables'
     Lock *ALL* tables for writing before processing any text files.
     This ensures that all tables are synchronized on the server.

`-L, --local'
     Read input files from the client.  By default, text files are
     assumed to be on the server if you connect to `localhost' (which
     is the default host).

`-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]'
     The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
     no `=your_pass' part, `mysqlimport' you will be prompted for a
     password.

`-P port_num, --port=port_num'
     The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a host.  (This is
     used for connections to hosts other than `localhost', for which
     Unix sockets are used.)

`-r, --replace'
     The `--replace' and `--ignore' options control handling of input
     records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If
     you specify `--replace', new rows replace existing rows that have
     the same unique key value. If you specify `--ignore', input rows
     that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are skipped.
     If you don't specify either option, an error occurs when a
     duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is
     ignored.

`-s, --silent'
     Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

`-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket'
     The socket file to use when connecting to `localhost' (which is the
     default host).

`-u user_name, --user=user_name'
     The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
     default value is your Unix login name.

`-v, --verbose'
     Verbose mode.  Print out more information what the program does.

`-V, --version'
     Print version information and exit.

Here is a sample run using `mysqlimport':

     $ mysql --version

Showing Databases, Tables, and Columns
--------------------------------------

`mysqlshow' can be used to quickly look at which databases exist, their
tables, and the table's columns.

With the `mysql' program you can get the same information with the
`SHOW' commands.  *Note SHOW::.

`mysqlshow' is invoked like this:

     shell> mysqlshow [OPTIONS] [database [table [column]]]

   * If no database is given, all matching databases are shown.

   * If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are
     shown.

   * If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in
     the table are shown.

Note that in newer MySQL versions, you only see those
database/tables/columns for which you have some privileges.

If the last argument contains a shell or SQL wild-card (`*', `?', `%'
or `_') then only what's matched by the wild card is shown.  This may
cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for a table
with a `_' as in this case `mysqlshow' only shows you the table names
that match the pattern.  This is easily fixed by adding an extra `%'
last on the command line (as a separate argument).

perror, Explaining Error Codes
------------------------------

`perror' can be used to print error message(s). `perror' can be invoked
like this:

     shell> perror [OPTIONS] [ERRORCODE [ERRORCODE...]]
     
     For example:
     
     shell> perror 64 79
     Error code  64:  Machine is not on the network
     Error code  79:  Can not access a needed shared library

`perror' can be used to display a description for a system error code,
or an MyISAM/ISAM table handler error code. The error messages are
mostly system dependent.

How to Run SQL Commands from a Text File
----------------------------------------

The `mysql' client typically is used interactively, like this:

     shell> mysql database

However, it's also possible to put your SQL commands in a file and tell
`mysql' to read its input from that file.  To do so, create a text file
`text_file' that contains the commands you wish to execute.  Then
invoke `mysql' as shown below:

     shell> mysql database < text_file

You can also start your text file with a `USE db_name' statement.  In
this case, it is unnecessary to specify the database name on the command
line:

     shell> mysql < text_file

*Note Client-Side Scripts::.

The MySQL Log Files
===================

MySQL has several different log files that can help you find out what's
going on inside `mysqld':

The error log          Problems encountering starting, running or
                       stopping `mysqld'.
The isam log           Logs all changes to the ISAM tables. Used only
                       for debugging the isam code.
The query log          Established connections and executed queries.
The update log         Deprecated: Stores all statements that changes
                       data
The binary log         Stores all statements that changes something.
                       Used also for replication
The slow log           Stores all queries that took more than
                       `long_query_time' to execute or didn't use
                       indexes.

All logs can be found in the `mysqld' data directory.  You can force
`mysqld' to reopen the log files (or in some cases switch to a new log)
by executing `FLUSH LOGS'. *Note FLUSH::.

* Menu:

* Error log::                   The Error Log

File: mysql.info,  Node: Error log,  Next: Query log,  Prev: Log Files,  Up: Log Files

The Error Log
-------------

`mysqld' writes all errors to the stderr, which the `safe_mysqld'
script redirects to a file called `'hostname'.err'.  (On Windows,
`mysqld' writes this directly to `\mysql\data\mysql.err').

This contains information indicating when `mysqld' was started and
stopped and also any critical errors found when running.  If `mysqld'
dies unexpectedly and `safe_mysqld' needs to restart `mysqld',
`safe_mysqld' will write a `restarted mysqld' row in this file.  This
log also holds a warning if `mysqld' notices a table that needs to be
automatically checked or repaired.

On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace for
where `mysqld' died. This can be used to find out where `mysqld' died.
*Note Using stack trace::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Query log,  Next: Update log,  Prev: Error log,  Up: Log Files

The General Query Log
---------------------

If you want to know what happens within `mysqld', you should start it
with `--log[=file]'.  This will log all connections and queries to the
log file (by default named `'hostname'.log').  This log can be very
useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know exactly
what `mysqld' thought the client sent to it.

By default, the `mysql.server' script starts the MySQL server with the
`-l' option.  If you need better performance when you start using MySQL
in a production environment, you can remove the `-l' option from
`mysql.server' or change it to `--log-bin'.

The entries in this log are written as `mysqld' receives the questions.
This may be different than the order in which the statements are
executed.  This is in contrast to the update log and the binary log
which are written after the query is executed, but before any locks are
released.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Update log,  Next: Binary log,  Prev: Query log,  Up: Log Files

The Update Log
--------------

*NOTE*: The update log is replaced by the binary log. *Note Binary
log::.  With this you can do anything that you can do with the update
log.

When started with the `--log-update[=file_name]' option, `mysqld'
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no
filename is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine. If a
filename is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the file is written
in the data directory. If `file_name' doesn't have an extension,
`mysqld' will create log file names like so: `file_name.###', where
`###' is a number that is incremented each time you execute `mysqladmin
refresh', execute `mysqladmin flush-logs', execute the `FLUSH LOGS'
statement, or restart the server.

*NOTE:* For the above scheme to work, you should NOT create your own
files with the same filename as the update log + some extensions that
may be regarded as a number, in the directory used by the update log!

If you use the `--log' or `-l' options, `mysqld' writes a general log
with a filename of `hostname.log', and restarts and refreshes do not
cause a new log file to be generated (although it is closed and
reopened). In this case you can copy it (on Unix) by doing:

     mv hostname.log hostname-old.log
     mysqladmin flush-logs
     cp hostname-old.log to-backup-directory
     rm hostname-old.log

Update logging is smart because it logs only statements that really
update data. So an `UPDATE' or a `DELETE' with a `WHERE' that finds no
rows is not written to the log. It even skips `UPDATE' statements that
set a column to the value it already has.

The update logging is done immediately after a query completes but
before any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that
the log will be logged in the execution order.

If you want to update a database from update log files, you could do the
following (assuming your update logs have names of the form
`file_name.###'):

     shell> ls -1 -t -r file_name.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql

`ls' is used to get all the log files in the right order.

This can be useful if you have to revert to backup files after a crash
and you want to redo the updates that occurred between the time of the
backup and the crash.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Binary log,  Next: Slow query log,  Prev: Update log,  Up: Log Files

The Binary Update Log
---------------------

The intention is that the binary log should replace the update log, so
we recommend you to switch to this log format as soon as possible!

The binary log contains all information that is available in the update
log in a more efficient format. It also contains information about how
long every query that updated the database took.

The binary log is also used when you are replicating a slave from a
master.  *Note Replication::.

When started with the `--log-bin[=file_name]' option, `mysqld' writes a
log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no file name
is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine followed by
`-bin'. If file name is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the file
is written in the data directory.

If you supply an extension to `--log-bin=filename.extension', the
extension will be silenty removed.

To the binary log filename `mysqld' will append an extension that is a
number that is incremented each time you execute `mysqladmin refresh',
execute `mysqladmin flush-logs', execute the `FLUSH LOGS' statement or
restart the server.

You can use the following options to `mysqld' to affect what is logged
to the binary log:

`binlog-do-db=database_name'   Tells the master it should log updates
                              for the specified database, and exclude
                              all others not explicitly mentioned.
                              (Example: `binlog-do-db=some_database')
`binlog-ignore-db=database_name' Tells the master that updates to the
                              given database should not be logged to the
                              binary log (Example:
                              `binlog-ignore-db=some_database')

To be able to know which different binary log files have been used,
`mysqld' will also create a binary log index file that contains the
name of all used binary log files. By default this has the same name as
the binary log file, with the extension `'.index''.  You can change the
name of the binary log index file with the `--log-bin-index=[filename]'
option.

If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files until you are sure that no slave will ever need to use them.  One
way to do this is to do `mysqladmin flush-logs' once a day and then
remove any logs that are more than 3 days old.

You can examine the binary log file with the `mysqlbinlog' command.
For example, you can update a MySQL server from the binary log as
follows:

     mysqlbinlog log-file | mysql -h server_name

You can also use the `mysqlbinlog' program to read the binary log
directly from a remote MySQL server!

`mysqlbinlog --help' will give you more information of how to use this
program!

If you are using `BEGIN [WORK]' or `SET AUTOCOMMIT=0', you must use the
MySQL binary log for backups instead of the old update log.

The binary logging is done immediately after a query completes but
before any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that
the log will be logged in the execution order.

All updates (`UPDATE', `DELETE' or `INSERT') that change a
transactional table (like BDB tables) are cached until a `COMMIT'.  Any
updates to a non-transactional table are stored in the binary log at
once.  Every thread will, on start, allocate a buffer of
`binlog_cache_size' to buffer queries.  If a query is bigger than this,
the thread will open a temporary file to handle the bigger cache.  The
temporary file will be deleted when the thread ends.

The `max_binlog_cache_size' can be used to restrict the total size used
to cache a multi-transaction query.

If you are using the update or binary log, concurrent inserts will not
work together with `CREATE ... INSERT' and `INSERT ... SELECT'.  This
is to ensure that you can recreate an exact copy of your tables by
applying the log on a backup.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Slow query log,  Next: Log file maintenance,  Prev: Binary log,  Up: Log Files

The Slow Query Log
------------------

When started with the `--log-slow-queries[=file_name]' option, `mysqld'
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that took more than
`long_query_time' to execute. The time to get the initial table locks
are not counted as execution time.

The slow query log is logged after the query is executed and after all
locks has been released. This may be different than the order in which
the statements are executed.

If no file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine
suffixed with `-slow.log'. If a filename is given, but doesn't contain
a path, the file is written in the data directory.

The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to
execute and are thus candidates for optimization. With a large log, that
can become a difficult task. You can pipe the slow query log through the
`mysqldumpslow' command to get a summary of the queries which appear in
the log.

You are using `--log-long-format' then also queries that are not using
indexes are printed. *Note Command-line options::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Log file maintenance,  Prev: Slow query log,  Up: Log Files

Log File Maintenance
--------------------

MySQL has a lot of log files which make it easy to see what is going.
*Note Log Files::. One must however from time to time clean up after
`MysQL' to ensure that the logs don't take up too much disk space.

When using MySQL with log files, you will, from time to time, want to
remove/backup old log files and tell MySQL to start logging on new
files.  *Note Backup::.

On a Linux (`Redhat') installation, you can use the `mysql-log-rotate'
script for this. If you installed MySQL from an RPM distribution, the
script should have been installed automatically.  Note that you should
be careful with this if you are using the log for replication!

On other systems you must install a short script yourself that you
start from `cron' to handle log files.

You can force MySQL to start using new log files by using `mysqladmin
flush-logs' or by using the SQL command `FLUSH LOGS'.  If you are using
MySQL Version 3.21 you must use `mysqladmin refresh'.

The above command does the following:

   * If standard logging (`--log') or slow query logging
     (`--log-slow-queries') is used, closes and reopens the log file.
     (`mysql.log' and ``hostname`-slow.log' as default).

   * If update logging (`--log-update') is used, closes the update log
     and opens a new log file with a higher sequence number.

If you are using only an update log, you only have to flush the logs
and then move away the old update log files to a backup.  If you are
using the normal logging, you can do something like:

     shell> cd mysql-data-directory
     shell> mv mysql.log mysql.old
     shell> mysqladmin flush-logs

and then take a backup and remove `mysql.old'.

descriptions of problems and how to solve them.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Replication Intro,  Next: Replication Implementation,  Prev: Replication,  Up: Replication

Introduction
------------

One way replication can be used is to increase both robustness and
speed. For robustness you can have two systems and can switch to the
backup if you have problems with the master. The extra speed is
achieved by sending a part of the non-updating queries to the replica
server. Of course this only works if non-updating queries dominate, but
that is the normal case.

Starting in Version 3.23.15, MySQL supports one-way replication
internally. One server acts as the master, while the other acts as the
slave. Note that one server could play the roles of master in one pair
and slave in the other. The master server keeps a binary log of updates
(*Note Binary log::.) and an index file to binary logs to keep track of
log rotation.  The slave, upon connecting, informs the master where it
left off since the last successfully propagated update, catches up on
the updates, and then blocks and waits for the master to notify it of
the new updates.

Note that if you are replicating a database, all updates to this
database should be done through the master!

Another benefit of using replication is that one can get live backups of
the system by doing a backup on a slave instead of doing it on the
master. *Note Backup::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Replication Implementation,  Next: Replication HOWTO,  Prev: Replication Intro,  Up: Replication

Replication Implementation Overview
-----------------------------------

MySQL replication is based on the server keeping track of all changes
to your database (updates, deletes, etc) in the binary log. (*Note
Binary log::.) and the slave server(s) reading the saved queries from
the master server's binary log so that the slave can execute the same
queries on its copy of the data.

It is *very important* to realize that the binary log is simply a
record starting from a fixed point in time (the moment you enable binary
logging). Any slaves which you set up will need copies of all the data
from your master as it existed the moment that you enabled binary
logging on the master. If you start your slaves with data that doesn't
agree with what was on the master *when the binary log was started*,
your slaves may fail.

A future version (4.0) of MySQL will remove the need to keep a
(possibly large) snapshot of data for new slaves that you might wish to
set up through the live backup functionality with no locking required.
However, at this time, it is necessary to block all writes either with a
global read lock or by shutting down the master while taking a snapshot.

Once a slave is properly configured and running, it will simply connect
to the master and wait for updates to process. If the master goes away
or the slave loses connectivity with your master, it will keep trying to
connect every `master-connect-retry' seconds until it is able to
reconnect and resume listening for updates.

Each slave keeps track of where it left off. The master server has no
knowledge of how many slaves there are or which ones are up-to-date at
any given time.

The next section explains the master/slave setup process in more detail.

How To Set Up Replication
-------------------------

Below is a quick description of how to set up complete replication on
your current MySQL server. It assumes you want to replicate all your
databases and have not configured replication before. You will need to
shutdown your master server briefly to complete the steps outlined
below.

  1. Make sure you have a recent version of MySQL installed on the
     master and slave(s).

     Use Version 3.23.29 or higher. Previous releases used a different
     binary log format and had bugs which have been fixed in newer
     releases. Please, do not report bugs until you have verified that
     the problem is present in the latest release.

  2. Set up special a replication user on the master with the `FILE'
     privilege and permission to connect from all the slaves. If the
     user is only doing replication (which is recommended), you don't
     need to grant any additional privileges.

     For example, to create a user named `repl' which can access your
     master from any host, you might use this command:

          GRANT FILE ON *.* TO repl@"%" IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

  3. Shut down MySQL on the master.

          mysqladmin -u root -p<password> shutdown

  4. Snapshot all the data on your master server.

     The easiest way to do this (on Unix) is to simply use *tar* to
     produce an archive of your entire data directory. The exact data
     directory location depends on your installation.

          tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar /path/to/data-dir

     Windows users can use WinZip or similar software to create an
     archive of the data directory.

  5. In `my.cnf' on the master add `log-bin' and `server-id=unique
     number' to the `[mysqld]' section and restart it. It is very
     important that the id of the slave is different from the id of the
     master. Think of `server-id' as something similar to the IP
     address - it uniquely identifies the server instance in the

          [mysqld]
          log-bin
          server-id=1

  6. Restart MySQL on the master.

  7. Add the following to `my.cnf' on the slave(s):

          master-host=<hostname of the master>
          master-user=<replication user name>
          master-password=<replication user password>
          master-port=<TCP/IP port for master>
          server-id=<some unique number between 2 and 2^32-1>

     replacing the values in <> with what is relevant to your system.

     `server-id' must be different for each server participating in
     replication.  If you don't specify a server-id, it will be set to
     1 if you have not defined `master-host', else it will be set to 2.
     Note that in the case of `server-id' omission the master will
     refuse connections from all slaves, and the slave will refuse to
     connect to a master. Thus, omitting `server-id' is only good for
     backup with a binary log.

  8. Copy the snapshot data into your data directory on your slave(s).
     Make sure that the privileges on the files and directories are
     correct. The user which MySQL runs as needs to be able to read and
     write to them, just as on the master.

  9. Restart the slave(s).


After you have done the above, the slave(s) should connect to the master
and catch up on any updates which happened since the snapshot was taken.

If you have forgotten to set `server-id' for the slave you will get the
following error in the error log file:

     Warning: one should set server_id to a non-0 value if master_host is set.
     The server will not act as a slave.

If you have forgot to do this for the master, the slaves will not be
able to connect to the master.

If a slave is not able to replicate for any reason, you will find error
messages in the error log on the slave.

Once a slave is replicating, you will find a file called `master.info'
in the same directory as your error log. The `master.info' file is used
by the slave to keep track of how much of the master's binary log is
has processed. *Do not* remove or edit the file, unless you really know
what you are doing. Even in that case, it is preferred that you use
`CHANGE MASTER TO' command.

Replication Features and Known Problems
---------------------------------------

Below is an explanation of what is supported and what is not:

   * Replication will be done correctly with `AUTO_INCREMENT',
     `LAST_INSERT_ID', and `TIMESTAMP' values.

   * `RAND()' in updates does not replicate properly. Use
     `RAND(some_non_rand_expr)' if you are replicating updates with
     `RAND()'. You can, for example, use `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()' for the
     argument to `RAND()'.

   * You have to use the same character set (`--default-character-set')
     on the master and the slave. If not, you may get duplicate key
     errors on the slave, because a key that is regarded as unique on
     the master may not be that in the other character set.

   * `LOAD DATA INFILE' will be handled properly as long as the file
     still resides on the master server at the time of update
     propagation. `LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE' will be skipped.

   * Update queries that use user variables are not replication-safe
     (yet).

   * `FLUSH' commands are not stored in the binary log and are because
     of this not replicated to the slaves. This is not normally a
     problem as `FLUSH' doesn't change anything. This does however mean
     that if you update the `MySQL' privilege tables directly without
     using `GRANT' statement and you replicate the `MySQL' privilege
     database, you must do a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES' on your slaves to put
     the new privileges into effect.

   * Temporary tables starting in 3.23.29 are replicated properly with
     the exception of the case when you shut down slave server ( not
     just slave thread), you have some temporary tables open, and the
     are used in subsequent updates.  To deal with this problem, to
     shut down the slave, do `SLAVE STOP', then check
     `Slave_open_temp_tables' variable to see if it is 0, then issue
     `mysqladmin shutdown'. If the number is not 0, restart the slave
     thread with `SLAVE START' and see if you have better luck next
     time. There will be a cleaner solution, but it has to wait until
     version 4.0.  In earlier versions temporary tables are not being
     replicated properly - we recommend that you either upgrade, or
     execute `SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0' on your clients before all queries
     with temp tables.

   * MySQL only supports one master and many slaves. We will in 4.x add
     a voting algorithm to automatically change master if something goes
     wrong with the current master. We will also introduce 'agent'
     processes to help doing load balancing by sending select queries
     to different slaves.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.26, it is safe to connect servers in a
     circular master-slave relationship with `log-slave-updates'
     enabled.  Note, however, that many queries will not work right in
     this kind of setup unless your client code is written to take care
     of the potential problems that can happen from updates that occur
     in different sequence on different servers.

     This means that you can do a setup like the following:

          A -> B -> C -> A

     This setup will only works if you only do non conflicting updates
     between the tables.  In other words, if you insert data in A and
     C, you should never insert a row in A that may have a conflicting
     key with a row insert in C.  You should also not update the sam
     rows on two servers if the order in which the updates are applied
     matters.

     Note that the log format has changed in Version 3.23.26 so that
     pre-3.23.26 slaves will not be able to read it.

   * If the query on the slave gets an error, the slave thread will
     terminate, and a message will appear in the `.err' file. You should
     then connect to the slave manually, fix the cause of the error (for
     example, non-existent table), and then run `SLAVE START' sql
     command (available starting in Version 3.23.16). In Version
     3.23.15, you will have to restart the server.

   * If connection to the master is lost, the slave will retry
     immediately, and then in case of failure every
     `master-connect-retry' (default 60) seconds. Because of this, it
     is safe to shut down the master, and then restart it after a
     while. The slave will also be able to deal with network
     connectivity outages.

   * Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track
     of where it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems,
     especially if disk cache was not synced before the system died.
     Your system fault tolerance will be greatly increased if you have
     a good UPS.

   * If the master is listening on a non-standard port, you will also
     need to specify this with `master-port' parameter in `my.cnf' .

   * In Version 3.23.15, all of the tables and databases will be
     replicated. Starting in Version 3.23.16, you can restrict
     replication to a set of databases with `replicate-do-db'
     directives in `my.cnf' or just exclude a set of databases with
     `replicate-ignore-db'. Note that up until Version 3.23.23, there
     was a bug that did not properly deal with `LOAD DATA INFILE' if
     you did it in a database that was excluded from replication.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.16, `SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 0' will turn off
     replication (binary) logging on the master, and `SET SQL_LOG_BIN =
     1' will turn in back on - you must have the process privilege to do
     this.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.19, you can clean up stale replication
     leftovers when something goes wrong and you want a clean start
     with `FLUSH MASTER' and `FLUSH SLAVE' commands. In Version 3.23.26
     we have renamed them to `RESET MASTER' and `RESET SLAVE'
     respectively to clarify what they do. The old `FLUSH' variants
     still work, though, for compatibility.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.21, you can use `LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER'
     for network backup and to set up replication initially. We have
     recently received a number of bug reports concerning it that we
     are investigating, so we recommend that you use it only in testing
     until we make it more stable.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.23, you can change masters and adjust log
     position with `CHANGE MASTER TO'.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.23, you tell the master that updates in
     certain databases should not be logged to the binary log with
     `binlog-ignore-db'.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.26, you can use `replicate-rewrite-db' to
     tell the slave to apply updates from one database on the master to
     the one with a different name on the slave.

   * Starting in Version 3.23.28, you can use `PURGE MASTER LOGS TO
     'log-name'' to get rid of old logs while the slave is running.

Replication Options in my.cnf
-----------------------------

If you are using replication, we recommend you to use MySQL Version
3.23.30 or later. Older versions work, but they do have some bugs and
are missing some features.

On both master and slave you need to use the `server-id' option.  This
sets an unique replication id. You should pick a unique value in the
range between 1 to 2^32-1 for each master and slave.  Example:
`server-id=3'

The following table has the options you can use for the *MASTER*:

*Option*               *Description*
`log-bin=filename'      Write to a binary update log to the specified
                       location. Note that if you give it a parameter
                       with an extension (for example,
                       `log-bin=/mysql/logs/replication.log' ) versions
                       up to 3.23.24 will not work right during
                       replication if you do `FLUSH LOGS' . The problem
                       is fixed in Version 3.23.25. If you are using
                       this kind of log name, `FLUSH LOGS' will be
                       ignored on binlog. To clear the log, run `FLUSH
                       MASTER', and do not forget to run `FLUSH SLAVE'
                       on all slaves. In Version 3.23.26 and in later
                       versions you should use `RESET MASTER' and `RESET
                       SLAVE'
`log-bin-index=filename' Because the user could issue the `FLUSH LOGS'
                       command, we need to know which log is currently
                       active and which ones have been rotated out and
                       in what sequence. This information is stored in
                       the binary log index file.  The default is
                       `hostname`.index. You can use this option if you
                       want to be a rebel.
                       
                       Example: `log-bin-index=db.index'.
`sql-bin-update-same'   If set, setting `SQL_LOG_BIN' to a value will
                       automatically set `SQL_LOG_UPDATE' to the same
                       value and vice versa.
`binlog-do-db=database_name' Tells the master that it should log updates to
                       the binary log if the current database is
                       'database_name'. All others database are ignored.
                       Note that if you use this you should ensure that
                       you only do updates in the current database.
                       
                       Example: `binlog-do-db=some_database'.
`binlog-ignore-db=database_name' Tells the master that updates where the current
                       database is 'database_name' should not be stored
                       in the binary log.  Note that if you use this you
                       should ensure that you only do updates in the
                       current database.
                       
                       Example: `binlog-ignore-db=some_database'

The following table has the options you can use for the *SLAVE*:

*Option*               *Description*
`master-host=host'      Master hostname or IP address for replication.
                       If not set, the slave thread will not be started.
                       
                       Example: `master-host=db-master.mycompany.com'.
`master-user=username'  The user the slave thread will us for
                       authentication when connecting to the master. The
                       user must have `FILE' privilege. If the master
                       user is not set, user `test' is assumed.
                       
                       Example: `master-user=scott'.
`master-password=password' The password the slave thread will authenticate
                       with when connecting to the master. If not set,
                       an empty password is assumed.
                       
                       Example: `master-password=tiger'.
`master-port=portnumber' The port the master is listening on. If not set,
                       the compiled setting of `MYSQL_PORT' is assumed.
                       If you have not tinkered with `configure'
                       options, this should be 3306.
                       
                       Example: `master-port=3306'.
`master-connect-retry=seconds' The number of seconds the slave thread will
                       sleep before retrying to connect to the master in
                       case the master goes down or the connection is
                       lost.  Default is 60.
                       
                       Example: `master-connect-retry=60'.
`master-info-file=filename' The location of the file that remembers where we
                       left off on the master during the replication
                       process. The default is master.info in the data
                       directory.  Sasha: The only reason I see for ever
                       changing the default is the desire to be
                       rebelious.
                       
                       Example: `master-info-file=master.info'.
`replicate-do-table=db_name.table_name' Tells the slave thread to restrict replication
                       to the specified table.  To specify more than one
                       table, use the directive multiple times, once for
                       each table.  This will work for cross-database
                       updates, in contrast to `replicate-do-db'.
                       
                       Example: `replicate-do-table=some_db.some_table'.
`replicate-ignore-table=db_name.table_name' Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the
                       specified table. To specify more than one table
                       to ignore, use the directive multiple times, once
                       for each table. This will work for cross-datbase
                       updates, in contrast to `replicate-ignore-db'.
                       
                       Example:
                       `replicate-ignore-table=db_name.some_table'.
`replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.table_name' Tells the slave thread to restrict replication
                       to the tables that match the specified wildcard
                       pattern.  To specify more than one table, use the
                       directive multiple times, once for each table.
                       This will work for cross-database updates.
                       
                       Example: `replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%' will
                       replicate only updates to tables in all databases
                       that start with foo and whose table names start
                       with bar.
`replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.table_name' Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the
                       tables that match the given wild card pattern. To
                       specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                       directive multiple times, once for each table.
                       This will work for cross-database updates.
                       
                       Example: `replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%'
                       will not do updates to tables in databases that
                       start with foo and whose table names start with
                       bar.
`replicate-ignore-db=database_name' Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the
                       specified database. To specify more than one
                       database to ignore, use the directive multiple
                       times, once for each database. This option will
                       not work if you use cross database updates. If
                       you need cross database updates to work, make sure
                       you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                       `replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%'
                       
                       Example: `replicate-ignore-db=some_db'.
`replicate-do-db=database_name' Tells the slave thread to restrict replication
                       to the specified database.  To specify more than
                       one database, use the directive multiple times,
                       once for each database. Note that this will only
                       work if you do not use cross-database queries
                       such as `UPDATE some_db.some_table SET foo='bar''
                       while having selected a different or no database.
                       If you need cross database updates to work, make
                       sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                       `replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%'
                       
                       Example: `replicate-do-db=some_db'.
`log-slave-updates'     Tells the slave to log the updates from the
                       slave thread to the binary log. Off by default.
                       You will need to turn it on if you plan to
                       daisy-chain the slaves.
`replicate-rewrite-db=from_name->to_name' Updates to a database with a different name than
                       the original
                       
                       Example:
                       `replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name'.
`slave-skip-errors=err_code1,err_code2,..' Available only in 3.23.47 and later. Tells the
                       slave thread to continue replication when a query
                       returns an error from the provided list.
                       Normally, replication will discontinue when an
                       error is encountered giving the user a chance to
                       resolve the inconsistency in the data manually.
                       Do not use this option unless you fully
                       understand why you are getting the errors.  If
                       there are no bugs in your replication setup and
                       client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, you
                       should never get an abort with
                       error.Indiscriminate use of this option will
                       result in slaves being hopelessly out of sync
                       with the master and you having no idea how the
                       problem happened.
                       
                       For error codes, you should use the numbers
                       provided by the error message in your slave error
                       log and in the output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'.
                       Full list of error messages can be found in the
                       source distribution in `Docs/mysqld_error.txt'.
                       
                       You can ( but should not) also use a very
                       non-recommended value of `all' which will ignore
                       all error messages and keep barging along
                       regardless.  Needless to say, if you use it, we
                       make no promises regarding your data integrity.
                       Please do not complain if your data on the slave
                       is not anywhere close to what it is on the master
                       in this case - you have been warned.
                       
                       Example:
                       
                       `slave-skip-errors=1062,1053' or
                       `slave-skip-errors=all'
`skip-slave-start'      Tells the slave server not to start the slave on
                       the startup.  The user can start it later with
                       `SLAVE START'.
`slave_read_timeout=#'  Number of seconds to wait for more data from the
                       master before aborting the read.

SQL Commands Related to Replication
-----------------------------------

Replication can be controlled through the SQL interface. Below is the
summary of commands:

*Command*              *Description*
`SLAVE START'          Starts the slave thread. (Slave)
`SLAVE STOP'           Stops the slave thread. (Slave)
`SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0'    Disables update logging if the user has process
                       privilege.   Ignored otherwise. (Master)
`SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1'    Re-enables update logging if the user has process
                       privilege.   Ignored otherwise. (Master)
`SET                   Skip the next `n' events from the master. Only
SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n'valid when the slave thread is not running,
                       otherwise, gives an error. Useful for recovering
                       from replication glitches.
`RESET MASTER'         Deletes all binary logs listed in the index file,
                       resetting the binlog index file to be empty. In
                       pre-3.23.26 versions, `FLUSH MASTER' (Master)
`RESET SLAVE'          Makes the slave forget its replication position
                       in the master logs. In pre 3.23.26 versions the
                       command was called `FLUSH SLAVE'(Slave)
`LOAD TABLE tblname    Downloads a copy of the table from master to the
FROM MASTER'           slave. (Slave)
`CHANGE MASTER TO      Changes the master parameters to the values
master_def_list'       specified in `master_def_list' and restarts the
                       slave thread. `master_def_list' is a
                       comma-separated list of `master_def' where
                       `master_def' is one of the following:
                       `MASTER_HOST', `MASTER_USER', `MASTER_PASSWORD',
                       `MASTER_PORT', `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY',
                       `MASTER_LOG_FILE', `MASTER_LOG_POS'. Example:
                       
                       
                            CHANGE MASTER TO
                              MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',
                              MASTER_USER='replication',
                              MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
                              MASTER_PORT=3306,
                              MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
                              MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
                       You only need to specify the values that need to
                       be changed. The values that you omit will stay
                       the same with the exception of when you change
                       the host or the port. In that case, the slave
                       will assume that since you are connecting to a
                       different host or a different port, the master is
                       different. Therefore, the old values of log and
                       position are not applicable anymore, and will
                       automatically be reset to an empty string and 0,
                       respectively (the start values). Note that if you
                       restart the slave, it will remember its last
                       master.  If this is not desirable, you should
                       delete the `master.info' file before restarting,
                       and the slave will read its master from `my.cnf'
                       or the command line. (Slave)
`SHOW MASTER STATUS'   Provides status information on the binlog of the
                       master. (Master)
`SHOW SLAVE STATUS'    Provides status information on essential
                       parameters of the slave thread. (Slave)
`SHOW MASTER LOGS'     Only available starting in Version 3.23.28. Lists
                       the binary logs on the master. You should use
                       this command prior to `PURGE MASTER LOGS TO' to
                       find out how far you should go.
`PURGE MASTER LOGS TO  Available starting in Version 3.23.28. Deletes
'logname''             all the replication logs that are listed in the
                       log index as being prior to the specified log,
                       and removed them from the log index, so that the
                       given log now becomes first. Example:
                       
                            PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010'
                       This command will do nothing and fail with an
                       error if you have an active slave that is
                       currently reading one of the logs you are trying
                       to delete. However, if you have a dormant slave,
                       and happen to purge one of the logs it wants to
                       read, the slave will be unable to replicate once
                       it comes up.  The command is safe to run while
                       slaves are replicating - you do not need to stop
                       them.
                       
                       You must first check all the slaves with `SHOW
                       SLAVE STATUS' to see which log they are on, then
                       do a listing of the logs on the master with `SHOW
                       MASTER LOGS', find the earliest log among all the
                       slaves (if all the slaves are up to date, this
                       will be the last log on the list), backup all the
                       logs you are about to delete (optional) and purge
                       up to the target log.

Replication FAQ
---------------

*Q*: Why do I sometimes see more than one `Binlog_Dump' thread on the
master after I have restarted the slave?

*A*: `Binlog_Dump' is a continuous process that is handled by the
server in the following way:

   * Catch up on the updates.

   * Once there are no more updates left, go into `pthread_cond_wait()',
     from which we can be awakened either by an update or a kill.

   * On wake up, check the reason. If we are not supposed to die,
     continue the `Binlog_dump' loop.

   * If there is some fatal error, such as detecting a dead client,
     terminate the loop.

So if the slave thread stops on the slave, the corresponding
`Binlog_Dump' thread on the master will not notice it until after at
least one update to the master (or a kill), which is needed to wake it
up from `pthread_cond_wait()'.  In the meantime, the slave could have
opened another connection, which resulted in another `Binlog_Dump'
thread.

The above problem should not be present in Version 3.23.26 and later
versions.  In Version 3.23.26 we added `server-id' to each replication
server, and now all the old zombie threads are killed on the master
when a new replication thread connects from the same slave

*Q*: How do I rotate replication logs?

*A*: In Version 3.23.28 you should use `PURGE MASTER LOGS TO' command
after determining which logs can be deleted, and optionally backing
them up first. In earlier versions the process is much more painful,
and cannot be safely done without stopping all the slaves in the case
that you plan to re-use log names. You will need to stop the slave
threads, edit the binary log index file, delete all the old logs,
restart the master, start slave threads, and then remove the old log
files.

*Q*: How do I upgrade on a hot replication setup?

*A*: If you are upgrading  pre-3.23.26 versions, you should just lock
the master tables, let the slave catch up, then run `FLUSH MASTER' on
the master, and `FLUSH SLAVE' on the slave to reset the logs, then
restart new versions of the master and the slave. Note that the slave
can stay down for some time - since the master is logging all the
updates, the slave will be able to catch up once it is up and can
connect.

After 3.23.26, we have locked the replication protocol for
modifications, so you can upgrade masters and slave on the fly to a
newer 3.23 version and you can have different versions of MySQL running
on the slave and the master, as long as they are both newer than
3.23.26.

*Q*: What issues should I be aware of when setting up two-way
replication?

*A*: MySQL replication currently does not support any locking protocol
between master and slave to guarantee the atomicity of a distributed
(cross-server) update. In in other words, it is possible for client A
to make an update to  co-master 1, and in the meantime, before it
propagates to co-master 2, client B could make an update to co-master 2
that will make the update of client A work differently than it did on
co-master 1. Thus when the update of client A will make it to co-master
2, it will produce  tables that will be different than what you have on
co-master 1, even after all the updates from co-master 2 have also
propagated. So you should not co-chain two servers in a two-way
replication relationship, unless you are sure that you updates can
safely happen in any order, or unless you take care of mis-ordered
updates somehow in the client code.

You must also realize that two-way replication actually does not improve
performance very much, if at all, as far as updates are concerned. Both
servers need to do the same amount of updates each, as you would have
one server do. The only difference is that there will be a little less
lock contention, because the updates originating on another server will
be serialized in one slave thread. This benefit, though, might be
offset by network delays.

*Q*: How can I use replication to improve performance of my system?

*A*: You should set up one server as the master, and direct all writes
to it, and configure as many slaves as you have the money and rackspace
for, distributing the reads among the master and the slaves.  You can
also start the slaves with `--skip-bdb', `--low-priority-updates' and
`--delay-key-write-for-all-tables' to get speed improvements for the
slave.  In this case the slave will use non-transactional `MyISAM'
tables instead of `BDB' tables to get more speed.

*Q*: What should I do to prepare my client code to use
performance-enhancing replication?

*A*: If the part of your code that is responsible for database access
has been properly abstracted/modularized, converting it to run with the
replicated setup should be very smooth and easy - just change the
implementation of your database access to read from some slave or the
master, and to always write to the master. If your code does not have
this level of abstraction, setting up a replicated system will give you
an opportunity/motivation to it clean up.   You should start by
creating a wrapper library /module with the following functions:

   * `safe_writer_connect()'

   * `safe_reader_connect()'

   * `safe_reader_query()'

   * `safe_writer_query()'

`safe_' means that the function will take care of handling all the
error conditions.

You should then convert your client code to use the wrapper library.
It may be a painful and scary process at first, but it will pay off in
the long run. All applications that follow the above pattern will be
able to take advantage of one-master/many slaves solution.  The code
will be a lot easier to maintain, and adding troubleshooting options
will be trivial. You will just need to modify one or two functions, for
example, to log how long each query took, or which query, among your
many thousands, gave you an error. If you have written a lot of code
already, you may want to automate the conversion task by using Monty's
`replace' utility, which comes with the standard distribution of MySQL,
or just write your own Perl script. Hopefully, your code follows some
recognizable pattern. If not, then you are probably better off
re-writing it anyway, or at least going through and manually beating it
into a pattern.

Note that, of course, you can use different names for the functions.
What is important is having unified interface for connecting for reads,
connecting for writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

*Q*: When and how much can MySQL replication improve the performance of
my system?

*A*: MySQL replication is most beneficial for a system with frequent
reads and not so frequent writes. In theory, by using a one master/many
slaves setup you can scale by adding more slaves until you either run
out of network bandwidth, or your update load grows to the point that
the master cannot handle it.

In order to determine how many slaves you can get before the added
benefits begin to level out, and how much you can improve performance
of your site, you need to know your query patterns, and empirically
(by benchmarking) determine the relationship between the throughput on
reads (reads per second, or `max_reads') and on writes `max_writes') on
a typical master and a typical slave. The example below will show you a
rather simplified calculation of what you can get with replication for
our imagined system.

Let's say our system load consists of 10% writes and 90% reads, and we
have determined that `max_reads' = 1200 - 2 * `max_writes', or in other
words, our system can do 1200 reads per second with no writes, our
average write is twice as slow as average read, and the relationship is
linear. Let us suppose that our master and slave are of the same
capacity, and we have N slaves and 1 master. Then we have for each
server (master or slave):

`reads = 1200 - 2 * writes' (from bencmarks)

`reads = 9* writes / (N + 1) ' (reads split, but writes go to all
servers)

`9*writes/(N+1) + 2 * writes = 1200'

`writes = 1200/(2 + 9/(N+1)'

So if N = 0, which means we have no replication, our system can handle
1200/11, about 109 writes per second (which means we will have 9 times
as many reads due to the nature of our application).

If N = 1, we can get up to 184 writes per second.

If N = 8, we get up to 400.

If N = 17, 480 writes.

Eventually as N approaches infinity (and our budget negative infinity),
we can get very close to 600 writes per second, increasing system
throughput about 5.5 times. However, with only 8 servers, we increased
it almost 4 times already.

Note that our computations assumed infinite network bandwidth, and
neglected several other factors that could turn out to be significant on
your system. In many cases, you may not be able to make a computation
similar to the one above that will accurately predict what will happen
on your system if you add N replication slaves. However, answering the
following questions should help you decided whether and how much, if at
all, the replication will improve the performance of your system:

   * What is the read/write ratio on your system?

   * How much more write load can one server handle if you reduce the
     reads?

   * How many slaves do you have bandwidth for on your network?

*Q*: How can I use replication to provide redundancy/high availability?

*A*: With the currently available features, you would have to set up a
master and a slave (or several slaves), and write a script that will
monitor the master to see if it is up, and instruct your applications
and the slaves of the master change in case of failure. Some
suggestions:

   * To tell a slave to change the master use the `CHANGE MASTER TO'
     command.

   * A good way to keep your applications informed where the master is
     by having a dynamic DNS entry for the master. With *bind* you can
     use `nsupdate' to dynamically update your DNS.

   * You should run your slaves with the `log-bin' option and without
     `log-slave-updates'. This way the slave will be ready to become a
     master as soon as you issue `STOP SLAVE'; `RESET MASTER', and
     `CHANGE MASTER TO' on the other slaves. It will also help you catch
     spurious updates that may happen because of misconfiguration of the
     slave (ideally, you want to configure access rights so that no
     client can update the slave, except for the slave thread) combined
     with the bugs in your client programs (they should never update
     the slave directly).


We are currently working on integrating an automatic master election
system into MySQL, but until it is ready, you will have to create your
own monitoring tools.

Troubleshooting Replication
---------------------------

If you have followed the instructions, and your replication setup is not
working, first eliminate the user error factor by checking the
following:

   * Is the master logging to the binary log? Check with `SHOW MASTER
     STATUS'.  If it is, `Position' will be non-zero. If not, verify
     that you have given the master `log-bin' option and have set
     `server-id'.

   * Is the slave running? Check with `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'. The answer
     is found in `Slave_running' column. If not, verify slave options
     and check the error log for messages.

   * If the slave is running, did it establish connection with the
     master? Do `SHOW PROCESSLIST', find the thread with `system user'
     value in `User' column and `none' in the `Host' column, and check
     the `State' column. If it says `connecting to master', verify the
     privileges for the replication user on the master, master host
     name, your DNS setup, whether the master is actually running,
     whether it is reachable from the slave, and if all that seems ok,
     read the error logs.

   * If the slave was running, but then stopped, look at SHOW SLAVE
     STATUS output and check the error logs. It usually happens when
     some query that succeeded on the master fails on the slave. This
     should never happen if you have taken a proper snapshot of the
     master, and never modify the data on the slave outside of the
     slave thread. If it does, it is a bug, read below on how to report
     it.

   * If a query on that succeeded on the master refuses to run on the
     slave, and a full database resync ( the proper thing to do ) does
     not seem feasible, try the following:
        - First see if there is some stray record in the way.
          Understand how it got there, then delete it and run `SLAVE
          START'

        - If the above does not work or does not apply, try to
          understand if it would be safe to make the update manually (
          if needed) and then ignore the next query from the master.

        - If you have decided you can skip the next query, do `SET
          SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START;' to skip a query that
          does not use auto_increment, or last_insert_id  or `SET
          SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=2; SLAVE START;' otherwise. The reason
          auto_increment/last_insert_id queries are different is that
          they take two events in the binary log of the master.

        - If you are sure the slave started out perfectly in sync with
          the master, and no one has updated  the tables involved
          outside of slave thread, report the bug, so you will not have
          to do the above tricks again.

   * Make sure you are not running into an old bug by upgrading to the
     most recent version.

   * If all else fails, read the error logs. If they are big, `grep -i
     slave /path/to/your-log.err' on the slave. There is no generic
     pattern to search for on the master, as the only errors it logs
     are general system errors - if it can, it will send the error to
     the slave when things go wrong.

When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and
replication still either does not work at all or is unstable, it is
time to start working on a bug report. We need to get as much info as
possible from you to be able to track down the bug. Please do spend
some time and effort preparing a good bug report. Ideally, we would
like to have a test case in the format found in `mysql-test/t/rpl*'
directory of the source tree. If you submit a test case like that, you
can expect a patch within a day or two in most cases, although, of
course, you mileage may vary depending on a number of factors.

Second best option is a just program with easily configurable connection
arguments for the master and the slave that will demonstrate the
problem on our systems. You can write one in Perl or in C, depending on
which language you know better.

If you have one of the above ways to demonstrate the bug, use
`mysqlbug' to prepare a bug report and send it to
<bugs@lists.mysql.com>. If you have a phantom - a problem that does
occur but you cannot duplicate "at will":

   * Verify that there is no user error involved. For example, if you
     update the slave outside of the slave thread, the data will be out
     of sync, and you can have unique key violations on updates, in
     which case the slave thread will stop and wait for you to clean up
     the tables manually to bring them in sync.

   * Run slave with `log-slave-updates' and `log-bin' - this will keep
     a log of all updates on the slave.

   * Save all evidence before resetting the replication. If we have no
     or only sketchy information, it would take us a while to track
     down the problem. The evidence you should collect is:
        - All binary logs on the master

        - All binary log on the slave

        - The output of `SHOW MASTER STATUS' on the master at the time
          you have discovered the problem

        - The output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' on the master at the time
          you have discovered the problem

        - Error logs on the master and on the slave

   * Use `mysqlbinlog' to examine the binary logs. The following should
     be helpful to find the trouble query, for example:
          mysqlbinlog -j pos_from_slave_status /path/to/log_from_slave_status | head

Once you have collected the evidence on the phantom problem, try hard to
isolate it into a separate test case first. Then report the problem to
<bugs@lists.mysql.com> with as much info as possible.

Optimization is a complicated task because it ultimately requires
understanding of the whole system. While it may be possible to do some
local optimizations with small knowledge of your system or application,
the more optimal you want your system to become the more you will have
to know about it.

This chapter will try to explain and give some examples of different
ways to optimize MySQL.  Remember, however, that there are always some
(increasingly harder) additional ways to make the system even faster.

Optimization Overview
=====================

The most important part for getting a system fast is of course the basic
design. You also need to know what kinds of things your system will be
doing, and what your bottlenecks are.

The most common bottlenecks are:
   * Disk seeks.  It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data.
     With modern disks in 1999, the mean time for this is usually lower
     than 10ms, so we can in theory do about 1000 seeks a second. This
     time improves slowly with new disks and is very hard to optimize
     for a single table. The way to optimize this is to spread the data
     on more than one disk.

   * Disk reading/writing.  When the disk is at the correct position we
     need to read the data. With modern disks in 1999, one disk
     delivers something like 10-20Mb/s. This is easier to optimize than
     seeks because you can read in parallel from multiple disks.

   * CPU cycles.  When we have the data in main memory (or if it
     already were there) we need to process it to get to our result.
     Having small tables compared to the memory is the most common
     limiting factor. But then, with small tables speed is usually not
     the problem.

   * Memory bandwidth.  When the CPU needs more data than can fit in
     the CPU cache the main memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This
     is an uncommon bottleneck for most systems, but one should be
     aware of it.

MySQL Design Limitations/Tradeoffs
----------------------------------

Because MySQL uses extremely fast table locking (multiple readers /
single writers) the biggest remaining problem is a mix of a steady
stream of inserts and slow selects on the same table.

We believe that for a huge number of systems the extremely fast
performance in other cases make this choice a win. This case is usually
also possible to solve by having multiple copies of the table, but it
takes more effort and hardware.

We are also working on some extensions to solve this problem for some
common application niches.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Portability,  Next: Internal use,  Prev: Design Limitations,  Up: Optimize Overview

Portability
-----------

Because all SQL servers implement different parts of SQL, it takes work
to write portable SQL applications. For very simple selects/inserts it
is very easy, but the more you need the harder it gets. If you want an
application that is fast with many databases it becomes even harder!

To make a complex application portable you need to choose a number of
SQL servers that it should work with.

You can use the MySQL crash-me program/web-page
`http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php' to find functions,
types, and limits you can use with a selection of database servers.
Crash-me now tests far from everything possible, but it is still
comprehensive with about 450 things tested.

For example, you shouldn't have column names longer than 18 characters
if you want to be able to use Informix or DB2.

Both the MySQL benchmarks and crash-me programs are very
database-independent.  By taking a look at how we have handled this, you
can get a feeling for what you have to do to write your application
database-independent.  The benchmarks themselves can be found in the
`sql-bench' directory in the MySQL source distribution. They are
written in Perl with DBI database interface (which solves the access
part of the problem).

See `http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html' for the results
from this benchmark.

As you can see in these results, all databases have some weak points.
That is, they have different design compromises that lead to different
behavior.

If you strive for database independence, you need to get a good feeling
for each SQL server's bottlenecks. MySQL is VERY fast in retrieving and
updating things, but will have a problem in mixing slow readers/writers
on the same table. Oracle, on the other hand, has a big problem when
you try to access rows that you have recently updated (until they are
flushed to disk). Transaction databases in general are not very good at
generating summary tables from log tables, as in this case row locking
is almost useless.

To get your application _really_ database-independent, you need to
define an easy extendable interface through which you manipulate your
data. As C++ is available on most systems, it makes sense to use a C++
classes interface to the databases.

If you use some specific feature for some database (like the `REPLACE'
command in MySQL), you should code a method for the other SQL servers
to implement the same feature (but slower).  With MySQL you can use the
`/*!  */' syntax to add MySQL-specific keywords to a query.  The code
inside `/**/' will be treated as a comment (ignored) by most other SQL
servers.

If REAL high performance is more important than exactness, as in some
Web applications, a possibility is to create an application layer that
caches all results to give you even higher performance. By letting old
results 'expire' after a while, you can keep the cache reasonably
fresh.  This is quite nice in case of extremely high load, in which case
you can dynamically increase the cache and set the expire timeout higher
until things get back to normal.

In this case the table creation information should contain information
of the initial size of the cache and how often the table should normally
be refreshed.

What Have We Used MySQL For?
----------------------------

During MySQL initial development, the features of MySQL were made to
fit our largest customer. They handle data warehousing for a couple of
the biggest retailers in Sweden.

From all stores, we get weekly summaries of all bonus card transactions,
and we are expected to provide useful information for the store owners
to help them find how their advertisement campaigns are affecting their
customers.

The data is quite huge (about 7 million summary transactions per month),
and we have data for 4-10 years that we need to present to the users.
We got weekly requests from the customers that they want to get
'instant' access to new reports from this data.

We solved this by storing all information per month in compressed
'transaction' tables. We have a set of simple macros (script) that
generates summary tables grouped by different criteria (product group,
customer id, store ...) from the transaction tables.  The reports are
Web pages that are dynamically generated by a small Perl script that
parses a Web page, executes the SQL statements in it, and inserts the
results. We would have used PHP or mod_perl instead but they were not
available at that time.

For graphical data we wrote a simple tool in `C' that can produce GIFs
based on the result of a SQL query (with some processing of the
result). This is also dynamically executed from the Perl script that
parses the `HTML' files.

In most cases a new report can simply be done by copying an existing
script and modifying the SQL query in it.  In some cases, we will need
to add more fields to an existing summary table or generate a new one,
but this is also quite simple, as we keep all transactions tables on
disk.  (Currently we have at least 50G of transactions tables and 200G
of other customer data.)

We also let our customers access the summary tables directly with ODBC
so that the advanced users can themselves experiment with the data.

We haven't had any problems handling this with quite modest Sun Ultra
SPARCstation (2x200 Mhz). We recently upgraded one of our servers to a 2
CPU 400 Mhz UltraSPARC, and we are now planning to start handling
transactions on the product level, which would mean a ten-fold increase
of data. We think we can keep up with this by just adding more disk to
our systems.

We are also experimenting with Intel-Linux to be able to get more CPU
power cheaper. Now that we have the binary portable database format (new
in Version 3.23), we will start to use this for some parts of the
application.

Our initial feelings are that Linux will perform much better on
low-to-medium load and Solaris will perform better when you start to
get a high load because of extreme disk IO, but we don't yet have
anything conclusive about this. After some discussion with a Linux
Kernel developer, this might be a side effect of Linux giving so much
resources to the batch job that the interactive performance gets very
low. This makes the machine feel very slow and unresponsive while big
batches are going. Hopefully this will be better handled in future
Linux Kernels.

The MySQL Benchmark Suite
-------------------------

This should contain a technical description of the MySQL benchmark
suite (and `crash-me'), but that description is not written yet.
Currently, you can get a good idea of the benchmark by looking at the
code and results in the `sql-bench' directory in any MySQL source
distributions.

This benchmark suite is meant to be a benchmark that will tell any user
what things a given SQL implementation performs well or poorly at.

Note that this benchmark is single threaded, so it measures the minimum
time for the operations. We plan to in the future add a lot of
multi-threaded tests to the benchmark suite.

For example, (run on the same NT 4.0 machine):

*Reading 2000000 rows by index* *Seconds*                                   *Seconds*

sybase_odbc                                 4802           


In the above test MySQL was run with a 8M index cache.

We have gather some more benchmark results at
`http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html'.

Note that Oracle is not included because they asked to be removed. All
Oracle benchmarks have to be passed by Oracle! We believe that makes
Oracle benchmarks *VERY* biased because the above benchmarks are
supposed to show what a standard installation can do for a single
client.

To run the benchmark suite, you have to download a MySQL source
distribution, install the perl DBI driver, the perl DBD driver for the
database you want to test and then do:

     cd sql-bench
     perl run-all-tests --server=#

where # is one of supported servers. You can get a list of all options
and supported servers by doing `run-all-tests --help'.

`crash-me' tries to determine what features a database supports and
what its capabilities and limitations are by actually running queries.
For example, it determines:

   * What column types are supported

   * How many indexes are supported

   * What functions are supported

   * How big a query can be

   * How big a `VARCHAR' column can be

We can find the result from crash-me on a lot of different databases at
`http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php'.

Using Your Own Benchmarks
-------------------------

You should definitely benchmark your application and database to find
out where the bottlenecks are.  By fixing it (or by replacing the
bottleneck with a 'dummy module') you can then easily identify the next
bottleneck (and so on).  Even if the overall performance for your
application is sufficient, you should at least make a plan for each
bottleneck, and decide how to solve it if someday you really need the
extra performance.

For an example of portable benchmark programs, look at the MySQL
benchmark suite. *Note MySQL Benchmarks: MySQL Benchmarks. You can take
any program from this suite and modify it for your needs. By doing
this, you can try different solutions to your problem and test which is
really the fastest solution for you.

It is very common that some problems only occur when the system is very
heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us when they
have a (tested) system in production and have encountered load
problems. In every one of these cases so far, it has been problems with
basic design (table scans are NOT good at high load) or OS/Library
issues. Most of this would be a *LOT* easier to fix if the systems were
not already in production.

To avoid problems like this, you should put some effort into
benchmarking your whole application under the worst possible load!  You
can use Super Smack for this, and it is available at:
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz'.
As the name suggests, it can bring your system down to its knees if you
ask it, so make sure to use it only on your development systems.

Optimizing `SELECT's and Other Queries
======================================

First, one thing that affects all queries: The more complex permission
system setup you have, the more overhead you get.

If you do not have any `GRANT' statements done, MySQL will optimize the
permission checking somewhat. So if you have a very high volume it may
be worth the time to avoid grants. Otherwise more permission check
results in a larger overhead.

If your problem is with some explicit MySQL function, you can always
time this in the MySQL client:

     mysql> select benchmark(1000000,1+1);
     +------------------------+
     | benchmark(1000000,1+1) |
     +------------------------+
     |                      0 |
     +------------------------+
     1 row in set (0.32 sec)

The above shows that MySQL can execute 1,000,000 `+' expressions in
0.32 seconds on a `PentiumII 400MHz'.

All MySQL functions should be very optimized, but there may be some
exceptions, and the `benchmark(loop_count,expression)' is a great tool
to find out if this is a problem with your query.

`EXPLAIN' Syntax (Get Information About a `SELECT')
---------------------------------------------------

         EXPLAIN tbl_name
     or  EXPLAIN SELECT select_options

`EXPLAIN tbl_name' is a synonym for `DESCRIBE tbl_name' or `SHOW
COLUMNS FROM tbl_name'.

When you precede a `SELECT' statement with the keyword `EXPLAIN', MySQL
explains how it would process the `SELECT', providing information about
how tables are joined and in which order.

With the help of `EXPLAIN', you can see when you must add indexes to
tables to get a faster `SELECT' that uses indexes to find the records.
You can also see if the optimizer joins the tables in an optimal order.
To force the optimizer to use a specific join order for a `SELECT'
statement, add a `STRAIGHT_JOIN' clause.

For non-simple joins, `EXPLAIN' returns a row of information for each
table used in the `SELECT' statement. The tables are listed in the order
they would be read.  MySQL resolves all joins using a single-sweep
multi-join method. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first
table, then finds a matching row in the second table, then in the third
table and so on. When all tables are processed, it outputs the selected
columns and backtracks through the table list until a table is found
for which there are more matching rows. The next row is read from this
table and the process continues with the next table.

Output from `EXPLAIN' includes the following columns:

`table'
     The table to which the row of output refers.

`type'
     The join type.  Information about the various types is given below.

`possible_keys'
     The `possible_keys' column indicates which indexes MySQL could use
     to find the rows in this table. Note that this column is totally
     independent of the order of the tables. That means that some of
     the keys in possible_keys may not be usable in practice with the
     generated table order.

     If this column is empty, there are no relevant indexes. In this
     case, you may be able to improve the performance of your query by
     examining the `WHERE' clause to see if it refers to some column or
     columns that would be suitable for indexing.  If so, create an
     appropriate index and check the query with `EXPLAIN' again. *Note
     ALTER TABLE::.

     To see what indexes a table has, use `SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name'.

`key'
     The `key' column indicates the key that MySQL actually decided to
     use. The key is `NULL' if no index was chosen.  If MySQL chooses
     the wrong index, you can probably force MySQL to use another index
     by using `myisamchk --analyze', *Note myisamchk syntax::, or by
     using `USE INDEX/IGNORE INDEX'.  *Note JOIN::.

`key_len'
     The `key_len' column indicates the length of the key that MySQL
     decided to use.  The length is `NULL' if the `key' is `NULL'. Note
     that this tells us how many parts of a multi-part key MySQL will
     actually use.

`ref'
     The `ref' column shows which columns or constants are used with the
     `key' to select rows from the table.

`rows'
     The `rows' column indicates the number of rows MySQL believes it
     must examine to execute the query.

`Extra'
     This column contains additional information of how MySQL will
     resolve the query. Here is an explanation of the different text
     strings that can be found in this column:

    `Distinct'
          MySQL will not continue searching for more rows for the
          current row combination after it has found the first matching
          row.

    `Not exists'
          MySQL was able to do a `LEFT JOIN' optimization on the query
          and will not examine more rows in this table for the previous
          row combination after it finds one row that matches the `LEFT
          JOIN' criteria.

          Here is an example for this:

               SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id WHERE t2.id IS NULL;

          Assume that `t2.id' is defined with `NOT NULL'.  In this case
          MySQL will scan `t1' and look up the rows in `t2' through
          `t1.id'. If MySQL finds a matching row in `t2', it knows that
          `t2.id' can never be `NULL', and will not scan through the
          rest of the rows in `t2' that has the same `id'.  In other
          words, for each row in `t1', MySQL only needs to do a single
          lookup in `t2', independent of how many matching rows there
          are in `t2'.

    ``range checked for each record (index map: #)''
          MySQL didn't find a real good index to use. It will, instead,
          for each row combination in the preceding tables, do a check
          on which index to use (if any), and use this index to
          retrieve the rows from the table.  This isn't very fast but
          is faster than having to do a join without an index.

    `Using filesort'
          MySQL will need to do an extra pass to find out how to
          retrieve the rows in sorted order.  The sort is done by going
          through all rows according to the `join type' and storing the
          sort key + pointer to the row for all rows that match the
          `WHERE'. Then the keys are sorted. Finally the rows are
          retrieved in sorted order.

    `Using index'
          The column information is retrieved from the table using only
          information in the index tree without having to do an
          additional seek to read the actual row.  This can be done
          when all the used columns for the table are part of the same
          index.

    `Using temporary'
          To resolve the query MySQL will need to create a temporary
          table to hold the result.  This typically happens if you do an
          `ORDER BY' on a different column set than you did a `GROUP
          BY' on.

    `Where used'
          A `WHERE' clause will be used to restrict which rows will be
          matched against the next table or sent to the client.  If you
          don't have this information and the table is of type `ALL' or
          `index', you may have something wrong in your query (if you
          don't intend to fetch/examine all rows from the table).

     If you want to get your queries as fast as possible, you should
     look out for `Using filesort' and `Using temporary'.

The different join types are listed below, ordered from best to worst
type:

`system'
     The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special
     case of the `const' join type.

`const'
     The table has at most one matching row, which will be read at the
     start of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the
     column in this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the
     optimizer. `const' tables are very fast as they are read only once!

`eq_ref'
     One row will be read from this table for each combination of rows
     from the previous tables.  This is the best possible join type,
     other than the `const' types.  It is used when all parts of an
     index are used by the join and the index is `UNIQUE' or a `PRIMARY
     KEY'.

`ref'
     All rows with matching index values will be read from this table
     for each combination of rows from the previous tables.  `ref' is
     used if the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key, or if the
     key is not `UNIQUE' or a `PRIMARY KEY' (in other words, if the
     join cannot select a single row based on the key value).  If the
     key that is used matches only a few rows, this join type is good.

`range'
     Only rows that are in a given range will be retrieved, using an
     index to select the rows.  The `key' column indicates which index
     is used.  The `key_len' contains the longest key part that was
     used.  The `ref' column will be NULL for this type.

`index'
     This is the same as `ALL', except that only the index tree is
     scanned.  This is usually faster than `ALL', as the index file is
     usually smaller than the data file.

`ALL'
     A full table scan will be done for each combination of rows from
     the previous tables.  This is normally not good if the table is
     the first table not marked `const', and usually *very* bad in all
     other cases. You normally can avoid `ALL' by adding more indexes,
     so that the row can be retrieved based on constant values or
     column values from earlier tables.

You can get a good indication of how good a join is by multiplying all
values in the `rows' column of the `EXPLAIN' output. This should tell
you roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query. This
number is also used when you restrict queries with the `max_join_size'
variable.  *Note Server parameters::.

The following example shows how a `JOIN' can be optimized progressively
using the information provided by `EXPLAIN'.

Suppose you have the `SELECT' statement shown below, that you examine
using `EXPLAIN':

     EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
                 tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
                 tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
                 tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
                 tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
                 tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
                 et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
             FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
             WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
                 AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
                 AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
                 AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;

For this example, assume that:

   * The columns being compared have been declared as follows:

     *Table* *Column*      *Column type*
     `tt'    `ActualPC'    `CHAR(10)'
     `tt'    `AssignedPC'  `CHAR(10)'
     `tt'    `ClientID'    `CHAR(10)'
     `et'    `EMPLOYID'    `CHAR(15)'
     `do'    `CUSTNMBR'    `CHAR(15)'

   * The tables have the indexes shown below:

     *Table* *Index*
     `tt'    `ActualPC'
     `tt'    `AssignedPC'
     `tt'    `ClientID'
     `et'    `EMPLOYID' (primary key)
     `do'    `CUSTNMBR' (primary key)

   * The `tt.ActualPC' values aren't evenly distributed.

Initially, before any optimizations have been performed, the `EXPLAIN'
statement produces the following information:

     table type possible_keys                key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
     et    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
     do    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 2135
     et_1  ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
     tt    ALL  AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL    NULL 3872
           range checked for each record (key map: 35)

Because `type' is `ALL' for each table, this output indicates that
MySQL is doing a full join for all tables!  This will take quite a long
time, as the product of the number of rows in each table must be
examined!  For the case at hand, this is `74 * 2135 * 74 * 3872 =
45,268,558,720' rows.  If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine
how long it would take.

One problem here is that MySQL can't (yet) use indexes on columns
efficiently if they are declared differently.  In this context,
`VARCHAR' and `CHAR' are the same unless they are declared as different
lengths. Because `tt.ActualPC' is declared as `CHAR(10)' and
`et.EMPLOYID' is declared as `CHAR(15)', there is a length mismatch.

To fix this disparity between column lengths, use `ALTER TABLE' to
lengthen `ActualPC' from 10 characters to 15 characters:

     mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);

Now `tt.ActualPC' and `et.EMPLOYID' are both `VARCHAR(15)'.  Executing
the `EXPLAIN' statement again produces this result:

     table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
     tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL 3872    where used
     do    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
           range checked for each record (key map: 1)
     et_1  ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        74
           range checked for each record (key map: 1)
     et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1

This is not perfect, but is much better (the product of the `rows'
values is now less by a factor of 74). This version is executed in a
couple of seconds.

A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length
mismatches for the `tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID' and `tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR' comparisons:

     mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
                           MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);

Now `EXPLAIN' produces the output shown below:

     table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref            rows     Extra
     et    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL           74
     tt    ref    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC ActualPC 15 et.EMPLOYID 52 where used
     et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC  1
     do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID    1

This is almost as good as it can get.

The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL assumes that values in
the `tt.ActualPC' column are evenly distributed, and that isn't the
case for the `tt' table.  Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL about
this:

     shell> myisamchk --analyze PATH_TO_MYSQL_DATABASE/tt
     shell> mysqladmin refresh

Now the join is perfect, and `EXPLAIN' produces this result:

     table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref            rows    Extra
     tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL    3872    where used
     et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC    1
     et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC  1
     do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID    1

Note that the `rows' column in the output from `EXPLAIN' is an educated
guess from the MySQL join optimizer. To optimize a query, you should
check if the numbers are even close to the truth.  If not, you may get
better performance by using `STRAIGHT_JOIN' in your `SELECT' statement
and trying to list the tables in a different order in the `FROM' clause.

Estimating Query Performance
----------------------------

In most cases you can estimate the performance by counting disk seeks.
For small tables, you can usually find the row in 1 disk seek (as the
index is probably cached).  For bigger tables, you can estimate that
(using B++ tree indexes) you will need: `log(row_count) /
log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) +
1' seeks to find a row.

In MySQL an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data pointer is
usually 4 bytes. A 500,000 row table with an index length of 3 (medium
integer) gives you: `log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1' = 4 seeks.

As the above index would require about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2 = 5.2M,
(assuming that the index buffers are filled to 2/3, which is typical)
you will probably have much of the index in memory and you will probably
only need 1-2 calls to read data from the OS to find the row.

For writes, however, you will need 4 seek requests (as above) to find
where to place the new index and normally 2 seeks to update the index
and write the row.

Note that the above doesn't mean that your application will slowly
degenerate by N log N!  As long as everything is cached by the OS or SQL
server things will only go marginally slower while the table gets
bigger. After the data gets too big to be cached, things will start to
go much slower until your applications is only bound by disk-seeks
(which increase by N log N). To avoid this, increase the index cache as
the data grows. *Note Server parameters::.

Speed of `SELECT' Queries
-------------------------

In general, when you want to make a slow `SELECT ... WHERE' faster, the
first thing to check is whether or not you can add an index. *Note
MySQL indexes: MySQL indexes. All references between different tables
should usually be done with indexes. You can use the `EXPLAIN' command
to determine which indexes are used for a `SELECT'.  *Note `EXPLAIN':
EXPLAIN.

Some general tips:

   * To help MySQL optimize queries better, run `myisamchk --analyze'
     on a table after it has been loaded with relevant data. This
     updates a value for each index part that indicates the average
     number of rows that have the same value.  (For unique indexes,
     this is always 1, of course.).  MySQL will use this to decide
     which index to choose when you connect two tables with 'a
     non-constant expression'.  You can check the result from the
     `analyze' run by doing `SHOW INDEX FROM table_name' and examining
     the `Cardinality' column.

   * To sort an index and data according to an index, use `myisamchk
     --sort-index --sort-records=1' (if you want to sort on index 1).
     If you have a unique index from which you want to read all records
     in order according to that index, this is a good way to make that
     faster.  Note, however, that this sorting isn't written optimally
     and will take a long time for a large table!

How MySQL Optimizes `WHERE' Clauses
-----------------------------------

The `WHERE' optimizations are put in the `SELECT' part here because
they are mostly used with `SELECT', but the same optimizations apply for
`WHERE' in `DELETE' and `UPDATE' statements.

Also note that this section is incomplete. MySQL does many
optimizations, and we have not had time to document them all.

Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL are listed below:

   * Removal of unnecessary parentheses:
             ((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
          -> (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)

   * Constant folding:
             (a<b AND b=c) AND a=5
          -> b>5 AND b=c AND a=5

   * Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):
             (B>=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
          -> B=5 OR B=6

   * Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.

   * `COUNT(*)' on a single table without a `WHERE' is retrieved
     directly from the table information.  This is also done for any
     `NOT NULL' expression when used with only one table.

   * Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly
     detects that some `SELECT' statements are impossible and returns
     no rows.

   * `HAVING' is merged with `WHERE' if you don't use `GROUP BY' or
     group functions (`COUNT()', `MIN()'...).

   * For each sub-join, a simpler `WHERE' is constructed to get a fast
     `WHERE' evaluation for each sub-join and also to skip records as
     soon as possible.

   * All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the
     query.  A constant table is:
        - An empty table or a table with 1 row.

        - A table that is used with a `WHERE' clause on a `UNIQUE'
          index, or a `PRIMARY KEY', where all index parts are used
          with constant expressions and the index parts are defined as
          `NOT NULL'.
     All the following tables are used as constant tables:
          mysql> SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
          mysql> SELECT * FROM t1,t2
                     WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;

   * The best join combination to join the tables is found by trying all
     possibilities. If all columns in `ORDER BY' and in `GROUP BY' come
     from the same table, then this table is preferred first when
     joining.

   * If there is an `ORDER BY' clause and a different `GROUP BY'
     clause, or if the `ORDER BY' or `GROUP BY' contains columns from
     tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary
     table is created.

   * If you use `SQL_SMALL_RESULT', MySQL will use an in-memory
     temporary table.

   * Each table index is queried, and the best index that spans fewer
     than 30% of the rows is used. If no such index can be found, a
     quick table scan is used.

   * In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even
     consulting the data file.  If all columns used from the index are
     numeric, then only the index tree is used to resolve the query.

   * Before each record is output, those that do not match the `HAVING'
     clause are skipped.

Some examples of queries that are very fast:

     mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
     mysql> SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
     mysql> SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
                WHERE key_part_1=constant;
     mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
                ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;
     mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
                ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... LIMIT 10;

The following queries are resolved using only the index tree (assuming
the indexed columns are numeric):

     mysql> SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
     mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
                WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
     mysql> SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;

The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted order
without a separate sorting pass:

     mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;
     mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... ;


File: mysql.info,  Node: DISTINCT optimization,  Next: LEFT JOIN optimization,  Prev: Where optimizations,  Up: Query Speed

How MySQL Optimizes `DISTINCT'
------------------------------

`DISTINCT' is converted to a `GROUP BY' on all columns, `DISTINCT'
combined with `ORDER BY' will in many cases also need a temporary table.

When combining `LIMIT #' with `DISTINCT', MySQL will stop as soon as it
finds `#' unique rows.

If you don't use columns from all used tables, MySQL will stop the
scanning of the not used tables as soon as it has found the first match.

     SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;

In the case, assuming t1 is used before t2 (check with `EXPLAIN'), then
MySQL will stop reading from t2 (for that particular row in t1) when
the first row in t2 is found.


File: mysql.info,  Node: LEFT JOIN optimization,  Next: LIMIT optimization,  Prev: DISTINCT optimization,  Up: Query Speed

How MySQL Optimizes `LEFT JOIN' and `RIGHT JOIN'
------------------------------------------------

`A LEFT JOIN B' in MySQL is implemented as follows:

   * The table `B' is set to be dependent on table `A' and all tables
     that `A' is dependent on.

   * The table `A' is set to be dependent on all tables (except `B')
     that are used in the `LEFT JOIN' condition.

   * All `LEFT JOIN' conditions are moved to the `WHERE' clause.

   * All standard join optimizations are done, with the exception that
     a table is always read after all tables it is dependent on.  If
     there is a circular dependence then MySQL will issue an error.

   * All standard `WHERE' optimizations are done.

   * If there is a row in `A' that matches the `WHERE' clause, but there
     wasn't any row in `B' that matched the `LEFT JOIN' condition, then
     an extra `B' row is generated with all columns set to `NULL'.

   * If you use `LEFT JOIN' to find rows that don't exist in some table
     and you have the following test: `column_name IS NULL' in the
     `WHERE' part, where column_name is a column that is declared as
     `NOT NULL', then MySQL will stop searching after more rows (for a
     particular key combination) after it has found one row that
     matches the `LEFT JOIN' condition.

`RIGHT JOIN' is implemented analogously as `LEFT JOIN'.

The table read order forced by `LEFT JOIN' and `STRAIGHT JOIN' will
help the join optimizer (which calculates in which order tables should
be joined) to do its work much more quickly, as there are fewer table
permutations to check.

Note that the above means that if you do a query of type:

     SELECT * FROM a,b LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key) WHERE b.key=d.key

MySQL will do a full scan on `b' as the `LEFT JOIN' will force it to be
read before `d'.

The fix in this case is to change the query to:

     SELECT * FROM b,a LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key) WHERE b.key=d.key


File: mysql.info,  Node: LIMIT optimization,  Next: Insert speed,  Prev: LEFT JOIN optimization,  Up: Query Speed

How MySQL Optimizes `LIMIT'
---------------------------

In some cases MySQL will handle the query differently when you are
using `LIMIT #' and not using `HAVING':

   * If you are selecting only a few rows with `LIMIT', MySQL will use
     indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a full
     table scan.

   * If you use `LIMIT #' with `ORDER BY', MySQL will end the sorting
     as soon as it has found the first `#' lines instead of sorting the
     whole table.

   * When combining `LIMIT #' with `DISTINCT', MySQL will stop as soon
     as it finds `#' unique rows.

   * In some cases a `GROUP BY' can be resolved by reading the key in
     order (or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until
     the key value changes.  In this case `LIMIT #' will not calculate
     any unnecessary `GROUP BY''s.

   * As soon as MySQL has sent the first `#' rows to the client, it
     will abort the query.

   * `LIMIT 0' will always quickly return an empty set.  This is useful
     to check the query and to get the column types of the result
     columns.

   * The size of temporary tables uses the `LIMIT #' to calculate how
     much space is needed to resolve the query.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Insert speed,  Next: Update speed,  Prev: LIMIT optimization,  Up: Query Speed

Speed of `INSERT' Queries
-------------------------

The time to insert a record consists approximately of:

   * Connect:                 (3)

   * Sending query to server: (2)

   * Parsing query:           (2)

   * Inserting record:        (1 x size of record)

   * Inserting indexes:       (1 x number of indexes)

   * Close:                   (1)

where the numbers are somewhat proportional to the overall time. This
does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables
(which is done once for each concurrently running query).

The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by N log N
(B-trees).

Some ways to speed up inserts:

   * If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same
     time, use multiple value lists `INSERT' statements. This is much
     faster (many times in some cases) than using separate `INSERT'
     statements.

   * If you are inserting a lot of rows from different clients, you can
     get higher speed by using the `INSERT DELAYED' statement. *Note
     `INSERT': INSERT.

   * Note that with `MyISAM' you can insert rows at the same time
     `SELECT's are running if there are no deleted rows in the tables.

   * When loading a table from a text file, use `LOAD DATA INFILE'. This
     is usually 20 times faster than using a lot of `INSERT' statements.
     *Note `LOAD DATA': LOAD DATA.

   * It is possible with some extra work to make `LOAD DATA INFILE' run
     even faster when the table has many indexes. Use the following
     procedure:

       1. Optionally create the table with `CREATE TABLE'. For example,
          using `mysql' or Perl-DBI.

       2. Execute a `FLUSH TABLES' statement or the shell command
          `mysqladmin flush-tables'.

       3. Use `myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name'. This
          will remove all usage of all indexes from the table.

       4. Insert data into the table with `LOAD DATA INFILE'. This will
          not update any indexes and will therefore be very fast.

       5. If you are going to only read the table in the future, run
          `myisampack' on it to make it smaller. *Note Compressed
          format::.

       6. Re-create the indexes with `myisamchk -r -q
          /path/to/db/tbl_name'. This will create the index tree in
          memory before writing it to disk, which is much faster
          because it avoids lots of disk seeks. The resulting index
          tree is also perfectly balanced.

       7. Execute a `FLUSH TABLES' statement or the shell command
          `mysqladmin flush-tables'.

     This procedure will be built into `LOAD DATA INFILE' in some future
     version of MySQL.

   * You can speed up insertions by locking your tables:

          mysql> LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
          mysql> INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
          mysql> INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
          mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;

     The main speed difference is that the index buffer is flushed to
     disk only once, after all `INSERT' statements have completed.
     Normally there would be as many index buffer flushes as there are
     different `INSERT' statements. Locking is not needed if you can
     insert all rows with a single statement.

     Locking will also lower the total time of multi-connection tests,
     but the maximum wait time for some threads will go up (because
     they wait for locks).  For example:

          thread 1 does 1000 inserts
          thread 2, 3, and 4 does 1 insert
          thread 5 does 1000 inserts

     If you don't use locking, 2, 3, and 4 will finish before 1 and 5.
     If you use locking, 2, 3, and 4 probably will not finish before 1
     or 5, but the total time should be about 40% faster.

     As `INSERT', `UPDATE', and `DELETE' operations are very fast in
     MySQL, you will obtain better overall performance by adding locks
     around everything that does more than about 5 inserts or updates
     in a row.  If you do very many inserts in a row, you could do a
     `LOCK TABLES' followed by an `UNLOCK TABLES' once in a while
     (about each 1000 rows) to allow other threads access to the table.
     This would still result in a nice performance gain.

     Of course, `LOAD DATA INFILE' is much faster for loading data.

To get some more speed for both `LOAD DATA INFILE' and `INSERT',
enlarge the key buffer. *Note Server parameters::.

Speed of `UPDATE' Queries
-------------------------

Update queries are optimized as a `SELECT' query with the additional
overhead of a write. The speed of the write is dependent on the size of
the data that is being updated and the number of indexes that are
updated.  Indexes that are not changed will not be updated.

Also, another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do
many updates in a row later. Doing many updates in a row is much quicker
than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

Note that, with dynamic record format, updating a record to a longer
total length may split the record.  So if you do this often, it is very
important to `OPTIMIZE TABLE' sometimes.  *Note `OPTIMIZE TABLE':
OPTIMIZE TABLE.

Speed of `DELETE' Queries
-------------------------

If you want to delete all rows in the table, you should use `TRUNCATE
TABLE table_name'. *Note TRUNCATE::.

The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of
indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of
the index cache. *Note Server parameters::.

Other Optimization Tips
-----------------------

Unsorted tips for faster systems:

   * Use persistent connections to the database to avoid the connection
     overhead. If you can't use persistent connections and you are
     doing a lot of new connections to the database, you may want to
     change the value of the `thread_cache_size' variable. *Note Server
     parameters::.

   * Always check that all your queries really use the indexes you have
     created in the tables. In MySQL you can do this with the `EXPLAIN'
     command. *Note Explain: (manual)EXPLAIN.

   * Try to avoid complex `SELECT' queries on tables that are updated a
     lot. This is to avoid problems with table locking.

   * The new `MyISAM' tables can insert rows in a table without deleted
     rows at the same time another table is reading from it.  If this
     is important for you, you should consider methods where you don't
     have to delete rows or run `OPTIMIZE TABLE' after you have deleted
     a lot of rows.

   * Use `ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY expr1,expr2...' if you mostly
     retrieve rows in expr1,expr2.. order.  By using this option after
     big changes to the table, you may be able to get higher
     performance.

   * In some cases it may make sense to introduce a column that is
     'hashed' based on information from other columns. If this column
     is short and reasonably unique it may be much faster than a big
     index on many columns. In MySQL it's very easy to use this extra
     column: `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE hash=MD5(concat(col1,col2))
     AND col_1='constant' AND col_2='constant''

   * For tables that change a lot you should try to avoid all `VARCHAR'
     or `BLOB' columns. You will get dynamic row length as soon as you
     are using a single `VARCHAR' or `BLOB' column. *Note Table types::.

   * It's not normally useful to split a table into different tables
     just because the rows gets 'big'. To access a row, the biggest
     performance hit is the disk seek to find the first byte of the
     row. After finding the data most new disks can read the whole row
     fast enough for most applications. The only cases where it really
     matters to split up a table is if it's a dynamic row size table
     (see above) that you can change to a fixed row size, or if you
     very often need to scan the table and don't need most of the
     columns. *Note Table types::.

   * If you very often need to calculate things based on information
     from a lot of rows (like counts of things), it's probably much
     better to introduce a new table and update the counter in real
     time. An update of type `UPDATE table set count=count+1 where
     index_column=constant' is very fast!

     This is really important when you use databases like MySQL that
     only have table locking (multiple readers / single writers). This
     will also give better performance with most databases, as the row
     locking manager in this case will have less to do.

   * If you need to collect statistics from big log tables, use summary
     tables instead of scanning the whole table. Maintaining the
     summaries should be much faster than trying to do statistics
     'live'. It's much faster to regenerate new summary tables from the
     logs when things change (depending on business decisions) than to
     have to change the running application!

   * If possible, one should classify reports as 'live' or
     'statistical', where data needed for statistical reports are only
     generated based on summary tables that are generated from the
     actual data.

   * Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert
     values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from
     the default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL need to do and
     improves the insert speed.

   * In some cases it's convenient to pack and store data into a blob.
     In this case you have to add some extra code in your application
     to pack/unpack things in the blob, but this may save a lot of
     accesses at some stage.  This is practical when you have data that
     doesn't conform to a static table structure.

   * Normally you should try to keep all data non-redundant (what is
     called 3rd normal form in database theory), but you should not be
     afraid of duplicating things or creating summary tables if you
     need these to gain more speed.

   * Stored procedures or UDF (user-defined functions) may be a good
     way to get more performance.  In this case you should, however,
     always have a way to do this some other (slower) way if you use
     some database that doesn't support this.

   * You can always gain something by caching queries/answers in your
     application and trying to do many inserts/updates at the same
     time.  If your database supports lock tables (like MySQL and
     Oracle), this should help to ensure that the index cache is only
     flushed once after all updates.

   * Use `INSERT /*! DELAYED */' when you do not need to know when your
     data is written. This speeds things up because many records can be
     written with a single disk write.

   * Use `INSERT /*! LOW_PRIORITY */' when you want your selects to be
     more important.

   * Use `SELECT /*! HIGH_PRIORITY */' to get selects that jump the
     queue. That is, the select is done even if there is somebody
     waiting to do a write.

   * Use the multi-line `INSERT' statement to store many rows with one
     SQL command (many SQL servers supports this).

   * Use `LOAD DATA INFILE' to load bigger amounts of data. This is
     faster than normal inserts and will be even faster when `myisamchk'
     is integrated in `mysqld'.

   * Use `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns to make unique values.

   * Use `OPTIMIZE TABLE' once in a while to avoid fragmentation when
     using dynamic table format. *Note `OPTIMIZE TABLE': OPTIMIZE TABLE.

   * Use `HEAP' tables to get more speed when possible. *Note Table
     types::.

   * When using a normal Web server setup, images should be stored as
     files. That is, store only a file reference in the database.  The
     main reason for this is that a normal Web server is much better at
     caching files than database contents. So it it's much easier to
     get a fast system if you are using files.

   * Use in memory tables for non-critical data that are accessed often
     (like information about the last shown banner for users that don't
     have cookies).

   * Columns with identical information in different tables should be
     declared identical and have identical names. Before Version 3.23
     you got slow joins otherwise.

     Try to keep the names simple (use `name' instead of
     `customer_name' in the customer table). To make your names portable
     to other SQL servers you should keep them shorter than 18
     characters.

   * If you need REALLY high speed, you should take a look at the
     low-level interfaces for data storage that the different SQL
     servers support!  For example, by accessing the MySQL `MyISAM'
     directly, you could get a speed increase of 2-5 times compared to
     using the SQL interface.  To be able to do this the data must be
     on the same server as the application, and usually it should only
     be accessed by one process (because external file locking is
     really slow).  One could eliminate the above problems by
     introducing low-level `MyISAM' commands in the MySQL server (this
     could be one easy way to get more performance if needed).  By
     carefully designing the database interface, it should be quite
     easy to support this types of optimization.

   * In many cases it's faster to access data from a database (using a
     live connection) than accessing a text file, just because the
     database is likely to be more compact than the text file (if you
     are using numerical data), and this will involve fewer disk
     accesses.  You will also save code because you don't have to parse
     your text files to find line and column boundaries.

   * You can also use replication to speed things up. *Note
     Replication::.

   * Declaring a table with `DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1' will make the updating
     of indexes faster, as these are not logged to disk until the file
     is closed.  The downside is that you should run `myisamchk' on
     these tables before you start `mysqld' to ensure that they are
     okay if something killed `mysqld' in the middle.  As the key
     information can always be generated from the data, you should not
     lose anything by using `DELAY_KEY_WRITE'.

How MySQL Locks Tables
----------------------

You can find a discussion about different locking methods in the
appendix.  *Note Locking methods::.

All locking in MySQL is deadlock-free.  This is managed by always
requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning of a query and
always locking the tables in the same order.

The locking method MySQL uses for `WRITE' locks works as follows:

   * If there are no locks on the table, put a write lock on it.

   * Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.

The locking method MySQL uses for `READ' locks works as follows:

   * If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.

   * Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.

When a lock is released, the lock is made available to the threads in
the write lock queue, then to the threads in the read lock queue.

This means that if you have many updates on a table, `SELECT'
statements will wait until there are no more updates.

To work around this for the case where you want to do many `INSERT' and
`SELECT' operations on a table, you can insert rows in a temporary
table and update the real table with the records from the temporary
table once in a while.

This can be done with the following code:
     mysql> LOCK TABLES real_table WRITE, insert_table WRITE;
     mysql> insert into real_table select * from insert_table;
     mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE insert_table;
     mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;

You can use the `LOW_PRIORITY' options with `INSERT', `UPDATE' or
`DELETE' or `HIGH_PRIORITY' with `SELECT' if you want to prioritize
retrieval in some specific cases.  You can also start `mysqld' with
`--low-priority-updates' to get the same behaveour.

Using `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT' can also help making table locks shorter.
*Note SELECT::.

You could also change the locking code in `mysys/thr_lock.c' to use a
single queue.  In this case, write locks and read locks would have the
same priority, which might help some applications.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Table locking,  Prev: Internal locking,  Up: Locking Issues

Table Locking Issues
--------------------

The table locking code in MySQL is deadlock free.

MySQL uses table locking (instead of row locking or column locking) on
all table types, except `BDB' tables, to achieve a very high lock
speed.  For large tables, table locking is MUCH better than row locking
for most applications, but there are, of course, some pitfalls.

For `BDB' and `InnoDB' tables, MySQL only uses table locking if you
explicitely lock the table with `LOCK TABLES' or execute a command that
will modify every row in the table, like `ALTER TABLE'.  For these
table types we recommend you to not use `LOCK TABLES' at all.

In MySQL Version 3.23.7 and above, you can insert rows into `MyISAM'
tables at the same time other threads are reading from the table.  Note
that currently this only works if there are no holes after deleted rows
in the table at the time the insert is made. When all holes has been
filled with new data, concurrent inserts will automatically be enabled
again.

Table locking enables many threads to read from a table at the same
time, but if a thread wants to write to a table, it must first get
exclusive access.  During the update, all other threads that want to
access this particular table will wait until the update is ready.

As updates on tables normally are considered to be more important than
`SELECT', all statements that update a table have higher priority than
statements that retrieve information from a table. This should ensure
that updates are not 'starved' because one issues a lot of heavy
queries against a specific table. (You can change this by using
LOW_PRIORITY with the statement that does the update or `HIGH_PRIORITY'
with the `SELECT' statement.)

Starting from MySQL Version 3.23.7 one can use the
`max_write_lock_count' variable to force MySQL to temporary give all
`SELECT' statements, that wait for a table, a higher priority after a
specific number of inserts on a table.

Table locking is, however, not very good under the following senario:

   * A client issues a `SELECT' that takes a long time to run.

   * Another client then issues an `UPDATE' on a used table. This client
     will wait until the `SELECT' is finished.

   * Another client issues another `SELECT' statement on the same
     table. As `UPDATE' has higher priority than `SELECT', this `SELECT'
     will wait for the `UPDATE' to finish.  It will also wait for the
     first `SELECT' to finish!

   * A thread is waiting for something like `full disk', in which case
     all threads that wants to access the problem table will also be
     put in a waiting state until more disk space is made available.

Some possible solutions to this problem are:

   * Try to get the `SELECT' statements to run faster. You may have to
     create some summary tables to do this.

   * Start `mysqld' with `--low-priority-updates'.  This will give all
     statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than a
     `SELECT' statement. In this case the last `SELECT' statement in
     the previous scenario would execute before the `INSERT' statement.

   * You can give a specific `INSERT', `UPDATE', or `DELETE' statement
     lower priority with the `LOW_PRIORITY' attribute.

   * Start `mysqld' with a low value for *max_write_lock_count* to give
     `READ' locks after a certain number of `WRITE' locks.

   * You can specify that all updates from a specific thread should be
     done with low priority by using the SQL command: `SET
     SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1'.  *Note `SET OPTION': SET OPTION.

   * You can specify that a specific `SELECT' is very important with the
     `HIGH_PRIORITY' attribute. *Note `SELECT': SELECT.

   * If you have problems with `INSERT' combined with `SELECT', switch
     to use the new `MyISAM' tables as these support concurrent
     `SELECT's and `INSERT's.

   * If you mainly mix `INSERT' and `SELECT' statements, the `DELAYED'
     attribute to `INSERT' will probably solve your problems.  *Note
     `INSERT': INSERT.

   * If you have problems with `SELECT' and `DELETE', the `LIMIT'
     option to `DELETE' may help. *Note `DELETE': DELETE.

Design Choices
--------------

MySQL keeps row data and index data in separate files. Many (almost
all) other databases mix row and index data in the same file. We
believe that the MySQL choice is better for a very wide range of modern
systems.

Another way to store the row data is to keep the information for each
column in a separate area (examples are SDBM and Focus). This will
cause a performance hit for every query that accesses more than one
column. Because this degenerates so quickly when more than one column
is accessed, we believe that this model is not good for general purpose
databases.

The more common case is that the index and data are stored together
(like in Oracle/Sybase et al). In this case you will find the row
information at the leaf page of the index. The good thing with this
layout is that it, in many cases, depending on how well the index is
cached, saves a disk read.  The bad things with this layout are:

   * Table scanning is much slower because you have to read through the
     indexes to get at the data.

   * You can't use only the index table to retrieve data for a query.

   * You lose a lot of space, as you must duplicate indexes from the
     nodes (as you can't store the row in the nodes).

   * Deletes will degenerate the table over time (as indexes in nodes
     are usually not updated on delete).

   * It's harder to cache ONLY the index data.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Data size,  Next: MySQL indexes,  Prev: Design,  Up: Optimizing Database Structure

Get Your Data as Small as Possible
----------------------------------

One of the most basic optimization is to get your data (and indexes) to
take as little space on the disk (and in memory) as possible. This can
give huge improvements because disk reads are faster and normally less
main memory will be used. Indexing also takes less resources if done on
smaller columns.

MySQL supports a lot of different table types and row formats.
Choosing the right table format may give you a big performance gain.
*Note Table types::.

You can get better performance on a table and minimize storage space
using the techniques listed below:

   * Use the most efficient (smallest) types possible. MySQL has many
     specialized types that save disk space and memory.

   * Use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables.
     For example, `MEDIUMINT' is often better than `INT'.

   * Declare columns to be `NOT NULL' if possible. It makes everything
     faster and you save one bit per column. Note that if you really
     need `NULL' in your application you should definitely use it. Just
     avoid having it on all columns by default.

   * If you don't have any variable-length columns (`VARCHAR', `TEXT',
     or `BLOB' columns), a fixed-size record format is used. This is
     faster but unfortunately may waste some space.  *Note MyISAM table
     formats::.

   * The primary index of a table should be as short as possible. This
     makes identification of one row easy and efficient.

   * For each table, you have to decide which storage/index method to
     use. *Note Table types::.

   * Only create the indexes that you really need. Indexes are good for
     retrieval but bad when you need to store things fast. If you mostly
     access a table by searching on a combination of columns, make an
     index on them. The first index part should be the most used
     column. If you are ALWAYS using many columns, you should use the
     column with more duplicates first to get better compression of the
     index.

   * If it's very likely that a column has a unique prefix on the first
     number of characters, it's better to only index this prefix. MySQL
     supports an index on a part of a character column. Shorter indexes
     are faster not only because they take less disk space but also
     because they will give you more hits in the index cache and thus
     fewer disk seeks. *Note Server parameters::.

   * In some circumstances it can be beneficial to split into two a
     table that is scanned very often. This is especially true if it is
     a dynamic format table and it is possible to use a smaller static
     format table that can be used to find the relevant rows when
     scanning the table.

How MySQL Uses Indexes
----------------------

Indexes are used to find rows with a specific value of one column fast.
Without an index MySQL has to start with the first record and then read
through the whole table until it finds the relevant rows. The bigger
the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index for the
columns in question, MySQL can quickly get a position to seek to in the
middle of the data file without having to look at all the data. If a
table has 1000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than reading
sequentially. Note that if you need to access almost all 1000 rows it
is faster to read sequentially because we then avoid disk seeks.

All MySQL indexes (`PRIMARY', `UNIQUE', and `INDEX') are stored in
B-trees. Strings are automatically prefix- and end-space compressed.
*Note `CREATE INDEX': CREATE INDEX.

Indexes are used to:
   * Quickly find the rows that match a `WHERE' clause.

   * Retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.

   * Find the `MAX()' or `MIN()' value for a specific indexed column.
     This is optimized by a preprocessor that checks if you are using
     `WHERE' key_part_# = constant on all key parts < N.  In this case
     MySQL will do a single key lookup and replace the `MIN()'
     expression with a constant.  If all expressions are replaced with
     constants, the query will return at once:

          SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2) FROM table_name where key_part1=10

   * Sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a
     leftmost prefix of a usable key (for example, `ORDER BY
     key_part_1,key_part_2 '). The key is read in reverse order if all
     key parts are followed by `DESC'.

     The index can also be used even if the `ORDER BY' doesn't match
     the index exactly, as long as all the unused index parts and all
     the extra are `ORDER BY' columns are constants in the `WHERE'
     clause. The following queries will use the index to resolve the
     `ORDER BY' part:

          SELECT * FROM foo ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,key_part3;
          SELECT * FROM foo WHERE column=constant ORDER BY column, key_part1;
          SELECT * FROM foo WHERE key_part1=const GROUP BY key_part2;

   * In some cases a query can be optimized to retrieve values without
     consulting the data file. If all used columns for some table are
     numeric and form a leftmost prefix for some key, the values may be
     retrieved from the index tree for greater speed:

          SELECT key_part3 FROM table_name WHERE key_part1=1


Suppose you issue the following `SELECT' statement:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;

If a multiple-column index exists on `col1' and `col2', the appropriate
rows can be fetched directly. If separate single-column indexes exist
on `col1' and `col2', the optimizer tries to find the most restrictive
index by deciding which index will find fewer rows and using that index
to fetch the rows.

If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the
index can be used by the optimizer to find rows. For example, if you
have a three-column index on `(col1,col2,col3)', you have indexed
search capabilities on `(col1)', `(col1,col2)', and `(col1,col2,col3)'.

MySQL can't use a partial index if the columns don't form a leftmost
prefix of the index.  Suppose you have the `SELECT' statements shown
below:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;

If an index exists on `(col1,col2,col3)', only the first query shown
above uses the index. The second and third queries do involve indexed
columns, but `(col2)' and `(col2,col3)' are not leftmost prefixes of
`(col1,col2,col3)'.

MySQL also uses indexes for `LIKE' comparisons if the argument to
`LIKE' is a constant string that doesn't start with a wild-card
character.  For example, the following `SELECT' statements use indexes:

     mysql> select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "Patrick%";
     mysql> select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "Pat%_ck%";

In the first statement, only rows with `"Patrick" <= key_col <
"Patricl"' are considered.  In the second statement, only rows with
`"Pat" <= key_col < "Pau"' are considered.

The following `SELECT' statements will not use indexes:
     mysql> select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE "%Patrick%";
     mysql> select * from tbl_name where key_col LIKE other_col;

In the first statement, the `LIKE' value begins with a wild-card
character.  In the second statement, the `LIKE' value is not a constant.

Searching using `column_name IS NULL' will use indexes if column_name
is an index.

MySQL normally uses the index that finds the least number of rows. An
index is used for columns that you compare with the following operators:
`=', `>', `>=', `<', `<=', `BETWEEN', and a `LIKE' with a non-wild-card
prefix like `'something%''.

Any index that doesn't span all `AND' levels in the `WHERE' clause is
not used to optimize the query. In other words:  To be able to use an
index, a prefix of the index must be used in every `AND' group.

The following `WHERE' clauses use indexes:
     ... WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
     ... WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2      /* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
     ... WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part_3=5
               /* optimized like "index_part1='hello'" */
     ... WHERE index1=1 and index2=2 or index1=3 and index3=3;
               /* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index 3 */

These `WHERE' clauses do *NOT* use indexes:
     ... WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2  /* index_part_1 is not used */
     ... WHERE index=1 OR A=10                  /* Index is not used in both AND parts */
     ... WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10  /* No index spans all rows */

Note that in some cases MySQL will not use an index, even if one would
be available.  Some of the cases where this happens are:

   * If the use of the index would require MySQL to access more than 30
     % of the rows in the table.  (In this case a table scan is
     probably much faster, as this will require us to do much fewer
     seeks).  Note that if such a query uses `LIMIT' to only retrieve
     part of the rows, MySQL will use an index anyway, as it can much
     more quickly find the few rows to return in the result.

Column Indexes
--------------

All MySQL column types can be indexed.  Use of indexes on the relevant
columns is the best way to improve the performance of `SELECT'
operations.

The maximum number of keys and the maximum index length is defined per
table handler. *Note Table types::. You can with all table handlers have
at least 16 keys and a total index length of at least 256 bytes.

For `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' columns, you can index a prefix of a column.
This is much faster and requires less disk space than indexing the
whole column.  The syntax to use in the `CREATE TABLE' statement to
index a column prefix looks like this:

     KEY index_name (col_name(length))

The example below creates an index for the first 10 characters of the
`name' column:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE test (
                name CHAR(200) NOT NULL,
                KEY index_name (name(10)));

For `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns, you must index a prefix of the column.
You cannot index the entire column.

In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
*FULLTEXT* indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
`MyISAM' table type supports `FULLTEXT' indexes. They can be created
only from `VARCHAR' and `TEXT' columns.  Indexing always happens over
the entire column and partial indexing is not supported. See *Note
Fulltext Search:: for details.

Multiple-Column Indexes
-----------------------

MySQL can create indexes on multiple columns.  An index may consist of
up to 15 columns. (On `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' columns you can also use a
prefix of the column as a part of an index).

A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array containing
values that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed
columns.

MySQL uses multiple-column indexes in such a way that queries are fast
when you specify a known quantity for the first column of the index in a
`WHERE' clause, even if you don't specify values for the other columns.

Suppose a table is created using the following specification:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE test (
                id INT NOT NULL,
                last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
                first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
                PRIMARY KEY (id),
                INDEX name (last_name,first_name));

Then the index `name' is an index over `last_name' and `first_name'.
The index will be used for queries that specify values in a known range
for `last_name', or for both `last_name' and `first_name'.  Therefore,
the `name' index will be used in the following queries:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius";
     
     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                               AND first_name="Michael";
     
     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                               AND (first_name="Michael" OR first_name="Monty");
     
     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                               AND first_name >="M" AND first_name < "N";

However, the `name' index will NOT be used in the following queries:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name="Michael";
     
     mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
                               OR first_name="Michael";

For more information on the manner in which MySQL uses indexes to
improve query performance, see *Note MySQL indexes: MySQL indexes.

How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables
---------------------------------

`table_cache', `max_connections', and `max_tmp_tables' affect the
maximum number of files the server keeps open.  If you increase one or
both of these values, you may run up against a limit imposed by your
operating system on the per-process number of open file descriptors.
However, you can increase the limit on many systems.  Consult your OS
documentation to find out how to do this, because the method for
changing the limit varies widely from system to system.

`table_cache' is related to `max_connections'.  For example, for 200
concurrent running connections, you should have a table cache of at
least `200 * n', where `n' is the maximum number of tables in a join.
You also need to reserve some extra file descriptors for temporary
tables and files.

The cache of open tables can grow to a maximum of `table_cache'
(default 64; this can be changed with the `-O table_cache=#' option to
`mysqld').  A table is never closed, except when the cache is full and
another thread tries to open a table or if you use `mysqladmin refresh'
or `mysqladmin flush-tables'.

When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure
to locate a cache entry to use:

   * Tables that are not currently in use are released, in
     least-recently-used order.

   * If the cache is full and no tables can be released, but a new
     table needs to be opened, the cache is temporarily extended as
     necessary.

   * If the cache is in a temporarily-extended state and a table goes
     from in-use to not-in-use state, the table is closed and released
     from the cache.

A table is opened for each concurrent access. This means that if you
have two threads accessing the same table or access the table twice in
the same query (with `AS') the table needs to be opened twice.  The
first open of any table takes two file descriptors; each additional use
of the table takes only one file descriptor.  The extra descriptor for
the first open is used for the index file; this descriptor is shared
among all threads.

You can check if your table cache is too small by checking the mysqld
variable `opened_tables'.  If this is quite big, even if you haven't
done a lot of `FLUSH TABLES', you should increase your table cache.
*Note SHOW STATUS::.

Drawbacks to Creating Large Numbers of Tables in the Same Database
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have many files in a directory, open, close, and create
operations will be slow.  If you execute `SELECT' statements on many
different tables, there will be a little overhead when the table cache
is full, because for every table that has to be opened, another must be
closed. You can reduce this overhead by making the table cache larger.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Open tables,  Prev: Creating many tables,  Up: Optimizing Database Structure

Why So Many Open tables?
------------------------

When you run `mysqladmin status', you'll see something like this:

     Uptime: 426 Running threads: 1 Questions: 11082 Reloads: 1 Open tables: 12

This can be somewhat perplexing if you only have 6 tables.

MySQL is multithreaded, so it may have many queries on the same table
simultaneously. To minimize the problem with two threads having
different states on the same file, the table is opened independently by
each concurrent thread. This takes some memory and one extra file
descriptor for the data file. The index file descriptor is shared
between all threads.

System/Compile Time and Startup Parameter Tuning
------------------------------------------------

We start with the system level things since some of these decisions have
to be made very early. In other cases a fast look at this part may
suffice because it not that important for the big gains. However, it is
always nice to have a feeling about how much one could gain by changing
things at this level.

The default OS to use is really important!  To get the most use of
multiple CPU machines one should use Solaris (because the threads works
really nice) or Linux (because the 2.2 kernel has really good SMP
support). Also on 32-bit machines Linux has a 2G file size limit by
default. Hopefully this will be fixed soon when new filesystems are
released (XFS/Reiserfs).  If you have a desperate need for files bigger
than 2G on Linux-intel 32 bit, you should get the LFS patch for the ext2
file system.

Because we have not run MySQL in production on that many platforms, we
advice you to test your intended platform before choosing it, if
possible.

Other tips:
   * If you have enough RAM, you could remove all swap devices. Some
     operating systems will use a swap device in some contexts even if
     you have free memory.

   * Use the `--skip-locking' MySQL option to avoid external locking.
     Note that this will not impact MySQL's functionality as long as
     you only run one server. Just remember to take down the server (or
     lock relevant parts) before you run `myisamchk'. On some system
     this switch is mandatory because the external locking does not
     work in any case.

     The `--skip-locking' option is on by default when compiling with
     MIT-pthreads, because `flock()' isn't fully supported by
     MIT-pthreads on all platforms.  It's also on default for Linux as
     Linux file locking are not yet safe.

     The only case when you can't use `--skip-locking' is if you run
     multiple MySQL _servers_ (not clients) on the same data, or run
     `myisamchk' on the table without first flushing and locking the
     `mysqld' server tables first.

     You can still use `LOCK TABLES'/`UNLOCK TABLES' even if you are
     using `--skip-locking'

this command:

     shell> mysqld --help

This command produces a list of all `mysqld' options and configurable

     wait_timeout          current value: 28800

If there is a `mysqld' server currently running, you can see what
values it actually is using for the variables by executing this command:

     shell> mysqladmin variables

You can find a full description for all variables in the `SHOW
VARIABLES' section in this manual. *Note SHOW VARIABLES::.

You can also see some statistics from a running server by issuing the
command `SHOW STATUS'. *Note SHOW STATUS::.

MySQL uses algorithms that are very scalable, so you can usually run
with very little memory. If you, however, give MySQL more memory, you
will normally also get better performance.

When tuning a MySQL server, the two most important variables to use are
`key_buffer_size' and `table_cache'.  You should first feel confident
that you have these right before trying to change any of the other
variables.

If you have much memory (>=256M) and many tables and want maximum
performance with a moderate number of clients, you should use something
like this:

     shell> safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=64M -O table_cache=256 \
                -O sort_buffer=4M -O record_buffer=1M &

If you have only 128M and only a few tables, but you still do a lot of
sorting, you can use something like:

     shell> safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=16M -O sort_buffer=1M

If you have little memory and lots of connections, use something like
this:

     shell> safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=100k \
                -O record_buffer=100k &

or even:

     shell> safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=16k \
                -O table_cache=32 -O record_buffer=8k -O net_buffer=1K &

If you are doing a `GROUP BY' or `ORDER BY' on files that are much
bigger than your available memory you should increase the value of
`record_rnd_buffer' to speed up the reading of rows after the sorting
is done.

When you have installed MySQL, the `support-files' directory will
contain some different `my.cnf' example files, `my-huge.cnf',
`my-large.cnf', `my-medium.cnf', and `my-small.cnf', you can use as a
base to optimize your system.

If there are very many connections, "swapping problems" may occur unless
`mysqld' has been configured to use very little memory for each
connection. `mysqld' performs better if you have enough memory for all
connections, of course.

Note that if you change an option to `mysqld', it remains in effect only
for that instance of the server.

To see the effects of a parameter change, do something like this:

     shell> mysqld -O key_buffer=32m --help

Make sure that the `--help' option is last; otherwise, the effect of any
options listed after it on the command line will not be reflected in the
output.

How Compiling and Linking Affects the Speed of MySQL
----------------------------------------------------

Most of the following tests are done on Linux with the MySQL
benchmarks, but they should give some indication for other operating
systems and workloads.

You get the fastest executable when you link with `-static'.

On Linux, you will get the fastest code when compiling with `pgcc' and
`-O3'. To compile `sql_yacc.cc' with these options, you need about 200M
memory because `gcc/pgcc' needs a lot of memory to make all functions
inline. You should also set `CXX=gcc' when configuring MySQL to avoid
inclusion of the `libstdc++' library (it is not needed). Note that with
some versions of `pgcc', the resulting code will only run on true
Pentium processors, even if you use the compiler option that you want
the resulting code to be working on all x586 type processors (like AMD).

By just using a better compiler and/or better compiler options you can
get a 10-30 % speed increase in your application.  This is particularly
important if you compile the SQL server yourself!

We have tested both the Cygnus CodeFusion and Fujitsu compilers, but
when we tested them, neither was sufficiently bug free to allow MySQL
to be compiled with optimizations on.

When you compile MySQL you should only include support for the
character sets that you are going to use. (Option `--with-charset=xxx').
The standard MySQL binary distributions are compiled with support for
all character sets.

Here is a list of some measurements that we have done:
   * If you use `pgcc' and compile everything with `-O6', the `mysqld'
     server is 1% faster than with `gcc' 2.95.2.

   * If you link dynamically (without `-static'), the result is 13%
     slower on Linux.  Note that you still can use a dynamic linked
     MySQL library. It is only the server that is critical for
     performance.

   * If you strip your `mysqld' binary with `strip libexec/mysqld', the
     resulting binary can be up to 4 % faster.

   * If you connect using TCP/IP rather than Unix sockets, the result
     is 7.5% slower on the same computer. (If you are connection to
     `localhost', MySQL will, by default, use sockets).

   * If you connect using TCP/IP from another computer over a 100M
     Ethernet, things will be 8-11 % slower.

   * If you compile with `--with-debug=full', then you will loose 20 %
     for most queries, but some queries may take substantially longer
     (The MySQL benchmarks ran 35 % slower) If you use `--with-debug',
     then you will only loose 15 %.  By starting a `mysqld' version
     compiled with `--with-debug=full' with `--skip-safemalloc' the end
     result should be close to when configuring with `--with-debug'.

   * On a Sun SPARCstation 20, SunPro C++ 4.2 is 5 % faster than `gcc'
     2.95.2.

   * Compiling with `gcc' 2.95.2 for ultrasparc with the option
     `-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa' gives 4 % more performance.

   * On Solaris 2.5.1, MIT-pthreads is 8-12% slower than Solaris native
     threads on a single processor. With more load/CPUs the difference
     should get bigger.

   * Running with `--log-bin' makes *[MySQL* 1 % slower.

   * Compiling on Linux-x86 using gcc without frame pointers
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' or `-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp'
     `mysqld' 1-4% faster.

The MySQL-Linux distribution provided by MySQL AB used to be compiled
with `pgcc', but we had to go back to regular gcc because of a bug in
`pgcc' that would generate the code that does not run on AMD. We will
continue using gcc until that bug is resolved.  In the meantime, if you
have a non-AMD machine, you can get a faster binary by compiling with
`pgcc'.  The standard MySQL Linux binary is linked statically to get it
faster and more portable.

How MySQL Uses Memory
---------------------

The list below indicates some of the ways that the `mysqld' server uses
memory.  Where applicable, the name of the server variable relevant to
the memory use is given:

   * The key buffer (variable `key_buffer_size') is shared by all
     threads; Other buffers used by the server are allocated as needed.
     *Note Server parameters::.

   * Each connection uses some thread-specific space: A stack (default
     64K, variable `thread_stack'), a connection buffer (variable
     `net_buffer_length'), and a result buffer (variable
     `net_buffer_length'). The connection buffer and result buffer are
     dynamically enlarged up to `max_allowed_packet' when needed.  When
     a query is running, a copy of the current query string is also
     allocated.

   * All threads share the same base memory.

   * Only the compressed ISAM / MyISAM tables are memory mapped.  This
     is because the 32-bit memory space of 4GB is not large enough for
     most big tables. When systems with a 64-bit address space become
     more common we may add general support for memory mapping.

   * Each request doing a sequential scan over a table allocates a read
     buffer (variable `record_buffer').

   * When reading rows in 'random' order (for example after a sort) a
     random-read buffer is allocated to avoid disk seeks.  (variable
     `record_rnd_buffer').

   * All joins are done in one pass, and most joins can be done without
     even using a temporary table. Most temporary tables are
     memory-based (HEAP) tables.  Temporary tables with a big record
     length (calculated as the sum of all column lengths) or that
     contain `BLOB' columns are stored on disk.

     One problem in MySQL versions before Version 3.23.2 is that if a
     HEAP table exceeds the size of `tmp_table_size', you get the error
     `The table tbl_name is full'. In newer versions this is handled by
     automatically changing the in-memory (HEAP) table to a disk-based
     (MyISAM) table as necessary. To work around this problem, you can
     increase the temporary table size by setting the `tmp_table_size'
     option to `mysqld', or by setting the SQL option `SQL_BIG_TABLES'
     in the client program.  *Note `SET OPTION': SET OPTION. In MySQL
     Version 3.20, the maximum size of the temporary table was
     `record_buffer*16', so if you are using this version, you have to
     increase the value of `record_buffer'. You can also start `mysqld'
     with the `--big-tables' option to always store temporary tables on
     disk. However, this will affect the speed of many complicated
     queries.

   * Most requests doing a sort allocates a sort buffer and 0-2
     temporary files depending on the result set size. *Note Temporary
     files::.

   * Almost all parsing and calculating is done in a local memory
     store. No memory overhead is needed for small items and the normal
     slow memory allocation and freeing is avoided. Memory is allocated
     only for unexpectedly large strings (this is done with `malloc()'
     and `free()').

   * Each index file is opened once and the data file is opened once
     for each concurrently running thread. For each concurrent thread,
     a table structure, column structures for each column, and a buffer
     of size `3 * n' is allocated (where `n' is the maximum row length,
     not counting `BLOB' columns). A `BLOB' uses 5 to 8 bytes plus the
     length of the `BLOB' data. The `ISAM'/`MyISAM' table handlers will
     use one extra row buffer for internal usage.

   * For each table having `BLOB' columns, a buffer is enlarged
     dynamically to read in larger `BLOB' values. If you scan a table,
     a buffer as large as the largest `BLOB' value is allocated.

   * Table handlers for all in-use tables are saved in a cache and
     managed as a FIFO. Normally the cache has 64 entries. If a table
     has been used by two running threads at the same time, the cache
     contains two entries for the table. *Note Table cache::.

   * A `mysqladmin flush-tables' command closes all tables that are not
     in use and marks all in-use tables to be closed when the currently
     executing thread finishes. This will effectively free most in-use
     memory.

`ps' and other system status programs may report that `mysqld' uses a
lot of memory. This may be caused by thread-stacks on different memory
addresses. For example, the Solaris version of `ps' counts the unused
memory between stacks as used memory. You can verify this by checking
available swap with `swap -s'. We have tested `mysqld' with commercial
memory-leakage detectors, so there should be no memory leaks.

How MySQL uses DNS
------------------

When a new thread connects to `mysqld', `mysqld' will span a new thread
to handle the request.  This thread will first check if the hostname is
in the hostname cache. If not the thread will call `gethostbyaddr_r()'
and `gethostbyname_r()' to resolve the hostname.

If the operating system doesn't support the above thread-safe calls, the
thread will lock a mutex and call `gethostbyaddr()' and
`gethostbyname()' instead. Note that in this case no other thread can
resolve other hostnames that is not in the hostname cache until the
first thread is ready.

You can disable DNS host lookup by starting `mysqld' with
`--skip-name-resolve'.  In this case you can however only use IP names
in the MySQL privilege tables.

If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you can get more
performance by either disabling DNS lookop with `--skip-name-resolve'
or by increasing the `HOST_CACHE_SIZE' define (default: 128) and
recompile `mysqld'.

You can disable the hostname cache with `--skip-host-cache'. You can
clear the hostname cache with `FLUSH HOSTS' or `mysqladmin flush-hosts'.

If you don't want to allow connections over `TCP/IP', you can do this
by starting `mysqld' with `--skip-networking'.


File: mysql.info,  Node: SET OPTION,  Prev: DNS,  Up: Optimizing the Server

`SET' Syntax
------------

     SET [OPTION] SQL_VALUE_OPTION= value, ...

`SET OPTION' sets various options that affect the operation of the
server or your client.  Any option you set remains in effect until the
current session ends, or until you set the option to a different value.

`CHARACTER SET character_set_name | DEFAULT'
     This maps all strings from and to the client with the given
     mapping.  Currently the only option for `character_set_name' is
     `cp1251_koi8', but you can easily add new mappings by editing the
     `sql/convert.cc' file in the MySQL source distribution.  The
     default mapping can be restored by using a `character_set_name'
     value of `DEFAULT'.

     Note that the syntax for setting the `CHARACTER SET' option differs
     from the syntax for setting the other options.

`PASSWORD = PASSWORD('some password')'
     Set the password for the current user. Any non-anonymous user can
     change his own password!

`PASSWORD FOR user = PASSWORD('some password')'
     Set the password for a specific user on the current server host.
     Only a user with access to the `mysql' database can do this.  The
     user should be given in `user@hostname' format, where `user' and
     `hostname' are exactly as they are listed in the `User' and `Host'
     columns of the `mysql.user' table entry.  For example, if you had
     an entry with `User' and `Host' fields of `'bob'' and
     `'%.loc.gov'', you would write:

          mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR bob@"%.loc.gov" = PASSWORD("newpass");
          
          or
          
          mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD("newpass") where user="bob' and host="%.loc.gov";

`SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1' (default) then one can find the last inserted row
     for a table with an auto_increment row with the following
     construct: `WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL'.  This is used by
     some ODBC programs like Access.

`AUTOCOMMIT= 0 | 1'
     If set to `1' all changes to a table will be done at once. To start
     a multi-command transaction, you have to use the `BEGIN'
     statement. *Note COMMIT::. If set to `0' you have to use `COMMIT' /
     `ROLLBACK' to accept/revoke that transaction. *Note COMMIT::.  Note
     that when you change from not `AUTOCOMMIT' mode to `AUTOCOMMIT'
     mode, MySQL will do an automatic `COMMIT' on any open transactions.

`SQL_BIG_TABLES = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1', all temporary tables are stored on disk rather than
     in memory.  This will be a little slower, but you will not get the
     error `The table tbl_name is full' for big `SELECT' operations that
     require a large temporary table.  The default value for a new
     connection is `0' (that is, use in-memory temporary tables).

`SQL_BIG_SELECTS = 0 | 1'
     If set to `0', MySQL will abort if a `SELECT' is attempted that
     probably will take a very long time. This is useful when an
     inadvisable `WHERE' statement has been issued. A big query is
     defined as a `SELECT' that probably will have to examine more than
     `max_join_size' rows.  The default value for a new connection is
     `1' (which will allow all `SELECT' statements).

`SQL_BUFFER_RESULT = 0 | 1'
     `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT' will force the result from `SELECT''s to be
     put into a temporary table. This will help MySQL free the table
     locks early and will help in cases where it takes a long time to
     send the result set to the client.

`SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1', all `INSERT', `UPDATE', `DELETE', and and `LOCK
     TABLE WRITE' statements wait until there is no pending `SELECT' or
     `LOCK TABLE READ' on the affected table.

`SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE = value | DEFAULT'
     Don't allow `SELECT's that will probably need to examine more than
     `value' row combinations.  By setting this value, you can catch
     `SELECT's where keys are not used properly and that would probably
     take a long time. Setting this to a value other than `DEFAULT'
     will reset the `SQL_BIG_SELECTS' flag.  If you set the
     `SQL_BIG_SELECTS' flag again, the `SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE' variable
     will be ignored.  You can set a default value for this variable by
     starting `mysqld' with `-O max_join_size=#'.

`SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1', MySQL will abort if an `UPDATE' or `DELETE' is
     attempted that doesn't use a key or `LIMIT' in the `WHERE' clause.
     This makes it possible to catch wrong updates when creating SQL
     commands by hand.

`SQL_SELECT_LIMIT = value | DEFAULT'
     The maximum number of records to return from `SELECT' statements.
     If a `SELECT' has a `LIMIT' clause, the `LIMIT' takes precedence
     over the value of `SQL_SELECT_LIMIT'.  The default value for a new
     connection is "unlimited." If you have changed the limit, the
     default value can be restored by using a `SQL_SELECT_LIMIT' value
     of `DEFAULT'.

`SQL_LOG_OFF = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1', no logging will be done to the standard log for this
     client, if the client has the *process* privilege.  This does not
     affect the update log!

`SQL_LOG_UPDATE = 0 | 1'
     If set to `0', no logging will be done to the update log for the
     client, if the client has the *process* privilege.  This does not
     affect the standard log!

`SQL_QUOTE_SHOW_CREATE = 0 | 1'
     If set to `1', `SHOW CREATE TABLE' will quote table and column
     names. This is *on* by default, for replication of tables with
     fancy column names to work.  *Note `SHOW CREATE TABLE': SHOW
     CREATE TABLE.

`TIMESTAMP = timestamp_value | DEFAULT'
     Set the time for this client.  This is used to get the original
     timestamp if you use the update log to restore rows.
     `timestamp_value' should be a UNIX Epoch timestamp, not a MySQL
     timestamp.

`LAST_INSERT_ID = #'
     Set the value to be returned from `LAST_INSERT_ID()'. This is
     stored in the update log when you use `LAST_INSERT_ID()' in a
     command that updates a table.

`INSERT_ID = #'
     Set the value to be used by the following `INSERT' or `ALTER TABLE'
     command when inserting an `AUTO_INCREMENT' value.  This is mainly
     used with the update log.

Disk Issues
===========

   * As mentioned before, disks seeks are a big performance bottleneck.
     This problems gets more and more apparent when the data starts to
     grow so large that effective caching becomes impossible. For large
     databases, where you access data more or less randomly, you can be
     sure that you will need at least one disk seek to read and a
     couple of disk seeks to write things. To minimize this problem,
     use disks with low seek times.

   * Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce
     the seek overhead) by either symlink files to different disks or
     striping the disks.

    *Using symbolic links*
          This means that you symlink the index and/or data file(s)
          from the normal data directory to another disk (that may also
          be striped). This makes both the seek and read times better
          (if the disks are not used for other things). *Note Symbolic
          links::.

    *Striping*
          Striping means that you have many disks and put the first
          block on the first disk, the second block on the second disk,
          and the Nth on the (N mod number_of_disks) disk, and so on.
          This means if your normal data size is less than the stripe
          size (or perfectly aligned) you will get much better
          performance. Note that striping is very dependent on the OS
          and stripe-size. So benchmark your application with different
          stripe-sizes. *Note Custom Benchmarks::.

          Note that the speed difference for striping is *very*
          dependent on the parameters. Depending on how you set the
          striping parameters and number of disks you may get a
          difference in orders of magnitude. Note that you have to
          choose to optimize for random or sequential access.

   * For reliability you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping +
     mirroring), but in this case you will need 2*N drives to hold N
     drives of data. This is probably the best option if you have the
     money for it!  You may, however, also have to invest in some
     volume-management software to handle it efficiently.

   * A good option is to have semi-important data (that can be
     regenerated) on RAID 0 disk while storing really important data
     (like host information and logs) on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk.
     RAID N can be a problem if you have many writes because of the
     time to update the parity bits.

   * You may also set the parameters for the file system that the
     database uses. One easy change is to mount the file system with
     the noatime option. That makes it skip the updating of the last
     access time in the inode and by this will avoid some disk seeks.

   * On Linux, you can get much more performance (up to 100 % under
     load is not uncommon) by using hdpram to configure your disk's
     interface!  The following should be quite good hdparm options for
     MySQL (and probably many other applications):

          hdparm -m 16 -d 1

     Note that the performance/reliability when using the above depends
     on your hardware, so we strongly suggest that you test your system
     thoroughly after using `hdparm'!  Please consult the `hdparm' man
     page for more information!  If `hdparm' is not used wisely,
     filesystem corruption may result.  Backup everything before
     experimenting!

   * On many operating systems you can mount the disks with the 'async'
     flag to set the file system to be updated asynchronously.  If your
     computer is reasonable stable, this should give you more
     performance without sacrificing too much reliability.  (This flag
     is on by default on Linux.)

   * If you don't need to know when a file was last accessed (which is
     not really useful on a database server), you can mount your file
     systems with the noatime flag.

Using Symbolic Links
--------------------

You can move tables and databases from the database directory to other
locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations.
You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file
system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by
spreading your tables to different disk.

The recommended may to do this, is to just symlink databases to
different disk and only symlink tables as a last resort.

* Menu:

* Symbolic links to databases::  Using Symbolic Links for Databases
* Symbolic links to tables::    Using Symbolic Links for Tables


File: mysql.info,  Node: Symbolic links to databases,  Next: Symbolic links to tables,  Prev: Symbolic links,  Up: Symbolic links

Using Symbolic Links for Databases
..................................

The way to symlink a database is to first create a directory on some
disk where you have free space and then create a symlink to it from the
MySQL database directory.

     shell> mkdir /dr1/databases/test
     shell> ln -s /dr1/databases/test mysqld-datadir

MySQL doesn't support that you link one directory to multiple
databases.  Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link will
work fine as long as you don't make a symbolic link between databases.
Suppose you have a database `db1' under the MySQL data directory, and
then make a symlink `db2' that points to `db1':

     shell> cd /path/to/datadir
     shell> ln -s db1 db2

Now, for any table `tbl_a' in `db1', there also appears to be a table
`tbl_a' in `db2'.  If one thread updates `db1.tbl_a' and another thread
updates `db2.tbl_a', there will be problems.

If you really need this, you must change the following code in
`mysys/mf_format.c':

     if (flag & 32 || (!lstat(to,&stat_buff) && S_ISLNK(stat_buff.st_mode)))

to

     if (1)

On Windows you can use internal symbolic links to directories by
compiling MySQL with `-DUSE_SYMDIR'. This allows you to put different
databases on different disks. *Note Windows symbolic links::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Symbolic links to tables,  Prev: Symbolic links to databases,  Up: Symbolic links

Using Symbolic Links for Tables
...............................

Before MySQL 4.0 you should not symlink tables, if you are not very
carefully with them. The problem is that if you run `ALTER TABLE',
`REPAIR TABLE' or `OPTIMIZE TABLE' on a symlinked table, the symlinks
will be removed and replaced by the original files. This happens
because the above command works by creating a temporary file in the
database directory and when the command is complete, replace the
original file with the temporary file.

You should not symlink tables on system that doesn't have a fully
working `realpath()' call. (At least Linux and Solaris support
`realpath()')

In MySQL 4.0 symlinks is only fully supported for `MyISAM' tables.  For
other table types you will probably get strange problems when doing any
of the above mentioned commands.

The handling of symbolic links in MySQL 4.0 works the following way
(this is mostly relevant only for `MyISAM' tables).

   * In the data directory you will always have the table definition
     file and the data/index files.

   * You can symlink the index file and the data file to different
     directories independent of the other.

   * The symlinking can be done from the operating system (if `mysqld'
     is not running) or with the `INDEX/DATA DIRECTORY="path-to-dir"'
     command in `CREATE TABLE'. *Note CREATE TABLE::.

   * `myisamchk' will not replace a symlink with the index/file but
     work directly on the files the symlinks points to. Any temporary
     files will be created in the same directory where the data/index
     file is.

   * When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and
     the file the symlink points to is dropped.  This is a good reason
     to why you should NOT run `mysqld' as root and not allow persons
     to have write access to the MySQL database directories.

   * If you rename a table with `ALTER TABLE RENAME' and you don't
     change database, the symlink in the database directory will be
     renamed to the new name and the data/index file will be renamed
     accordingly.

   * If you use `ALTER TABLE RENAME' to move a table to another
     database, then the table will be moved to the other database
     directory and the old symlinks and the files they pointed to will
     be deleted.

   * If you are not using symlinks you should use the `--skip-symlink'
     option to `mysqld' to ensure that no one can drop or rename a file
     outside of the `mysqld' data directory.

Things that are not yet supported:

   * `ALTER TABLE' ignores all `INDEX/DATA DIRECTORY="path"' options.

   * `CREATE TABLE' doesn't report if the table has symbolic links.

   * `mysqldump' doesn't include the symbolic links information in the
     output.

   * `BACKUP TABLE' and `RESTORE TABLE' don't respect symbolic links.

run into when dealing with these basic types in MySQL.


File: mysql.info,  Node: String syntax,  Next: Number syntax,  Prev: Literals,  Up: Literals

Strings
.......

A string is a sequence of characters, surrounded by either single quote
(`'') or double quote (`"') characters (only the single quote if you
run in ANSI mode).  Examples:

     'a string'
     "another string"

Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning.  Each of these
sequences begins with a backslash (`\'), known as the _escape
character_.  MySQL recognizes the following escape sequences:

`\0'
     An ASCII 0 (`NUL') character.

`\''
     A single quote (`'') character.

`\"'
     A double quote (`"') character.

`\b'
     A backspace character.

`\n'
     A newline character.

`\r'
     A carriage return character.

`\t'
     A tab character.

`\z'
     ASCII(26) (Control-Z).  This character can be encoded to allow you
     to go around the problem that ASCII(26) stands for END-OF-FILE on
     Windows.  (ASCII(26) will cause problems if you try to use `mysql
     database < filename').

`\\'
     A backslash (`\') character.

`\%'
     A `%' character. This is used to search for literal instances of
     `%' in contexts where `%' would otherwise be interpreted as a
     wild-card character. *Note String comparison functions::.

`\_'
     A `_' character. This is used to search for literal instances of
     `_' in contexts where `_' would otherwise be interpreted as a
     wild-card character. *Note String comparison functions::.

Note that if you use `\%' or `\_' in some string contexts, these will
return the strings `\%' and `\_' and not `%' and `_'.

There are several ways to include quotes within a string:

   * A `'' inside a string quoted with `'' may be written as `'''.

   * A `"' inside a string quoted with `"' may be written as `""'.

   * You can precede the quote character with an escape character (`\').

   * A `'' inside a string quoted with `"' needs no special treatment
     and need not be doubled or escaped.  In the same way, `"' inside a
     string quoted with `'' needs no special treatment.

The `SELECT' statements shown below demonstrate how quoting and
escaping work:

     mysql> SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
     +-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
     | hello | "hello" | ""hello"" | hel'lo | 'hello |
     +-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
     
     mysql> SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";
     +-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
     | hello | 'hello' | ''hello'' | hel"lo | "hello |
     +-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
     
     mysql> SELECT "This\nIs\nFour\nlines";
     +--------------------+
     | This
     Is
     Four
     lines |
     +--------------------+

If you want to insert binary data into a `BLOB' column, the following
characters must be represented by escape sequences:
`NUL'
     ASCII 0. You should represent this by `\0' (a backslash and an
     ASCII `0' character).

`\'
     ASCII 92, backslash.  Represent this by `\\'.

`''
     ASCII 39, single quote.  Represent this by `\''.

`"'
     ASCII 34, double quote.  Represent this by `\"'.

If you write C code, you can use the C API function
`mysql_escape_string()' to escape characters for the `INSERT'
statement.  *Note C API function overview::.  In Perl, you can use the
`quote' method of the `DBI' package to convert special characters to
the proper escape sequences.  *Note Perl `DBI' Class: Perl DBI Class.

You should use an escape function on any string that might contain any
of the special characters listed above!

Numbers
.......

Integers are represented as a sequence of digits. Floats use `.' as a
decimal separator.  Either type of number may be preceded by `-' to
indicate a negative value.

Examples of valid integers:

     1221
     0
     -32

Examples of valid floating-point numbers:

     294.42
     -32032.6809e+10
     148.00

An integer may be used in a floating-point context; it is interpreted
as the equivalent floating-point number.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Hexadecimal values,  Next: NULL values,  Prev: Number syntax,  Up: Literals

Hexadecimal Values
..................

MySQL supports hexadecimal values.  In number context these act like an
integer (64-bit precision). In string context these act like a binary
string where each pair of hex digits is converted to a character:

     mysql> SELECT 0xa+0;
            -> 10
     mysql> select 0x5061756c;
            -> Paul

Hexadecimal strings are often used by ODBC to give values for BLOB
columns.


File: mysql.info,  Node: NULL values,  Prev: Hexadecimal values,  Up: Literals

`NULL' Values
.............

The `NULL' value means "no data" and is different from values such as
`0' for numeric types or the empty string for string types.  *Note
Problems with `NULL': Problems with NULL.

`NULL' may be represented by `\N' when using the text file import or
export formats (`LOAD DATA INFILE', `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE').  *Note
`LOAD DATA': LOAD DATA.

Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names
-----------------------------------------------

* Menu:

* Name case sensitivity::       Case sensitivity in names

Database, table, index, column, and alias names all follow the same
rules in MySQL.

Note that the rules changed starting with MySQL Version 3.23.6 when we
introduced quoting of identifiers (database, table, and column names)
with ``'. `"' will also work to quote identifiers if you run in ANSI
mode. *Note ANSI mode::.

*Identifier**Max        *Allowed characters*
            length*     
Database    64          Any character that is allowed in a directory name
                        except `/' or `.'.
Table       64          Any character that is allowed in a file name,
                        except `/' or `.'.
Column      64          All characters.
Alias       255         All characters.

Note that in addition to the above, you can't have ASCII(0) or
ASCII(255) or the quoting character in an identifier.

Note that if the identifier is a restricted word or contains special
characters you must always quote it with ``' when you use it:

     SELECT * from `select` where `select`.id > 100;

In previous versions of MySQL, the name rules are as follows:

   * A name may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current
     character set and also `_' and `$'. The default character set is
     ISO-8859-1 Latin1; this may be changed with the
     `--default-character-set' option to `mysqld'.  *Note Character
     sets::.

   * A name may start with any character that is legal in a name.  In
     particular, a name may start with a number (this differs from many
     other database systems!).  However, a name cannot consist _only_
     of numbers.

   * You cannot use the `.' character in names because it is used to
     extend the format by which you can refer to columns (see
     immediately below).

It is recommended that you do not use names like `1e', because an
expression like `1e+1' is ambiguous. It may be interpreted as the
expression `1e + 1' or as the number `1e+1'.

In MySQL you can refer to a column using any of the following forms:

*Column reference*        *Meaning*
`col_name'                Column `col_name' from whichever table used in
                          the query contains a column of that name.
`tbl_name.col_name'       Column `col_name' from table `tbl_name' of the
                          current database.
`db_name.tbl_name.col_name'Column `col_name' from table `tbl_name' of the
                          database `db_name'.  This form is available in
                          MySQL Version 3.22 or later.
``column_name`'           A column that is a keyword or contains special
                          characters.

You need not specify a `tbl_name' or `db_name.tbl_name' prefix for a
column reference in a statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.
For example, suppose tables `t1' and `t2' each contain a column `c',
and you retrieve `c' in a `SELECT' statement that uses both `t1' and
`t2'.  In this case, `c' is ambiguous because it is not unique among
the tables used in the statement, so you must indicate which table you
mean by writing `t1.c' or `t2.c'.  Similarly, if you are retrieving
from a table `t' in database `db1' and from a table `t' in database
`db2', you must refer to columns in those tables as `db1.t.col_name'
and `db2.t.col_name'.

The syntax `.tbl_name' means the table `tbl_name' in the current
database.  This syntax is accepted for ODBC compatibility, because some
ODBC programs prefix table names with a `.' character.

Case Sensitivity in Names
-------------------------

In MySQL, databases and tables correspond to directories and files
within those directories.  Consequently, the case sensitivity of the
underlying operating system determines the case sensitivity of database
and table names.  This means database and table names are case
sensitive in Unix and case insensitive in Windows. *Note Extensions to
ANSI::.

*NOTE:* Although database and table names are case insensitive for
Windows, you should not refer to a given database or table using
different cases within the same query.  The following query would not
work because it refers to a table both as `my_table' and as `MY_TABLE':

     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;

Column names are case insensitive in all cases.

Aliases on tables are case sensitive.  The following query would not
work because it refers to the alias both as `a' and as `A':

     mysql> SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
                WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;

Aliases on columns are case insensitive.

If you have a problem remembering the used cases for a table names,
adopt a consistent convention, such as always creating databases and
tables using lowercase names.

One way to avoid this problem is to start `mysqld' with `-O
lower_case_table_names=1'. By default this option is 1 on Windows and 0
on Unix.

If `lower_case_table_names' is 1 MySQL will convert all table names to
lower case on storage and lookup.  Note that if you change this option,
you need to first convert your old table names to lower case before
starting `mysqld'.

User Variables
--------------

MySQL supports thread-specific variables with the `@variablename'
syntax.  A variable name may consist of alphanumeric characters from
the current character set and also `_', `$', and `.' . The default
character set is ISO-8859-1 Latin1; this may be changed with the
`--default-character-set' option to `mysqld'. *Note Character sets::.

Variables don't have to be initialized.  They contain `NULL' by default
and can store an integer, real, or string value.  All variables for a
thread are automatically freed when the thread exits.

You can set a variable with the `SET' syntax:

     SET @variable= { integer expression | real expression | string expression }
     [,@variable= ...].

You can also set a variable in an expression with the `@variable:=expr'
syntax:

     select @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;
     +----------------------+------+------+------+
     | @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4 | @t1  | @t2  | @t3  |
     +----------------------+------+------+------+
     |                    5 |    5 |    1 |    4 |
     +----------------------+------+------+------+

(We had to use the `:=' syntax here, because `=' was reserved for
comparisons.)

User variables may be used where expressions are allowed.  Note that
this does not currently include use in contexts where a number is
explicitly required, such as in the `LIMIT' clause of a `SELECT'
statement, or the `IGNORE number LINES' clause of a `LOAD DATA'
statement.

*NOTE:*  In a `SELECT' statement, each expression is only evaluated
when it's sent to the client.  This means that in the `HAVING', `GROUP
BY', or `ORDER BY' clause, you can't refer to an expression that
involves variables that are set in the `SELECT' part. For example, the
following statement will NOT work as expected:

     SELECT (@aa:=id) AS a, (@aa+3) AS b FROM table_name HAVING b=5;

The reason is that `@aa' will not contain the value of the current row,
but the value of `id' for the previous accepted row.

Comment Syntax
--------------

The MySQL server supports the `# to end of line', `-- to end of line'
and `/* in-line or multiple-line */' comment styles:

     mysql> select 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
     mysql> select 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
     mysql> select 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
     mysql> select 1+
     /*
     this is a
     multiple-line comment
     */
     1;

Note that the `--' comment style requires you to have at least one space
after the `--'!

Although the server understands the comment syntax just described,
there are some limitations on the way that the `mysql' client parses
`/* ... */' comments:

   * Single-quote and double-quote characters are taken to indicate the
     beginning of a quoted string, even within a comment.  If the quote
     is not matched by a second quote within the comment, the parser
     doesn't realize the comment has ended.  If you are running `mysql'
     interactively, you can tell that it has gotten confused like this
     because the prompt changes from `mysql>' to `'>' or `">'.

   * A semicolon is taken to indicate the end of the current SQL
     statement and anything following it to indicate the beginning of
     the next statement.

These limitations apply both when you run `mysql' interactively and
when you put commands in a file and tell `mysql' to read its input from
that file with `mysql < some-file'.

MySQL doesn't support the `--' ANSI SQL comment style.  *Note Missing
comments::.

Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?
------------------------------------

A common problem stems from trying to create a table with column names
that use the names of datatypes or functions built into MySQL, such as
`TIMESTAMP' or `GROUP'.  You're allowed to do it (for example, `ABS' is
an allowed column name), but whitespace is not allowed between a
function name and the `(' when using functions whose names are also
column names.

The following words are explicitly reserved in MySQL. Most of them are
forbidden by ANSI SQL92 as column and/or table names (for example,
`group').  A few are reserved because MySQL needs them and is
(currently) using a `yacc' parser:

`action'           `add'              `aggregate'        `all'
`alter'            `after'            `and'              `as'

Column Types
============

MySQL supports a number of column types, which may be grouped into
three categories: numeric types, date and time types, and string
(character) types.  This section first gives an overview of the types
available and summarizes the storage requirements for each column type,
then provides a more detailed description of the properties of the
types in each category.  The overview is intentionally brief.  The more
detailed descriptions should be consulted for additional information
about particular column types, such as the allowable formats in which
you can specify values.

The column types supported by MySQL are listed below.  The following
code letters are used in the descriptions:

`M'
     Indicates the maximum display size.  The maximum legal display
     size is 255.

`D'
     Applies to floating-point types and indicates the number of digits
     following the decimal point.  The maximum possible value is 30, but
     should be no greater than `M'-2.

Square brackets (`[' and `]') indicate parts of type specifiers that
are optional.

Note that if you specify `ZEROFILL' for a column, MySQL will
automatically add the `UNSIGNED' attribute to the column.

`TINYINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     A very small integer. The signed range is `-128' to `127'. The
     unsigned range is `0' to `255'.

`SMALLINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     A small integer. The signed range is `-32768' to `32767'. The
     unsigned range is `0' to `65535'.

`MEDIUMINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     A medium-size integer. The signed range is `-8388608' to
     `8388607'. The unsigned range is `0' to `16777215'.

`INT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     A normal-size integer. The signed range is `-2147483648' to
     `2147483647'.  The unsigned range is `0' to `4294967295'.

`INTEGER[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     This is a synonym for `INT'.

`BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]'
     A large integer. The signed range is `-9223372036854775808' to
     `9223372036854775807'. The unsigned range is `0' to
     `18446744073709551615'.

     Some things you should be aware about `BIGINT' columns:

        * As all arithmetic is done using signed `BIGINT' or `DOUBLE'
          values, so you shouldn't use unsigned big integers larger than
          `9223372036854775807' (63 bits) except with bit functions! If
          you do that, some of the last digits in the result may be
          wrong because of rounding errors when converting the `BIGINT'
          to a `DOUBLE'.

        * You can always store an exact integer value in a `BIGINT'
          column by storing it as a string, as there is in this case
          there will be no intermediate double representation.

        * `-', `+', and `*' will use `BIGINT' arithmetic when both
          arguments are `INTEGER' values!  This means that if you
          multiply two big integers (or results from functions that
          return integers) you may get unexpected results when the
          result is larger than `9223372036854775807'.

`FLOAT(precision) [ZEROFILL]'
     A floating-point number. Cannot be unsigned.  `precision' can be
     `<=24' for a single-precision floating-point number and between 25
     and 53 for a double-precision floating-point number. These types
     are like the `FLOAT' and `DOUBLE' types described immediately
     below.  `FLOAT(X)' has the same range as the corresponding `FLOAT'
     and `DOUBLE' types, but the display size and number of decimals is
     undefined.

     In MySQL Version 3.23, this is a true floating-point value.  In
     earlier MySQL versions, `FLOAT(precision)' always has 2 decimals.

     Note that using `FLOAT' may give you some unexpected problems as
     all calculation in MySQL is done with double precision.  *Note No
     matching rows::.

     This syntax is provided for ODBC compatibility.

`FLOAT[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]'
     A small (single-precision) floating-point number. Cannot be
     unsigned.  Allowable values are `-3.402823466E+38' to
     `-1.175494351E-38', `0', and `1.175494351E-38' to
     `3.402823466E+38'.  The M is the display width and D is the number
     of decimals.  `FLOAT' without an argument or with an argument of
     <= 24 stands for a single-precision floating-point number.

`DOUBLE[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]'
     A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number. Cannot be
     unsigned. Allowable values are `-1.7976931348623157E+308' to
     `-2.2250738585072014E-308', `0', and `2.2250738585072014E-308' to
     `1.7976931348623157E+308'.  The M is the display width and D is
     the number of decimals.  `DOUBLE' without an argument or
     `FLOAT(X)' where 25 <= X <= 53 stands for a double-precision
     floating-point number.

`DOUBLE PRECISION[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]'
`REAL[(M,D)] [ZEROFILL]'
     These are synonyms for `DOUBLE'.

`DECIMAL[(M[,D])] [ZEROFILL]'
     An unpacked floating-point number.  Cannot be unsigned.  Behaves
     like a `CHAR' column: "unpacked" means the number is stored as a
     string, using one character for each digit of the value.  The
     decimal point and, for negative numbers, the `-' sign, are not
     counted in M (but space for these are reserved). If `D' is 0,
     values will have no decimal point or fractional part.  The maximum
     range of `DECIMAL' values is the same as for `DOUBLE', but the
     actual range for a given `DECIMAL' column may be constrained by
     the choice of `M' and `D'.

     If `D' is left out it's set to 0. If `M' is left out it's set to
     10.

     Note that in MySQL Version 3.22 the `M' argument had to includes
     the space needed for the sign and the decimal point.

`NUMERIC(M,D) [ZEROFILL]'
     This is a synonym for `DECIMAL'.

`DATE'
     A date.  The supported range is `'1000-01-01'' to `'9999-12-31''.
     MySQL displays `DATE' values in `'YYYY-MM-DD'' format, but allows
     you to assign values to `DATE' columns using either strings or
     numbers. *Note DATETIME::.

`DATETIME'
     A date and time combination.  The supported range is `'1000-01-01
     00:00:00'' to `'9999-12-31 23:59:59''.  MySQL displays `DATETIME'
     values in `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'' format, but allows you to assign
     values to `DATETIME' columns using either strings or numbers.
     *Note DATETIME::.

`TIMESTAMP[(M)]'
     A timestamp.  The range is `'1970-01-01 00:00:00'' to sometime in
     the year `2037'.  MySQL displays `TIMESTAMP' values in
     `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS', `YYMMDDHHMMSS', `YYYYMMDD', or `YYMMDD' format,
     depending on whether `M' is `14' (or missing), `12', `8', or `6',
     but allows you to assign values to `TIMESTAMP' columns using
     either strings or numbers.  A `TIMESTAMP' column is useful for
     recording the date and time of an `INSERT' or `UPDATE' operation
     because it is automatically set to the date and time of the most
     recent operation if you don't give it a value yourself.  You can
     also set it to the current date and time by assigning it a `NULL'
     value.  *Note Date and time types::.

     A `TIMESTAMP' is always stored in 4 bytes.  The `M' argument only
     affects how the `TIMESTAMP' column is displayed.

     Note that `TIMESTAMP(X)' columns where X is 8 or 14 are reported to
     be numbers while other `TIMESTAMP(X)' columns are reported to be
     strings.  This is just to ensure that one can reliably dump and
     restore the table with these types!  *Note DATETIME::.

`TIME'
     A time.  The range is `'-838:59:59'' to `'838:59:59''.  MySQL
     displays `TIME' values in `'HH:MM:SS'' format, but allows you to
     assign values to `TIME' columns using either strings or numbers.
     *Note TIME::.

`YEAR[(2|4)]'
     A year in 2- or 4-digit format (default is 4-digit).  The
     allowable values are `1901' to `2155', `0000' in the 4-digit year
     format, and 1970-2069 if you use the 2-digit format (70-69).
     MySQL displays `YEAR' values in `YYYY' format, but allows you to
     assign values to `YEAR' columns using either strings or numbers.
     (The `YEAR' type is new in MySQL Version 3.22.). *Note YEAR::.

`[NATIONAL] CHAR(M) [BINARY]'
     A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to
     the specified length when stored. The range of `M' is 1 to 255
     characters.  Trailing spaces are removed when the value is
     retrieved. `CHAR' values are sorted and compared in
     case-insensitive fashion according to the default character set
     unless the `BINARY' keyword is given.

     `NATIONAL CHAR' (short form `NCHAR') is the ANSI SQL way to define
     that a CHAR column should use the default CHARACTER set.  This is
     the default in MySQL.

     `CHAR' is a shorthand for `CHARACTER'.

     MySQL allows you to create a column of type `CHAR(0)'. This is
     mainly useful when you have to be compliant with some old
     applications that depend on the existence of a column but that do
     not actually use the value.  This is also quite nice when you need
     a column that only can take 2 values: A `CHAR(0)', that is not
     defined as `NOT NULL', will only occupy one bit and can only take
     2 values: `NULL' or `""'. *Note CHAR::.

Numeric Types
-------------

MySQL supports all of the ANSI/ISO SQL92 numeric types.  These types
include the exact numeric data types (`NUMERIC', `DECIMAL', `INTEGER',
and `SMALLINT'), as well as the approximate numeric data types
(`FLOAT', `REAL', and `DOUBLE PRECISION'). The keyword `INT' is a
synonym for `INTEGER', and the keyword `DEC' is a synonym for `DECIMAL'.

The `NUMERIC' and `DECIMAL' types are implemented as the same type by
MySQL, as permitted by the SQL92 standard.  They are used for values
for which it is important to preserve exact precision, for example with
monetary data.  When declaring a column of one of these types the
precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified; for example:

         salary DECIMAL(9,2)

In this example, `9' (`precision') represents the number of significant
decimal digits that will be stored for values, and `2' (`scale')
represents the number of digits that will be stored following the
decimal point.  In this case, therefore, the range of values that can
be stored in the `salary' column is from `-9999999.99' to `9999999.99'.
(MySQL can actually store numbers up to `9999999.99' in this column
because it doesn't have to store the sign for positive numbers)

In ANSI/ISO SQL92, the syntax `DECIMAL(p)' is equivalent to
`DECIMAL(p,0)'.  Similarly, the syntax `DECIMAL' is equivalent to
`DECIMAL(p,0)', where the implementation is allowed to decide the value
of `p'.  MySQL does not currently support either of these variant forms
of the `DECIMAL'/`NUMERIC' data types.  This is not generally a serious
problem, as the principal benefits of these types derive from the
ability to control both precision and scale explicitly.

`DECIMAL' and `NUMERIC' values are stored as strings, rather than as
binary floating-point numbers, in order to preserve the decimal
precision of those values.  One character is used for each digit of the
value, the decimal point (if `scale' > 0), and the `-' sign (for
negative numbers).  If `scale' is 0, `DECIMAL' and `NUMERIC' values
contain no decimal point or fractional part.

The maximum range of `DECIMAL' and `NUMERIC' values is the same as for
`DOUBLE', but the actual range for a given `DECIMAL' or `NUMERIC'
column can be constrained by the `precision' or `scale' for a given
column.  When such a column is assigned a value with more digits
following the decimal point than are allowed by the specified `scale',
the value is rounded to that `scale'.  When a `DECIMAL' or `NUMERIC'
column is assigned a value whose magnitude exceeds the range implied by
the specified (or defaulted) `precision' and `scale', MySQL stores the
value representing the corresponding end point of that range.

As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, MySQL also supports the
integral types `TINYINT', `MEDIUMINT', and `BIGINT' as listed in the
tables above.  Another extension is supported by MySQL for optionally
specifying the display width of an integral value in parentheses
following the base keyword for the type (for example, `INT(4)').  This
optional width specification is used to left-pad the display of values
whose width is less than the width specified for the column, but does
not constrain the range of values that can be stored in the column, nor
the number of digits that will be displayed for values whose width
exceeds that specified for the column.  When used in conjunction with
the optional extension attribute `ZEROFILL', the default padding of
spaces is replaced with zeroes.  For example, for a column declared as
`INT(5) ZEROFILL', a value of `4' is retrieved as `00004'.  Note that
if you store larger values than the display width in an integer column,
you may experience problems when MySQL generates temporary tables for
some complicated joins, as in these cases MySQL trusts that the data
did fit into the original column width.

All integral types can have an optional (non-standard) attribute
`UNSIGNED'.  Unsigned values can be used when you want to allow only
positive numbers in a column and you need a little bigger numeric range
for the column.

The `FLOAT' type is used to represent approximate numeric data types.
The ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard allows an optional specification of the
precision (but not the range of the exponent) in bits following the
keyword `FLOAT' in parentheses.  The MySQL implementation also supports
this optional precision specification.  When the keyword `FLOAT' is
used for a column type without a precision specification, MySQL uses
four bytes to store the values.  A variant syntax is also supported,
with two numbers given in parentheses following the `FLOAT' keyword.
With this option, the first number continues to represent the storage
requirements for the value in bytes, and the second number specifies
the number of digits to be stored and displayed following the decimal
point (as with `DECIMAL' and `NUMERIC').  When MySQL is asked to store
a number for such a column with more decimal digits following the
decimal point than specified for the column, the value is rounded to
eliminate the extra digits when the value is stored.

The `REAL' and `DOUBLE PRECISION' types do not accept precision
specifications.  As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, MySQL
recognizes `DOUBLE' as a synonym for the `DOUBLE PRECISION' type.  In
contrast with the standard's requirement that the precision for `REAL'
be smaller than that used for `DOUBLE PRECISION', MySQL implements both
as 8-byte double-precision floating-point values (when not running in
"ANSI mode").  For maximum portability, code requiring storage of
approximate numeric data values should use `FLOAT' or `DOUBLE
PRECISION' with no specification of precision or number of decimal
points.

When asked to store a value in a numeric column that is outside the
column type's allowable range, MySQL clips the value to the appropriate
endpoint of the range and stores the resulting value instead.

For example, the range of an `INT' column is `-2147483648' to
`2147483647'.  If you try to insert `-9999999999' into an `INT' column,
the value is clipped to the lower endpoint of the range, and
`-2147483648' is stored instead. Similarly, if you try to insert
`9999999999', `2147483647' is stored instead.

If the `INT' column is `UNSIGNED', the size of the column's range is
the same but its endpoints shift up to `0' and `4294967295'.  If you
try to store `-9999999999' and `9999999999', the values stored in the
column become `0' and `4294967296'.

Conversions that occur due to clipping are reported as "warnings" for
`ALTER TABLE', `LOAD DATA INFILE', `UPDATE', and multi-row `INSERT'
statements.

Date and Time Types
-------------------

* Menu:

* Y2K issues::                  Y2K issues and date types
* DATETIME::                    The `DATETIME', `DATE' and `TIMESTAMP' types
* TIME::                        The `TIME' type
* YEAR::                        The `YEAR' type

The date and time types are `DATETIME', `DATE', `TIMESTAMP', `TIME',
and `YEAR'.  Each of these has a range of legal values, as well as a
"zero" value that is used when you specify a really illegal value.
Note that MySQL allows you to store certain 'not strictly' legal date
values, for example `1999-11-31'.  The reason for this is that we think
it's the responsibility of the application to handle date checking, not
the SQL servers.  To make the date checking 'fast', MySQL only checks
that the month is in the range of 0-12 and the day is in the range of
0-31. The above ranges are defined this way because MySQL allows you to
store, in a `DATE' or `DATETIME' column, dates where the day or
month-day is zero.  This is extremely useful for applications that need
to store a birth-date for which you don't know the exact date. In this
case you simply store the date like `1999-00-00' or `1999-01-00'.  (You
cannot expect to get a correct value from functions like `DATE_SUB()'
or `DATE_ADD' for dates like these.)

Here are some general considerations to keep in mind when working with
date and time types:

   * MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a standard
     format, but it attempts to interpret a variety of formats for
     values that you supply (for example, when you specify a value to
     be assigned to or compared to a date or time type).  Nevertheless,
     only the formats described in the following sections are
     supported.  It is expected that you will supply legal values, and
     unpredictable results may occur if you use values in other formats.

   * Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats, it
     always expects the year part of date values to be leftmost.  Dates
     must be given in year-month-day order (for example, `'98-09-04''),
     rather than in the month-day-year or day-month-year orders
     commonly used elsewhere (for example, `'09-04-98'', `'04-09-98'').

   * MySQL automatically converts a date or time type value to a number
     if the value is used in a numeric context, and vice versa.

   * When MySQL encounters a value for a date or time type that is out
     of range or otherwise illegal for the type (see the start of this
     section), it converts the value to the "zero" value for that type.
     (The exception is that out-of-range `TIME' values are clipped to
     the appropriate endpoint of the `TIME' range.)  The table below
     shows the format of the "zero" value for each type:

     *Column type*        *"Zero" value*
     `DATETIME'           `'0000-00-00 00:00:00''
     `DATE'               `'0000-00-00''
     `TIMESTAMP'          `00000000000000' (length depends on display
                          size)
     `TIME'               `'00:00:00''
     `YEAR'               `0000'

   * The "zero" values are special, but you can store or refer to them
     explicitly using the values shown in the table.  You can also do
     this using the values `'0'' or `0', which are easier to write.

   * "Zero" date or time values used through *MyODBC* are converted
     automatically to `NULL' in *MyODBC* Version 2.50.12 and above,
     because ODBC can't handle such values.

Y2K Issues and Date Types
.........................

MySQL itself is Y2K-safe (*note Year 2000 compliance::), but input
values presented to MySQL may not be.  Any input containing 2-digit
year values is ambiguous, because the century is unknown.  Such values
must be interpreted into 4-digit form because MySQL stores years
internally using four digits.

For `DATETIME', `DATE', `TIMESTAMP', and `YEAR' types, MySQL interprets
dates with ambiguous year values using the following rules:

   * Year values in the range `00-69' are converted to `2000-2069'.

   * Year values in the range `70-99' are converted to `1970-1999'.

Remember that these rules provide only reasonable guesses as to what
your data mean.  If the heuristics used by MySQL don't produce the
correct values, you should provide unambiguous input containing 4-digit
year values.

`ORDER BY' will sort 2-digit `YEAR/DATE/DATETIME' types properly.

Note also that some functions like `MIN()' and `MAX()' will convert a
`TIMESTAMP/DATE' to a number. This means that a timestamp with a
2-digit year will not work properly with these functions.  The fix in
this case is to convert the `TIMESTAMP/DATE' to 4-digit year format or
use something like `MIN(DATE_ADD(timestamp,INTERVAL 0 DAYS))'.

The `DATETIME', `DATE', and `TIMESTAMP' Types
.............................................

The `DATETIME', `DATE', and `TIMESTAMP' types are related.  This
section describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ.

The `DATETIME' type is used when you need values that contain both date
and time information.  MySQL retrieves and displays `DATETIME' values
in `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'' format.  The supported range is `'1000-01-01
00:00:00'' to `'9999-12-31 23:59:59''.  ("Supported" means that
although earlier values might work, there is no guarantee that they
will.)

The `DATE' type is used when you need only a date value, without a time
part.  MySQL retrieves and displays `DATE' values in `'YYYY-MM-DD''
format.  The supported range is `'1000-01-01'' to `'9999-12-31''.

The `TIMESTAMP' column type provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark `INSERT' or `UPDATE' operations with the current
date and time.  If you have multiple `TIMESTAMP' columns, only the first
one is updated automatically.

Automatic updating of the first `TIMESTAMP' column occurs under any of
the following conditions:

   * The column is not specified explicitly in an `INSERT' or `LOAD
     DATA INFILE' statement.

   * The column is not specified explicitly in an `UPDATE' statement
     and some other column changes value.  (Note that an `UPDATE' that
     sets a column to the value it already has will not cause the
     `TIMESTAMP' column to be updated, because if you set a column to
     its current value, MySQL ignores the update for efficiency.)

   * You explicitly set the `TIMESTAMP' column to `NULL'.

`TIMESTAMP' columns other than the first may also be set to the current
date and time.  Just set the column to `NULL' or to `NOW()'.

You can set any `TIMESTAMP' column to a value different than the current
date and time by setting it explicitly to the desired value.  This is
true even for the first `TIMESTAMP' column.  You can use this property
if, for example, you want a `TIMESTAMP' to be set to the current date
and time when you create a row, but not to be changed whenever the row
is updated later:

   * Let MySQL set the column when the row is created.  This will
     initialize it to the current date and time.

   * When you perform subsequent updates to other columns in the row,
     set the `TIMESTAMP' column explicitly to its current value.

On the other hand, you may find it just as easy to use a `DATETIME'
column that you initialize to `NOW()' when the row is created and leave
alone for subsequent updates.

`TIMESTAMP' values may range from the beginning of 1970 to sometime in
the year 2037, with a resolution of one second.  Values are displayed as
numbers.

The format in which MySQL retrieves and displays `TIMESTAMP' values
depends on the display size, as illustrated by the table below.  The
`full' `TIMESTAMP' format is 14 digits, but `TIMESTAMP' columns may be
created with shorter display sizes:

*Column type*          *Display format*
`TIMESTAMP(14)'        `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'
`TIMESTAMP(12)'        `YYMMDDHHMMSS'
`TIMESTAMP(10)'        `YYMMDDHHMM'
`TIMESTAMP(8)'         `YYYYMMDD'
`TIMESTAMP(6)'         `YYMMDD'
`TIMESTAMP(4)'         `YYMM'
`TIMESTAMP(2)'         `YY'

All `TIMESTAMP' columns have the same storage size, regardless of
display size.  The most common display sizes are 6, 8, 12, and 14.  You
can specify an arbitrary display size at table creation time, but
values of 0 or greater than 14 are coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in
the range from 1 to 13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

You can specify `DATETIME', `DATE', and `TIMESTAMP' values using any of
a common set of formats:

   * As a string in either `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'' or `'YY-MM-DD
     HH:MM:SS'' format.  A "relaxed" syntax is allowed--any punctuation
     character may be used as the delimiter between date parts or time
     parts.  For example, `'98-12-31 11:30:45'', `'98.12.31 11+30+45'',
     `'98/12/31 11*30*45'', and `'98@12@31 11^30^45'' are equivalent.

   * As a string in either `'YYYY-MM-DD'' or `'YY-MM-DD'' format.  A
     "relaxed" syntax is allowed here, too.  For example, `'98-12-31'',
     `'98.12.31'', `'98/12/31'', and `'98@12@31'' are equivalent.

   * As a string with no delimiters in either `'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'' or
     `'YYMMDDHHMMSS'' format, provided that the string makes sense as a
     date.  For example, `'19970523091528'' and `'970523091528'' are
     interpreted as `'1997-05-23 09:15:28'', but `'971122129015'' is
     illegal (it has a nonsensical minute part) and becomes `'0000-00-00
     00:00:00''.

   * As a string with no delimiters in either `'YYYYMMDD'' or `'YYMMDD''
     format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.  For
     example, `'19970523'' and `'970523'' are interpreted as
     `'1997-05-23'', but `'971332'' is illegal (it has nonsensical month
     and day parts) and becomes `'0000-00-00''.

   * As a number in either `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or `YYMMDDHHMMSS' format,
     provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
     `19830905132800' and `830905132800' are interpreted as
     `'1983-09-05 13:28:00''.

   * As a number in either `YYYYMMDD' or `YYMMDD' format, provided that
     the number makes sense as a date.  For example, `19830905' and
     `830905' are interpreted as `'1983-09-05''.

   * As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
     in a `DATETIME', `DATE', or `TIMESTAMP' context, such as `NOW()'
     or `CURRENT_DATE'.

Illegal `DATETIME', `DATE', or `TIMESTAMP' values are converted to the
"zero" value of the appropriate type (`'0000-00-00 00:00:00'',
`'0000-00-00'', or `00000000000000').

For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it
is not necessary to specify two digits for month or day values that are
less than `10'.  `'1979-6-9'' is the same as `'1979-06-09''.  Similarly,
for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it
is not necessary to specify two digits for hour, month, or second
values that are less than `10'.  `'1979-10-30 1:2:3'' is the same as
`'1979-10-30 01:02:03''.

Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits long.  If
the number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in `YYYYMMDD' or
`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' format and that the year is given by the first 4
digits.  If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in
`YYMMDD' or `YYMMDDHHMMSS' format and that the year is given by the
first 2 digits.  Numbers that are not one of these lengths are
interpreted as though padded with leading zeros to the closest length.

Values specified as non-delimited strings are interpreted using their
length as given.  If the string is 8 or 14 characters long, the year is
assumed to be given by the first 4 characters.  Otherwise the year is
assumed to be given by the first 2 characters.  The string is
interpreted from left to right to find year, month, day, hour, minute,
and second values, for as many parts as are present in the string.
This means you should not use strings that have fewer than 6
characters.  For example, if you specify `'9903'', thinking that will
represent March, 1999, you will find that MySQL inserts a "zero" date
into your table.  This is because the year and month values are `99'
and `03', but the day part is missing (zero), so the value is not a
legal date.

`TIMESTAMP' columns store legal values using the full precision with
which the value was specified, regardless of the display size.  This has
several implications:

   * Always specify year, month, and day, even if your column types are
     `TIMESTAMP(4)' or `TIMESTAMP(2)'.  Otherwise, the value will not
     be a legal date and `0' will be stored.

   * If you use `ALTER TABLE' to widen a narrow `TIMESTAMP' column,
     information will be displayed that previously was "hidden".

   * Similarly, narrowing a `TIMESTAMP' column does not cause
     information to be lost, except in the sense that less information
     is shown when the values are displayed.

   * Although `TIMESTAMP' values are stored to full precision, the only
     function that operates directly on the underlying stored value is
     `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()'.  Other functions operate on the formatted
     retrieved value.  This means you cannot use functions such as
     `HOUR()' or `SECOND()' unless the relevant part of the `TIMESTAMP'
     value is included in the formatted value.  For example, the `HH'
     part of a `TIMESTAMP' column is not displayed unless the display
     size is at least 10, so trying to use `HOUR()' on shorter
     `TIMESTAMP' values produces a meaningless result.

You can to some extent assign values of one date type to an object of a
different date type.  However, there may be some alteration of the
value or loss of information:

   * If you assign a `DATE' value to a `DATETIME' or `TIMESTAMP'
     object, the time part of the resulting value is set to
     `'00:00:00'', because the `DATE' value contains no time
     information.

   * If you assign a `DATETIME' or `TIMESTAMP' value to a `DATE'
     object, the time part of the resulting value is deleted, because
     the `DATE' type stores no time information.

   * Remember that although `DATETIME', `DATE', and `TIMESTAMP' values
     all can be specified using the same set of formats, the types do
     not all have the same range of values.  For example, `TIMESTAMP'
     values cannot be earlier than `1970' or later than `2037'.  This
     means that a date such as `'1968-01-01'', while legal as a
     `DATETIME' or `DATE' value, is not a valid `TIMESTAMP' value and
     will be converted to `0' if assigned to such an object.

Be aware of certain pitfalls when specifying date values:

   * The relaxed format allowed for values specified as strings can be
     deceiving.  For example, a value such as `'10:11:12'' might look
     like a time value because of the `:' delimiter, but if used in a
     date context will be interpreted as the year `'2010-11-12''.  The
     value `'10:45:15'' will be converted to `'0000-00-00'' because
     `'45'' is not a legal month.

   * Year values specified as two digits are ambiguous, because the
     century is unknown.  MySQL interprets 2-digit year values using
     the following rules:

        - Year values in the range `00-69' are converted to `2000-2069'.

        - Year values in the range `70-99' are converted to `1970-1999'.

The `TIME' Type
...............

MySQL retrieves and displays `TIME' values in `'HH:MM:SS'' format (or
`'HHH:MM:SS'' format for large hours values).  `TIME' values may range
from `'-838:59:59'' to `'838:59:59''.  The reason the hours part may be
so large is that the `TIME' type may be used not only to represent a
time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also elapsed time
or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater than
24 hours, or even negative).

You can specify `TIME' values in a variety of formats:

   * As a string in `'D HH:MM:SS.fraction'' format.  (Note that MySQL
     doesn't yet store the fraction for the time column).  One can also
     use one of the following "relaxed" syntax:

     `HH:MM:SS.fraction', `HH:MM:SS', `HH:MM', `D HH:MM:SS', `D HH:MM',
     `D HH' or `SS'.  Here `D' is days between 0-33.

   * As a string with no delimiters in `'HHMMSS'' format, provided that
     it makes sense as a time.  For example, `'101112'' is understood as
     `'10:11:12'', but `'109712'' is illegal (it has a nonsensical
     minute part) and becomes `'00:00:00''.

   * As a number in `HHMMSS' format, provided that it makes sense as a
     time.  For example, `101112' is understood as `'10:11:12''.  The
     following alternative formats are also understood: `SS',
     `MMSS',`HHMMSS', `HHMMSS.fraction'.  Note that MySQL doesn't yet
     store the fraction part.

   * As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
     in a `TIME' context, such as `CURRENT_TIME'.

For `TIME' values specified as strings that include a time part
delimiter, it is not necessary to specify two digits for hours,
minutes, or seconds values that are less than `10'.  `'8:3:2'' is the
same as `'08:03:02''.

Be careful about assigning "short" `TIME' values to a `TIME' column.
Without semicolon, MySQL interprets values using the assumption that
the rightmost digits represent seconds. (MySQL interprets `TIME' values
as elapsed time rather than as time of day.) For example, you might
think of `'1112'' and `1112' as meaning `'11:12:00'' (12 minutes after
11 o'clock), but MySQL interprets them as `'00:11:12'' (11 minutes, 12
seconds).  Similarly, `'12'' and `12' are interpreted as `'00:00:12''.
`TIME' values with semicolon, instead, are always treated as time of
the day. That is `'11:12'' will mean `'11:12:00'', not `'00:11:12''.

Values that lie outside the `TIME' range but are otherwise legal are
clipped to the appropriate endpoint of the range.  For example,
`'-850:00:00'' and `'850:00:00'' are converted to `'-838:59:59'' and
`'838:59:59''.

Illegal `TIME' values are converted to `'00:00:00''.  Note that because
`'00:00:00'' is itself a legal `TIME' value, there is no way to tell,
from a value of `'00:00:00'' stored in a table, whether the original
value was specified as `'00:00:00'' or whether it was illegal.

The `YEAR' Type
...............

The `YEAR' type is a 1-byte type used for representing years.

MySQL retrieves and displays `YEAR' values in `YYYY' format.  The range
is `1901' to `2155'.

You can specify `YEAR' values in a variety of formats:

   * As a four-digit string in the range `'1901'' to `'2155''.

   * As a four-digit number in the range `1901' to `2155'.

   * As a two-digit string in the range `'00'' to `'99''.  Values in the
     ranges `'00'' to `'69'' and `'70'' to `'99'' are converted to
     `YEAR' values in the ranges `2000' to `2069' and `1970' to `1999'.

   * As a two-digit number in the range `1' to `99'.  Values in the
     ranges `1' to `69' and `70' to `99' are converted to `YEAR' values
     in the ranges `2001' to `2069' and `1970' to `1999'.  Note that
     the range for two-digit numbers is slightly different than the
     range for two-digit strings, because you cannot specify zero
     directly as a number and have it be interpreted as `2000'.  You
     _must_ specify it as a string `'0'' or `'00'' or it will be
     interpreted as `0000'.

   * As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
     in a `YEAR' context, such as `NOW()'.

Illegal `YEAR' values are converted to `0000'.

String Types
------------

* Menu:

* CHAR::                        The `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' types
* BLOB::                        The `BLOB' and `TEXT' types
* ENUM::                        The `ENUM' type
* SET::                         The `SET' type

The string types are `CHAR', `VARCHAR', `BLOB', `TEXT', `ENUM', and
`SET'.  This section describes how these types work, their storage
requirements, and how to use them in your queries.


File: mysql.info,  Node: CHAR,  Next: BLOB,  Prev: String types,  Up: String types

The `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' Types
..............................

The `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' types are similar, but differ in the way they
are stored and retrieved.

The length of a `CHAR' column is fixed to the length that you declare
when you create the table.  The length can be any value between 1 and
255.  (As of MySQL Version 3.23, the length of `CHAR' may be 0 to 255.)
When `CHAR' values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length.  When `CHAR' values are retrieved, trailing spaces are
removed.

Values in `VARCHAR' columns are variable-length strings.  You can
declare a `VARCHAR' column to be any length between 1 and 255, just as
for `CHAR' columns.  However, in contrast to `CHAR', `VARCHAR' values
are stored using only as many characters as are needed, plus one byte
to record the length.  Values are not padded; instead, trailing spaces
are removed when values are stored.  (This space removal differs from
the ANSI SQL specification.)

If you assign a value to a `CHAR' or `VARCHAR' column that exceeds the
column's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

The table below illustrates the differences between the two types of
columns by showing the result of storing various string values into
`CHAR(4)' and `VARCHAR(4)' columns:

*Value*        `CHAR(4)'   *Storage       `VARCHAR(4)'   *Storage required*
                           required*                     
`'''           `'    ''    4 bytes        `'''           1 byte
`'ab''         `'ab  ''    4 bytes        `'ab''         3 bytes
`'abcd''       `'abcd''    4 bytes        `'abcd''       5 bytes
`'abcdefgh''   `'abcd''    4 bytes        `'abcd''       5 bytes

The values retrieved from the `CHAR(4)' and `VARCHAR(4)' columns will
be the same in each case, because trailing spaces are removed from
`CHAR' columns upon retrieval.

Values in `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' columns are sorted and compared in
case-insensitive fashion, unless the `BINARY' attribute was specified
when the table was created.  The `BINARY' attribute means that column
values are sorted and compared in case-sensitive fashion according to
the ASCII order of the machine where the MySQL server is running.
`BINARY' doesn't affect how the column is stored or retrieved.

The `BINARY' attribute is sticky.  This means that if a column marked
`BINARY' is used in an expression, the whole expression is compared as a
`BINARY' value.

MySQL may silently change the type of a `CHAR' or `VARCHAR' column at
table creation time.  *Note Silent column changes::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: BLOB,  Next: ENUM,  Prev: CHAR,  Up: String types

The `BLOB' and `TEXT' Types
...........................

A `BLOB' is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of
data.  The four `BLOB' types `TINYBLOB', `BLOB', `MEDIUMBLOB', and
`LONGBLOB' differ only in the maximum length of the values they can
hold.  *Note Storage requirements::.

The four `TEXT' types `TINYTEXT', `TEXT', `MEDIUMTEXT', and `LONGTEXT'
correspond to the four `BLOB' types and have the same maximum lengths
and storage requirements.  The only difference between `BLOB' and
`TEXT' types is that sorting and comparison is performed in
case-sensitive fashion for `BLOB' values and case-insensitive fashion
for `TEXT' values.  In other words, a `TEXT' is a case-insensitive
`BLOB'.

If you assign a value to a `BLOB' or `TEXT' column that exceeds the
column type's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

In most respects, you can regard a `TEXT' column as a `VARCHAR' column
that can be as big as you like.  Similarly, you can regard a `BLOB'
column as a `VARCHAR BINARY' column.  The differences are:

   * You can have indexes on `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns with MySQL
     Version 3.23.2 and newer. Older versions of MySQL did not support
     this.

   * There is no trailing-space removal for `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns
     when values are stored, as there is for `VARCHAR' columns.

   * `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns cannot have `DEFAULT' values.

*MyODBC* defines `BLOB' values as `LONGVARBINARY' and `TEXT' values as
`LONGVARCHAR'.

Because `BLOB' and `TEXT' values may be extremely long, you may run up
against some constraints when using them:

   * If you want to use `GROUP BY' or `ORDER BY' on a `BLOB' or `TEXT'
     column, you must convert the column value into a fixed-length
     object. The standard way to do this is with the `SUBSTRING'
     function.  For example:

          mysql> select comment from tbl_name,substring(comment,20) as substr
                 ORDER BY substr;

     If you don't do this, only the first `max_sort_length' bytes of the
     column are used when sorting.  The default value of
     `max_sort_length' is 1024; this value can be changed using the
     `-O' option when starting the `mysqld' server. You can group on an
     expression involving `BLOB' or `TEXT' values by specifying the
     column position or by using an alias:

          mysql> select id,substring(blob_col,1,100) from tbl_name
                     GROUP BY 2;
          mysql> select id,substring(blob_col,1,100) as b from tbl_name
                     GROUP BY b;

   * The maximum size of a `BLOB' or `TEXT' object is determined by its
     type, but the largest value you can actually transmit between the
     client and server is determined by the amount of available memory
     and the size of the communications buffers.  You can change the
     message buffer size, but you must do so on both the server and
     client ends. *Note Server parameters::.

Note that each `BLOB' or `TEXT' value is represented internally by a
separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all other column
types, for which storage is allocated once per column when the table is
opened.


File: mysql.info,  Node: ENUM,  Next: SET,  Prev: BLOB,  Up: String types

The `ENUM' Type
...............

An `ENUM' is a string object whose value normally is chosen from a list
of allowed values that are enumerated explicitly in the column
specification at table creation time.

The value may also be the empty string (`""') or `NULL' under certain
circumstances:

   * If you insert an invalid value into an `ENUM' (that is, a string
     not present in the list of allowed values), the empty string is
     inserted instead as a special error value.

   * If an `ENUM' is declared `NULL', `NULL' is also a legal value for
     the column, and the default value is `NULL'.  If an `ENUM' is
     declared `NOT NULL', the default value is the first element of the
     list of allowed values.

Each enumeration value has an index:

   * Values from the list of allowable elements in the column
     specification are numbered beginning with 1.

   * The index value of the empty string error value is 0.  This means
     that you can use the following `SELECT' statement to find rows
     into which invalid `ENUM' values were assigned:

          mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;

   * The index of the `NULL' value is `NULL'.

For example, a column specified as `ENUM("one", "two", "three")' can
have any of the values shown below.  The index of each value is also
shown:

*Value*        *Index*
`NULL'         `NULL'
`""'           0
`"one"'        1
`"two"'        2
`"three"'      3

An enumeration can have a maximum of 65535 elements.

Lettercase is irrelevant when you assign values to an `ENUM' column.
However, values retrieved from the column later have lettercase
matching the values that were used to specify the allowable values at
table creation time.

If you retrieve an `ENUM' in a numeric context, the column value's
index is returned.  For example, you can retrieve numeric values from
an `ENUM' column like this:

     mysql> SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;

If you store a number into an `ENUM', the number is treated as an
index, and the value stored is the enumeration member with that index.
(However, this will not work with `LOAD DATA', which treats all input
as strings.)

`ENUM' values are sorted according to the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification.  (In other words,
`ENUM' values are sorted according to their index numbers.)  For
example, `"a"' sorts before `"b"' for `ENUM("a", "b")', but `"b"' sorts
before `"a"' for `ENUM("b", "a")'.  The empty string sorts before
non-empty strings, and `NULL' values sort before all other enumeration
values.

If you want to get all possible values for an `ENUM' column, you should
use: `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE enum_column_name' and parse the
`ENUM' definition in the second column.


File: mysql.info,  Node: SET,  Prev: ENUM,  Up: String types

The `SET' Type
..............

A `SET' is a string object that can have zero or more values, each of
which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the
table is created.  `SET' column values that consist of multiple set
members are specified with members separated by commas (`,').  A
consequence of this is that `SET' member values cannot themselves
contain commas.

For example, a column specified as `SET("one", "two") NOT NULL' can have
any of these values:

     ""
     "one"
     "two"
     "one,two"

A `SET' can have a maximum of 64 different members.

MySQL stores `SET' values numerically, with the low-order bit of the
stored value corresponding to the first set member.  If you retrieve a
`SET' value in a numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set
corresponding to the set members that make up the column value.  For
example, you can retrieve numeric values from a `SET' column like this:

     mysql> SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;

If a number is stored into a `SET' column, the bits that are set in the
binary representation of the number determine the set members in the
column value.  Suppose a column is specified as `SET("a","b","c","d")'.
Then the members have the following bit values:

`SET'          *Decimal       *Binary value*
*member*       value*         
`a'            `1'            `0001'
`b'            `2'            `0010'
`c'            `4'            `0100'
`d'            `8'            `1000'

If you assign a value of `9' to this column, that is `1001' in binary,
so the first and fourth `SET' value members `"a"' and `"d"' are
selected and the resulting value is `"a,d"'.

For a value containing more than one `SET' element, it does not matter
what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value.  It
also does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the
value.  When the value is retrieved later, each element in the value
will appear once, with elements listed according to the order in which
they were specified at table creation time.  For example, if a column
is specified as `SET("a","b","c","d")', then `"a,d"', `"d,a"', and
`"d,a,a,d,d"' will all appear as `"a,d"' when retrieved.

`SET' values are sorted numerically.  `NULL' values sort before
non-`NULL' `SET' values.

Normally, you perform a `SELECT' on a `SET' column using the `LIKE'
operator or the `FIND_IN_SET()' function:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)>0;

But the following will also work:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col & 1;

The first of these statements looks for an exact match.  The second
looks for values containing the first set member.

If you want to get all possible values for a `SET' column, you should
use: `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE set_column_name' and parse the
`SET' definition in the second column.

Choosing the Right Type for a Column
------------------------------------

For the most efficient use of storage, try to use the most precise type
in all cases. For example, if an integer column will be used for values
in the range between `1' and `99999', `MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED' is the best
type.

Accurate representation of monetary values is a common problem. In
MySQL, you should use the `DECIMAL' type. This is stored as a string,
so no loss of accuracy should occur. If accuracy is not too important,
the `DOUBLE' type may also be good enough.

For high precision, you can always convert to a fixed-point type stored
in a `BIGINT'. This allows you to do all calculations with integers and
convert results back to floating-point values only when necessary.

Using Column Types from Other Database Engines
----------------------------------------------

To make it easier to use code written for SQL implementations from other
vendors, MySQL maps column types as shown in the table below.  These
mappings make it easier to move table definitions from other database
engines to MySQL:

*Other vendor type*           *MySQL type*
`BINARY(NUM)'                 `CHAR(NUM) BINARY'
`CHAR VARYING(NUM)'           `VARCHAR(NUM)'
`FLOAT4'                      `FLOAT'
`FLOAT8'                      `DOUBLE'
`INT1'                        `TINYINT'
`INT2'                        `SMALLINT'
`INT3'                        `MEDIUMINT'
`INT4'                        `INT'
`INT8'                        `BIGINT'
`LONG VARBINARY'              `MEDIUMBLOB'
`LONG VARCHAR'                `MEDIUMTEXT'
`MIDDLEINT'                   `MEDIUMINT'
`VARBINARY(NUM)'              `VARCHAR(NUM) BINARY'

Column type mapping occurs at table creation time.  If you create a
table with types used by other vendors and then issue a `DESCRIBE
tbl_name' statement, MySQL reports the table structure using the
equivalent MySQL types.

Column Type Storage Requirements
--------------------------------

The storage requirements for each of the column types supported by
MySQL are listed below by category.

`NUMERIC(M,D)'                       `M+2' bytes if D > 0, `M+1' bytes
                                     if D = 0 (`D'+2, if `M < D')

Storage requirements for date and time types

`TIMESTAMP'                          4 bytes
`TIME'                               3 bytes
`YEAR'                               1 byte

Storage requirements for string types
.....................................

*Column type*                        *Storage required*
`CHAR(M)'                            `M' bytes, `1 <= M <= 255'
`VARCHAR(M)'                         `L'+1 bytes, where `L <= M' and `1
                                     <= M <= 255'
`TINYBLOB', `TINYTEXT'               `L'+1 bytes, where `L' < 2^8
`BLOB', `TEXT'                       `L'+2 bytes, where `L' < 2^16
`MEDIUMBLOB', `MEDIUMTEXT'           `L'+3 bytes, where `L' < 2^24
`LONGBLOB', `LONGTEXT'               `L'+4 bytes, where `L' < 2^32
`ENUM('value1','value2',...)'        1 or 2 bytes, depending on the
                                     number of enumeration values (65535
                                     values maximum)
`SET('value1','value2',...)'         1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 bytes, depending on
                                     the number of set members (64
                                     members maximum)

`VARCHAR' and the `BLOB' and `TEXT' types are variable-length types,
for which the storage requirements depend on the actual length of
column values (represented by `L' in the preceding table), rather than
on the type's maximum possible size.  For example, a `VARCHAR(10)'
column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters.  The
actual storage required is the length of the string (`L'), plus 1 byte
to record the length of the string.  For the string `'abcd'', `L' is 4
and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

The `BLOB' and `TEXT' types require 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes to record the
length of the column value, depending on the maximum possible length of
the type.  *Note BLOB::.

If a table includes any variable-length column types, the record format
will also be variable-length.  Note that when a table is created, MySQL
may, under certain conditions, change a column from a variable-length
type to a fixed-length type, or vice-versa.  *Note Silent column
changes::.

The size of an `ENUM' object is determined by the number of different
enumeration values.  One byte is used for enumerations with up to 255
possible values.  Two bytes are used for enumerations with up to 65535
values. *Note ENUM::.

The size of a `SET' object is determined by the number of different set
members.  If the set size is `N', the object occupies `(N+7)/8' bytes,
rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes.  A `SET' can have a maximum of 64
members. *Note SET::.

Functions for Use in `SELECT' and `WHERE' Clauses
=================================================

A `select_expression' or `where_definition' in a SQL statement can
consist of any expression using the functions described below.

An expression that contains `NULL' always produces a `NULL' value
unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for the operators and
functions involved in the expression.

*NOTE:* There must be no whitespace between a function name and the
parenthesis following it. This helps the MySQL parser distinguish
between function calls and references to tables or columns that happen
to have the same name as a function.  Spaces around arguments are
permitted, though.

You can force MySQL to accept spaces after the function name by
starting `mysqld' with `--ansi' or using the `CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE' to
`mysql_connect()', but in this case all function names will become
reserved words. *Note ANSI mode::.

For the sake of brevity, examples display the output from the `mysql'
program in abbreviated form.  So this:

     mysql> select MOD(29,9);
     1 rows in set (0.00 sec)
     
     +-----------+
     | mod(29,9) |
     +-----------+
     |         2 |
     +-----------+

is displayed like this:

     mysql> select MOD(29,9);
             -> 2

Comparison Operators
....................

Comparison operations result in a value of `1' (TRUE), `0' (FALSE), or
`NULL'. These functions work for both numbers and strings.  Strings are
automatically converted to numbers and numbers to strings as needed (as
in Perl).

MySQL performs comparisons using the following rules:

   * If one or both arguments are `NULL', the result of the comparison
     is `NULL', except for the `<=>' operator.

   * If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they are
     compared as strings.

   * If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.

   * Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not compared
     to a number.

   * If one of the arguments is a `TIMESTAMP' or `DATETIME' column and
     the other argument is a constant, the constant is converted to a
     timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to be
     more ODBC-friendly.

   * In all other cases, the arguments are compared as floating-point
     (real) numbers.

By default, string comparisons are done in case-independent fashion
using the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default, which
also works excellently for English).

The examples below illustrate conversion of strings to numbers for
comparison operations:

     mysql> SELECT 1 > '6x';
              -> 0
     mysql> SELECT 7 > '6x';
              -> 1
     mysql> SELECT 0 > 'x6';
              -> 0
     mysql> SELECT 0 = 'x6';
              -> 1

`='
     Equal:
          mysql> select 1 = 0;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select '0' = 0;
                  -> 1
          mysql> select '0.0' = 0;
                  -> 1
          mysql> select '0.01' = 0;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select '.01' = 0.01;
                  -> 1

`<>'
`!='
     Not equal:
          mysql> select '.01' <> '0.01';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select .01 <> '0.01';
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 'zapp' <> 'zappp';
                  -> 1

`<='
     Less than or equal:
          mysql> select 0.1 <= 2;
                  -> 1

`<'
     Less than:
          mysql> select 2 < 2;
                  -> 0

`>='
     Greater than or equal:
          mysql> select 2 >= 2;
                  -> 1

`>'
     Greater than:
          mysql> select 2 > 2;
                  -> 0

`<=>'
     Null safe equal:
          mysql> select 1 <=> 1, NULL <=> NULL, 1 <=> NULL;
                  -> 1 1 0

`IS NULL'
`IS NOT NULL'
     Test whether or not a value is or is not `NULL':
          mysql> select 1 IS NULL, 0 IS NULL, NULL IS NULL;
                  -> 0 0 1
          mysql> select 1 IS NOT NULL, 0 IS NOT NULL, NULL IS NOT NULL;
                  -> 1 1 0

`expr BETWEEN min AND max'
     If `expr' is greater than or equal to `min' and `expr' is less
     than or equal to `max', `BETWEEN' returns `1', otherwise it
     returns `0'.  This is equivalent to the expression `(min <= expr
     AND expr <= max)' if all the arguments are of the same type.  The
     first argument (`expr') determines how the comparison is performed
     as follows:

        * If `expr' is a `TIMESTAMP', `DATE', or `DATETIME' column,
          `MIN()' and `MAX()' are formatted to the same format if they
          are constants.

        * If `expr' is a case-insensitive string expression, a
          case-insensitive string comparison is done.

        * If `expr' is a case-sensitive string expression, a
          case-sensitive string comparison is done.

        * If `expr' is an integer expression, an integer comparison is
          done.

        * Otherwise, a floating-point (real) comparison is done.

          mysql> select 1 BETWEEN 2 AND 3;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 'b' BETWEEN 'a' AND 'c';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select 2 BETWEEN 2 AND '3';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select 2 BETWEEN 2 AND 'x-3';
                  -> 0

`expr IN (value,...)'
     Returns `1' if `expr' is any of the values in the `IN' list, else
     returns `0'.  If all values are constants, then all values are
     evaluated according to the type of `expr' and sorted. The search
     for the item is then done using a binary search. This means `IN'
     is very quick if the `IN' value list consists entirely of
     constants.  If `expr' is a case-sensitive string expression, the
     string comparison is performed in case-sensitive fashion:

          mysql> select 2 IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 'wefwf' IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
                  -> 1

`expr NOT IN (value,...)'
     Same as `NOT (expr IN (value,...))'.

`ISNULL(expr)'
     If `expr' is `NULL', `ISNULL()' returns `1', otherwise it returns
     `0':
          mysql> select ISNULL(1+1);
                  -> 0
          mysql> select ISNULL(1/0);
                  -> 1

     Note that a comparison of `NULL' values using `=' will always be
     false!

`COALESCE(list)'
     Returns first non-`NULL' element in list:

          mysql> select COALESCE(NULL,1);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select COALESCE(NULL,NULL,NULL);
                  -> NULL

`INTERVAL(N,N1,N2,N3,...)'
     Returns `0' if `N' < `N1', `1' if `N' < `N2' and so on. All
     arguments are treated as integers.  It is required that `N1' <
     `N2' < `N3' < `...' < `Nn' for this function to work correctly.
     This is because a binary search is used (very fast):

          mysql> select INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 44, 200);
                  -> 3
          mysql> select INTERVAL(10, 1, 10, 100, 1000);
                  -> 2
          mysql> select INTERVAL(22, 23, 30, 44, 200);
                  -> 0

If you are comparing case sensitive string with any of the standard
operators (`=', `<>'..., but not `LIKE') end space will be ignored.

     mysql> select "a" ="A ";
             -> 1

Logical Operators
.................

All logical functions return `1' (TRUE), `0' (FALSE) or `NULL'
(unknown, which is in most cases the same as FALSE):

`NOT'
`!'
     Logical NOT. Returns `1' if the argument is `0', otherwise returns
     `0'.  Exception: `NOT NULL' returns `NULL':
          mysql> select NOT 1;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select NOT NULL;
                  -> NULL
          mysql> select ! (1+1);
                  -> 0
          mysql> select ! 1+1;
                  -> 1
     The last example returns `1' because the expression evaluates the
     same way as `(!1)+1'.

`OR'
`||'
     Logical OR. Returns `1' if either argument is not `0' and not
     `NULL':
          mysql> select 1 || 0;
                  -> 1
          mysql> select 0 || 0;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 1 || NULL;
                  -> 1

`AND'
`&&'
     Logical AND. Returns `0' if either argument is `0' or `NULL',
     otherwise returns `1':
          mysql> select 1 && NULL;
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 1 && 0;
                  -> 0

Control Flow Functions
......................

`IFNULL(expr1,expr2)'
     If `expr1' is not `NULL', `IFNULL()' returns `expr1', else it
     returns `expr2'.  `IFNULL()' returns a numeric or string value,
     depending on the context in which it is used:
          mysql> select IFNULL(1,0);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select IFNULL(NULL,10);
                  -> 10
          mysql> select IFNULL(1/0,10);
                  -> 10
          mysql> select IFNULL(1/0,'yes');
                  -> 'yes'

`NULLIF(expr1,expr2)'
     If `expr1 = expr2' is true, return `NULL' else return `expr1'.
     This is the same as `CASE WHEN x = y THEN NULL ELSE x END':
          mysql> select NULLIF(1,1);
                  -> NULL
          mysql> select NULLIF(1,2);
                  -> 1

     Note that `expr1' is evaluated twice in MySQL if the arguments are
     equal.

`IF(expr1,expr2,expr3)'
     If `expr1' is TRUE (`expr1 <> 0' and `expr1 <> NULL') then `IF()'
     returns `expr2', else it returns `expr3'.  `IF()' returns a
     numeric or string value, depending on the context in which it is
     used:

          mysql> select IF(1>2,2,3);
                  -> 3
          mysql> select IF(1<2,'yes','no');
                  -> 'yes'
          mysql> select IF(strcmp('test','test1'),'no','yes');
                  -> 'no'

     `expr1' is evaluated as an integer value, which means that if you
     are testing floating-point or string values, you should do so
     using a comparison operation:

          mysql> select IF(0.1,1,0);
                  -> 0
          mysql> select IF(0.1<>0,1,0);
                  -> 1

     In the first case above, `IF(0.1)' returns `0' because `0.1' is
     converted to an integer value, resulting in a test of `IF(0)'.
     This may not be what you expect.  In the second case, the
     comparison tests the original floating-point value to see whether
     it is non-zero.  The result of the comparison is used as an
     integer.

     The default return type of `IF()' (which may matter when it is
     stored into a temporary table) is calculated in MySQL Version 3.23
     as follows:

     *Expression*                          *Return value*
     expr2 or expr3 returns string         string
     expr2 or expr3 returns a              floating-point
     floating-point value                  
     expr2 or expr3 returns an integer     integer

     If expr2 and expr3 are strings, then the result is case sensitive
     if both strings are case sensitive. (Starting from 3.23.51)

`CASE value WHEN [compare-value] THEN result [WHEN [compare-value] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END'

`CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result [WHEN [condition] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END'
     The first version returns the `result' where
     `value=compare-value'. The second version returns the result for
     the first condition, which is true. If there was no matching result
     value, then the result after `ELSE' is returned. If there is no
     `ELSE' part then `NULL' is returned:

          mysql> SELECT CASE 1 WHEN 1 THEN "one" WHEN 2 THEN "two" ELSE "more" END;
                 -> "one"
          mysql> SELECT CASE WHEN 1>0 THEN "true" ELSE "false" END;
                 -> "true"
          mysql> SELECT CASE BINARY "B" when "a" then 1 when "b" then 2 END;
                 -> NULL

The type of the return value (`INTEGER', `DOUBLE' or `STRING') is the
same as the type of the first returned value (the expression after the
first `THEN').

String Functions
----------------

String-valued functions return `NULL' if the length of the result would
be greater than the `max_allowed_packet' server parameter.  *Note
Server parameters::.

For functions that operate on string positions, the first position is
numbered 1.

`ASCII(str)'
     Returns the ASCII code value of the leftmost character of the
     string `str'. Returns `0' if `str' is the empty string.  Returns
     `NULL' if `str' is `NULL':

          mysql> select ASCII('2');
                  -> 50
          mysql> select ASCII(2);
                  -> 50
          mysql> select ASCII('dx');
                  -> 100

     See also the `ORD()' function.

`ORD(str)'
     If the leftmost character of the string str is a multi-byte
     character, returns the code of multi-byte character by returning
     the ASCII code value of the character in the format of: `((first
     byte ASCII code)*256+(second byte ASCII code))[*256+third byte
     ASCII code...]'.  If the leftmost character is not a multi-byte
     character, returns the same value as the like `ASCII()' function
     does:

          mysql> select ORD('2');
                  -> 50

`CONV(N,from_base,to_base)'
     Converts numbers between different number bases.  Returns a string
     representation of the number `N', converted from base `from_base'
     to base `to_base'.  Returns `NULL' if any argument is `NULL'.  The
     argument `N' is interpreted as an integer, but may be specified as
     an integer or a string.  The minimum base is `2' and the maximum
     base is `36'.  If `to_base' is a negative number, `N' is regarded
     as a signed number.  Otherwise, `N' is treated as unsigned.
     `CONV' works with 64-bit precision:

          mysql> select CONV("a",16,2);
                  -> '1010'
          mysql> select CONV("6E",18,8);
                  -> '172'
          mysql> select CONV(-17,10,-18);
                  -> '-H'
          mysql> select CONV(10+"10"+'10'+0xa,10,10);
                  -> '40'

`BIN(N)'
     Returns a string representation of the binary value of `N', where
     `N' is a longlong (`BIGINT') number.  This is equivalent to
     `CONV(N,10,2)'.  Returns `NULL' if `N' is `NULL':

          mysql> select BIN(12);
                  -> '1100'

`OCT(N)'
     Returns a string representation of the octal value of `N', where
     `N' is a longlong number.  This is equivalent to `CONV(N,10,8)'.
     Returns `NULL' if `N' is `NULL':

          mysql> select OCT(12);
                  -> '14'

`HEX(N)'
     Returns a string representation of the hexadecimal value of `N',
     where `N' is a longlong (`BIGINT') number.  This is equivalent to
     `CONV(N,10,16)'.  Returns `NULL' if `N' is `NULL':

          mysql> select HEX(255);
                  -> 'FF'

`CHAR(N,...)'
     `CHAR()' interprets the arguments as integers and returns a string
     consisting of the characters given by the ASCII code values of
     those integers. `NULL' values are skipped:

          mysql> select CHAR(77,121,83,81,'76');
                  -> 'MySQL'
          mysql> select CHAR(77,77.3,'77.3');
                  -> 'MMM'

`CONCAT(str1,str2,...)'
     Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments.
     Returns `NULL' if any argument is `NULL'.  May have more than 2
     arguments.  A numeric argument is converted to the equivalent
     string form:

          mysql> select CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');
                  -> 'MySQL'
          mysql> select CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL');
                  -> NULL
          mysql> select CONCAT(14.3);
                  -> '14.3'

`CONCAT_WS(separator, str1, str2,...)'
     `CONCAT_WS()' stands for CONCAT With Separator and is a special
     form of `CONCAT()'.  The first argument is the separator for the
     rest of the arguments. The separator can be a string as well as
     the rest of the arguments. If the separator is `NULL', the result
     will be `NULL'.  The function will skip any `NULL's and empty
     strings, after the separator argument. The separator will be added
     between the strings to be concatenated:

          mysql> select CONCAT_WS(",","First name","Second name","Last Name");
                 -> 'First name,Second name,Last Name'
          mysql> select CONCAT_WS(",","First name",NULL,"Last Name");
                 -> 'First name,Last Name'

`LENGTH(str)'
`OCTET_LENGTH(str)'
`CHAR_LENGTH(str)'
`CHARACTER_LENGTH(str)'
     Returns the length of the string `str':

          mysql> select LENGTH('text');
                  -> 4
          mysql> select OCTET_LENGTH('text');
                  -> 4

     Note that for `CHAR_LENGTH()', multi-byte characters are only
     counted once.

`LOCATE(substr,str)'
`POSITION(substr IN str)'
     Returns the position of the first occurrence of substring `substr'
     in string `str'. Returns `0' if `substr' is not in `str':

          mysql> select LOCATE('bar', 'foobarbar');
                  -> 4
          mysql> select LOCATE('xbar', 'foobar');
                  -> 0

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`LOCATE(substr,str,pos)'
     Returns the position of the first occurrence of substring `substr'
     in string `str', starting at position `pos'.  Returns `0' if
     `substr' is not in `str':

          mysql> select LOCATE('bar', 'foobarbar',5);
                  -> 7

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`INSTR(str,substr)'
     Returns the position of the first occurrence of substring `substr'
     in string `str'. This is the same as the two-argument form of
     `LOCATE()', except that the arguments are swapped:

          mysql> select INSTR('foobarbar', 'bar');
                  -> 4
          mysql> select INSTR('xbar', 'foobar');
                  -> 0

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`LPAD(str,len,padstr)'
     Returns the string `str', left-padded with the string `padstr'
     until `str' is `len' characters long. If `str' is longer than
     `len'' then it will be shortened to `len' characters.

          mysql> select LPAD('hi',4,'??');
                  -> '??hi'

`RPAD(str,len,padstr)'
     Returns the string `str', right-padded with the string `padstr'
     until `str' is `len' characters long.  If `str' is longer than
     `len'' then it will be shortened to `len' characters.

          mysql> select RPAD('hi',5,'?');
                  -> 'hi???'

`LEFT(str,len)'
     Returns the leftmost `len' characters from the string `str':

          mysql> select LEFT('foobarbar', 5);
                  -> 'fooba'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`RIGHT(str,len)'
     Returns the rightmost `len' characters from the string `str':

          mysql> select RIGHT('foobarbar', 4);
                  -> 'rbar'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`SUBSTRING(str,pos,len)'
`SUBSTRING(str FROM pos FOR len)'
`MID(str,pos,len)'
     Returns a substring `len' characters long from string `str',
     starting at position `pos'.  The variant form that uses `FROM' is
     ANSI SQL92 syntax:

          mysql> select SUBSTRING('Quadratically',5,6);
                  -> 'ratica'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`SUBSTRING(str,pos)'

`SUBSTRING(str FROM pos)'
     Returns a substring from string `str' starting at position `pos':

          mysql> select SUBSTRING('Quadratically',5);
                  -> 'ratically'
          mysql> select SUBSTRING('foobarbar' FROM 4);
                  -> 'barbar'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`SUBSTRING_INDEX(str,delim,count)'
     Returns the substring from string `str' before `count' occurrences
     of the delimiter `delim'.  If `count' is positive, everything to
     the left of the final delimiter (counting from the left) is
     returned.  If `count' is negative, everything to the right of the
     final delimiter (counting from the right) is returned:

          mysql> select SUBSTRING_INDEX('www.mysql.com', '.', 2);
                  -> 'www.mysql'
          mysql> select SUBSTRING_INDEX('www.mysql.com', '.', -2);
                  -> 'mysql.com'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`LTRIM(str)'
     Returns the string `str' with leading space characters removed:

          mysql> select LTRIM('  barbar');
                  -> 'barbar'

`RTRIM(str)'
     Returns the string `str' with trailing space characters removed:

          mysql> select RTRIM('barbar   ');
                  -> 'barbar'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)'
     Returns the string `str' with all `remstr' prefixes and/or suffixes
     removed. If none of the specifiers `BOTH', `LEADING' or `TRAILING'
     are given, `BOTH' is assumed. If `remstr' is not specified, spaces
     are removed:

          mysql> select TRIM('  bar   ');
                  -> 'bar'
          mysql> select TRIM(LEADING 'x' FROM 'xxxbarxxx');
                  -> 'barxxx'
          mysql> select TRIM(BOTH 'x' FROM 'xxxbarxxx');
                  -> 'bar'
          mysql> select TRIM(TRAILING 'xyz' FROM 'barxxyz');
                  -> 'barx'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`SOUNDEX(str)'
     Returns a soundex string from `str'. Two strings that sound almost
     the same should have identical soundex strings. A standard soundex
     string is 4 characters long, but the `SOUNDEX()' function returns
     an arbitrarily long string. You can use `SUBSTRING()' on the
     result to get a standard soundex string.  All non-alphanumeric
     characters are ignored in the given string. All international
     alpha characters outside the A-Z range are treated as vowels:

          mysql> select SOUNDEX('Hello');
                  -> 'H400'
          mysql> select SOUNDEX('Quadratically');
                  -> 'Q36324'

`SPACE(N)'
     Returns a string consisting of `N' space characters:

          mysql> select SPACE(6);
                  -> '      '

`REPLACE(str,from_str,to_str)'
     Returns the string `str' with all all occurrences of the string
     `from_str' replaced by the string `to_str':

          mysql> select REPLACE('www.mysql.com', 'w', 'Ww');
                  -> 'WwWwWw.mysql.com'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`REPEAT(str,count)'
     Returns a string consisting of the string `str' repeated `count'
     times. If `count <= 0', returns an empty string. Returns `NULL' if
     `str' or `count' are `NULL':

          mysql> select REPEAT('MySQL', 3);
                  -> 'MySQLMySQLMySQL'

`REVERSE(str)'
     Returns the string `str' with the order of the characters reversed:

          mysql> select REVERSE('abc');
                  -> 'cba'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`INSERT(str,pos,len,newstr)'
     Returns the string `str', with the substring beginning at position
     `pos' and `len' characters long replaced by the string `newstr':

          mysql> select INSERT('Quadratic', 3, 4, 'What');
                  -> 'QuWhattic'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`ELT(N,str1,str2,str3,...)'
     Returns `str1' if `N' = `1', `str2' if `N' = `2', and so on.
     Returns `NULL' if `N' is less than `1' or greater than the number
     of arguments.  `ELT()' is the complement of `FIELD()':

          mysql> select ELT(1, 'ej', 'Heja', 'hej', 'foo');
                  -> 'ej'
          mysql> select ELT(4, 'ej', 'Heja', 'hej', 'foo');
                  -> 'foo'

`FIELD(str,str1,str2,str3,...)'
     Returns the index of `str' in the `str1', `str2', `str3', `...'
     list.  Returns `0' if `str' is not found.  `FIELD()' is the
     complement of `ELT()':

          mysql> select FIELD('ej', 'Hej', 'ej', 'Heja', 'hej', 'foo');
                  -> 2
          mysql> select FIELD('fo', 'Hej', 'ej', 'Heja', 'hej', 'foo');
                  -> 0

`FIND_IN_SET(str,strlist)'
     Returns a value `1' to `N' if the string `str' is in the list
     `strlist' consisting of `N' substrings. A string list is a string
     composed of substrings separated by `,' characters. If the first
     argument is a constant string and the second is a column of type
     `SET', the `FIND_IN_SET()' function is optimized to use bit
     arithmetic!  Returns `0' if `str' is not in `strlist' or if
     `strlist' is the empty string.  Returns `NULL' if either argument
     is `NULL'.  This function will not work properly if the first
     argument contains a `,':

          mysql> SELECT FIND_IN_SET('b','a,b,c,d');
                  -> 2

`MAKE_SET(bits,str1,str2,...)'
     Returns a set (a string containing substrings separated by `,'
     characters) consisting of the strings that have the corresponding
     bit in `bits' set.  `str1' corresponds to bit 0, `str2' to bit 1,
     etc.  `NULL' strings in `str1', `str2', `...' are not appended to
     the result:

          mysql> SELECT MAKE_SET(1,'a','b','c');
                  -> 'a'
          mysql> SELECT MAKE_SET(1 | 4,'hello','nice','world');
                  -> 'hello,world'
          mysql> SELECT MAKE_SET(0,'a','b','c');
                  -> ''

`EXPORT_SET(bits,on,off,[separator,[number_of_bits]])'
     Returns a string where for every bit set in 'bit', you get an 'on'
     string and for every reset bit you get an 'off' string. Each
     string is separated with 'separator' (default ',') and only
     'number_of_bits' (default 64) of 'bits' is used:

          mysql> select EXPORT_SET(5,'Y','N',',',4)
                  -> Y,N,Y,N

`LCASE(str)'
`LOWER(str)'
     Returns the string `str' with all characters changed to lowercase
     according to the current character set mapping (the default is
     ISO-8859-1 Latin1):

          mysql> select LCASE('QUADRATICALLY');
                  -> 'quadratically'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`UCASE(str)'
`UPPER(str)'
     Returns the string `str' with all characters changed to uppercase
     according to the current character set mapping (the default is
     ISO-8859-1 Latin1):

          mysql> select UCASE('Hej');
                  -> 'HEJ'

     This function is multi-byte safe.

`LOAD_FILE(file_name)'
     Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string.  The file
     must be on the server, you must specify the full pathname to the
     file, and you must have the *file* privilege.  The file must be
     readable by all and be smaller than `max_allowed_packet'.

     If the file doesn't exist or can't be read due to one of the above
     reasons, the function returns `NULL':

          mysql> UPDATE table_name
                     SET blob_column=LOAD_FILE("/tmp/picture")
                     WHERE id=1;

If you are not using MySQL Version 3.23, you have to do the reading of
the file inside your application and create an `INSERT' statement to
update the database with the file information. One way to do this, if
you are using the MySQL++ library, can be found at
`http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html'.

MySQL automatically converts numbers to strings as necessary, and
vice-versa:

     mysql> SELECT 1+"1";
             -> 2
     mysql> SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');
             -> '2 test'

If you want to convert a number to a string explicitly, pass it as the
argument to `CONCAT()'.

If a string function is given a binary string as an argument, the
resulting string is also a binary string.  A number converted to a
string is treated as a binary string.  This only affects comparisons.

String Comparison Functions
...........................

Normally, if any expression in a string comparison is case sensitive,
the comparison is performed in case-sensitive fashion.

`expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']'
     Pattern matching using SQL simple regular expression comparison.
     Returns `1' (TRUE) or `0' (FALSE).  With `LIKE' you can use the
     following two wild-card characters in the pattern:

     `%'     Matches any number of characters, even zero characters
     `_'     Matches exactly one character

          mysql> select 'David!' LIKE 'David_';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select 'David!' LIKE '%D%v%';
                  -> 1

     To test for literal instances of a wild-card character, precede
     the character with the escape character.  If you don't specify the
     `ESCAPE' character, `\' is assumed:

     `\%'    Matches one `%' character
     `\_'    Matches one `_' character

          mysql> select 'David!' LIKE 'David\_';
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 'David_' LIKE 'David\_';
                  -> 1

     To specify a different escape character, use the `ESCAPE' clause:

          mysql> select 'David_' LIKE 'David|_' ESCAPE '|';
                  -> 1

     The following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are
     case insensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string:

          mysql> select 'abc' LIKE 'ABC';
                  -> 1
          mysql> SELECT 'abc' LIKE BINARY 'ABC';
                  -> 0

     `LIKE' is allowed on numeric expressions! (This is a MySQL
     extension to the ANSI SQL `LIKE'.)

          mysql> select 10 LIKE '1%';
                  -> 1

     Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for
     example, `\n'), you must double any `\' that you use in your `LIKE'
     strings.  For example, to search for `\n', specify it as `\\n'.  To
     search for `\', specify it as `\\\\' (the backslashes are stripped
     once by the parser and another time when the pattern match is
     done, leaving a single backslash to be matched).

`expr NOT LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']'
     Same as `NOT (expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char'])'.

`expr REGEXP pat'
`expr RLIKE pat'
     Performs a pattern match of a string expression `expr' against a
     pattern `pat'.  The pattern can be an extended regular expression.
     *Note Regexp::.  Returns `1' if `expr' matches `pat', otherwise
     returns `0'.  `RLIKE' is a synonym for `REGEXP', provided for
     `mSQL' compatibility. Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax
     in strings (for example, `\n'), you must double any `\' that you
     use in your `REGEXP' strings.  As of MySQL Version 3.23.4,
     `REGEXP' is case insensitive for normal (not binary) strings:

          mysql> select 'Monty!' REGEXP 'm%y%%';
                  -> 0
          mysql> select 'Monty!' REGEXP '.*';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select 'new*\n*line' REGEXP 'new\\*.\\*line';
                  -> 1
          mysql> select "a" REGEXP "A", "a" REGEXP BINARY "A";
                  -> 1  0
          mysql> select "a" REGEXP "^[a-d]";
                  -> 1

`'
     `REGEXP' and `RLIKE' use the current character set (ISO-8859-1
     Latin1 by default) when deciding the type of a character.

`expr NOT REGEXP pat'
`expr NOT RLIKE pat'
     Same as `NOT (expr REGEXP pat)'.

`STRCMP(expr1,expr2)'
     `STRCMP()' returns `0' if the strings are the same, `-1' if the
     first argument is smaller than the second according to the current
     sort order, and `1' otherwise:

          mysql> select STRCMP('text', 'text2');
                  -> -1
          mysql> select STRCMP('text2', 'text');
                  -> 1
          mysql> select STRCMP('text', 'text');
                  -> 0

`MATCH (col1,col2,...) AGAINST (expr)'
     `MATCH ... AGAINST()' is used for full-text search and returns
     relevance - similarity measure between the text in columns
     `(col1,col2,...)' and the query `expr'. Relevance is a positive
     floating-point number. Zero relevance means no similarity.  For
     `MATCH ... AGAINST()' to work, a *FULLTEXT* index must be created
     first. *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.  `MATCH ... AGAINST()'
     is available in MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later. For details and
     usage examples *note Fulltext Search::.

Case Sensitivity
................

``BINARY''
     The `BINARY' operator casts the string following it to a binary
     string.  This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be
     case sensitive even if the column isn't defined as `BINARY' or
     `BLOB':
          mysql> select "a" = "A";
                  -> 1
          mysql> select BINARY "a" = "A";
                  -> 0

     `BINARY' was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.0.

     Note that in some context MySQL will not be able to use the index
     efficiently when you cast an indexed column to `BINARY'.

If you want to compare a blob case-insensitively you can always convert
the blob to upper case before doing the comparison:

     SELECT 'A' LIKE UPPER(blob_col) FROM table_name;

We plan to soon introduce casting between different character sets to
make string comparison even more flexible.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Arithmetic functions,  Next: Mathematical functions,  Prev: Numeric Functions,  Up: Numeric Functions

Arithmetic Operations
.....................

The usual arithmetic operators are available. Note that in the case of
`-', `+', and `*', the result is calculated with `BIGINT' (64-bit)
precision if both arguments are integers!

`+'
     Addition:
          mysql> select 3+5;
                  -> 8

`-'
     Subtraction:
          mysql> select 3-5;
                  -> -2

`*'
     Multiplication:
          mysql> select 3*5;
                  -> 15
          mysql> select 18014398509481984*18014398509481984.0;
                  -> 324518553658426726783156020576256.0
          mysql> select 18014398509481984*18014398509481984;
                  -> 0

     The result of the last expression is incorrect because the result
     of the integer multiplication exceeds the 64-bit range of `BIGINT'
     calculations.

`/'
     Division:
          mysql> select 3/5;
                  -> 0.60

     Division by zero produces a `NULL' result:

          mysql> select 102/(1-1);
                  -> NULL

     A division will be calculated with `BIGINT' arithmetic only if
     performed in a context where its result is converted to an integer!


File: mysql.info,  Node: Mathematical functions,  Prev: Arithmetic functions,  Up: Numeric Functions

Mathematical Functions
......................

All mathematical functions return `NULL' in case of an error.

`-'
     Unary minus. Changes the sign of the argument:
          mysql> select - 2;
                  -> -2

     Note that if this operator is used with a `BIGINT', the return
     value is a `BIGINT'!  This means that you should avoid using `-'
     on integers that may have the value of `-2^63'!

`ABS(X)'
     Returns the absolute value of `X':
          mysql> select ABS(2);
                  -> 2
          mysql> select ABS(-32);
                  -> 32

     This function is safe to use with `BIGINT' values.

`SIGN(X)'
     Returns the sign of the argument as `-1', `0', or `1', depending
     on whether `X' is negative, zero, or positive:
          mysql> select SIGN(-32);
                  -> -1
          mysql> select SIGN(0);
                  -> 0
          mysql> select SIGN(234);
                  -> 1

`MOD(N,M)'
`%'
     Modulo (like the `%' operator in C).  Returns the remainder of `N'
     divided by `M':
          mysql> select MOD(234, 10);
                  -> 4
          mysql> select 253 % 7;
                  -> 1
          mysql> select MOD(29,9);
                  -> 2

     This function is safe to use with `BIGINT' values.

`FLOOR(X)'
     Returns the largest integer value not greater than `X':
          mysql> select FLOOR(1.23);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select FLOOR(-1.23);
                  -> -2

     Note that the return value is converted to a `BIGINT'!

`CEILING(X)'
     Returns the smallest integer value not less than `X':
          mysql> select CEILING(1.23);
                  -> 2
          mysql> select CEILING(-1.23);
                  -> -1

     Note that the return value is converted to a `BIGINT'!

`ROUND(X)'
     Returns the argument `X', rounded to the nearest integer:
          mysql> select ROUND(-1.23);
                  -> -1
          mysql> select ROUND(-1.58);
                  -> -2
          mysql> select ROUND(1.58);
                  -> 2

     Note that the behavior of `ROUND()' when the argument is half way
     between two integers depends on the C library implementation.
     Some round to the nearest even number, always up, always down, or
     always towards zero.  If you need one kind of rounding, you should
     use a well-defined function like `TRUNCATE()' or `FLOOR()' instead.

`ROUND(X,D)'
     Returns the argument `X', rounded to a number with `D' decimals.
     If `D' is `0', the result will have no decimal point or fractional
     part:

          mysql> select ROUND(1.298, 1);
                  -> 1.3
          mysql> select ROUND(1.298, 0);
                  -> 1

`EXP(X)'
     Returns the value of `e' (the base of natural logarithms) raised to
     the power of `X':
          mysql> select EXP(2);
                  -> 7.389056
          mysql> select EXP(-2);
                  -> 0.135335

`LOG(X)'
     Returns the natural logarithm of `X':
          mysql> select LOG(2);
                  -> 0.693147
          mysql> select LOG(-2);
                  -> NULL
     If you want the log of a number `X' to some arbitary base `B', use
     the formula `LOG(X)/LOG(B)'.

`LOG10(X)'
     Returns the base-10 logarithm of `X':
          mysql> select LOG10(2);
                  -> 0.301030
          mysql> select LOG10(100);
                  -> 2.000000
          mysql> select LOG10(-100);
                  -> NULL

`POW(X,Y)'
`POWER(X,Y)'
     Returns the value of `X' raised to the power of `Y':
          mysql> select POW(2,2);
                  -> 4.000000
          mysql> select POW(2,-2);
                  -> 0.250000

`SQRT(X)'
     Returns the non-negative square root of `X':
          mysql> select SQRT(4);
                  -> 2.000000
          mysql> select SQRT(20);
                  -> 4.472136

`PI()'
     Returns the value of PI. The default shown number of decimals is
     5, but MySQL internally uses the full double precession for PI.
          mysql> select PI();
                  -> 3.141593
          mysql> SELECT PI()+0.000000000000000000;
                  -> 3.141592653589793116

`COS(X)'
     Returns the cosine of `X', where `X' is given in radians:
          mysql> select COS(PI());
                  -> -1.000000

`SIN(X)'
     Returns the sine of `X', where `X' is given in radians:
          mysql> select SIN(PI());
                  -> 0.000000

`TAN(X)'
     Returns the tangent of `X', where `X' is given in radians:
          mysql> select TAN(PI()+1);
                  -> 1.557408

`ACOS(X)'
     Returns the arc cosine of `X', that is, the value whose cosine is
     `X'. Returns `NULL' if `X' is not in the range `-1' to `1':
          mysql> select ACOS(1);
                  -> 0.000000
          mysql> select ACOS(1.0001);
                  -> NULL
          mysql> select ACOS(0);
                  -> 1.570796

`ASIN(X)'
     Returns the arc sine of `X', that is, the value whose sine is `X'.
     Returns `NULL' if `X' is not in the range `-1' to `1':
          mysql> select ASIN(0.2);
                  -> 0.201358
          mysql> select ASIN('foo');
                  -> 0.000000

`ATAN(X)'
     Returns the arc tangent of `X', that is, the value whose tangent is
     `X':
          mysql> select ATAN(2);
                  -> 1.107149
          mysql> select ATAN(-2);
                  -> -1.107149

`ATAN(Y,X)'
`ATAN2(Y,X)'
     Returns the arc tangent of the two variables `X' and `Y'. It is
     similar to calculating the arc tangent of `Y / X', except that the
     signs of both arguments are used to determine the quadrant of the
     result:
          mysql> select ATAN(-2,2);
                  -> -0.785398
          mysql> select ATAN2(PI(),0);
                  -> 1.570796

`COT(X)'
     Returns the cotangent of `X':
          mysql> select COT(12);
                  -> -1.57267341
          mysql> select COT(0);
                  -> NULL

`RAND()'
`RAND(N)'
     Returns a random floating-point value in the range `0' to `1.0'.
     If an integer argument `N' is specified, it is used as the seed
     value:
          mysql> select RAND();
                  -> 0.5925
          mysql> select RAND(20);
                  -> 0.1811
          mysql> select RAND(20);
                  -> 0.1811
          mysql> select RAND();
                  -> 0.2079
          mysql> select RAND();
                  -> 0.7888
     You can't use a column with `RAND()' values in an `ORDER BY'
     clause, because `ORDER BY' would evaluate the column multiple
     times.  In MySQL Version 3.23, you can, however, do: `SELECT *
     FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND()'

     This is useful to get a random sample of a set `SELECT * FROM
     table1,table2 WHERE a=b AND c<d ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000'.

     Note that a `RAND()' in a `WHERE' clause will be re-evaluated
     every time the `WHERE' is executed.

`LEAST(X,Y,...)'
     With two or more arguments, returns the smallest (minimum-valued)
     argument.  The arguments are compared using the following rules:

        * If the return value is used in an `INTEGER' context, or all
          arguments are integer-valued, they are compared as integers.

        * If the return value is used in a `REAL' context, or all
          arguments are real-valued, they are compared as reals.

        * If any argument is a case-sensitive string, the arguments are
          compared as case-sensitive strings.

        * In other cases, the arguments are compared as
          case-insensitive strings:

          mysql> select LEAST(2,0);
                  -> 0
          mysql> select LEAST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
                  -> 3.0
          mysql> select LEAST("B","A","C");
                  -> "A"
     In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use `MIN()'
     instead of `LEAST'.

`GREATEST(X,Y,...)'
     Returns the largest (maximum-valued) argument.  The arguments are
     compared using the same rules as for `LEAST':
          mysql> select GREATEST(2,0);
                  -> 2
          mysql> select GREATEST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
                  -> 767.0
          mysql> select GREATEST("B","A","C");
                  -> "C"
     In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use `MAX()'
     instead of `GREATEST'.

`DEGREES(X)'
     Returns the argument `X', converted from radians to degrees:
          mysql> select DEGREES(PI());
                  -> 180.000000

`RADIANS(X)'
     Returns the argument `X', converted from degrees to radians:
          mysql> select RADIANS(90);
                  -> 1.570796

`TRUNCATE(X,D)'
     Returns the number `X', truncated to `D' decimals.  If `D' is `0',
     the result will have no decimal point or fractional part:
          mysql> select TRUNCATE(1.223,1);
                  -> 1.2
          mysql> select TRUNCATE(1.999,1);
                  -> 1.9
          mysql> select TRUNCATE(1.999,0);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select TRUNCATE(-1,999,1);
                  -> -1.9

     Starting from MySQL 3.23.51 all numbers are rounded towards zero.

     If `D' is negative, then the whole part of the number is zeroed
     out:

          mysql> select truncate(122,-2);
                 -> 100

     Note that as decimal numbers are normally not stored as exact
     numbers in computers, but as double values, you may be fooled by
     the following result:

          mysql> select TRUNCATE(10.28*100,0);
                 -> 1027

     The above happens because 10.28 is actually stored as something
     like 10.2799999999999999.

Date and Time Functions
-----------------------

See *Note Date and time types:: for a description of the range of values
each type has and the valid formats in which date and time values may be
specified.

Here is an example that uses date functions.  The query below selects
all records with a `date_col' value from within the last 30 days:

     mysql> SELECT something FROM table
                WHERE TO_DAYS(NOW()) - TO_DAYS(date_col) <= 30;

`DAYOFWEEK(date)'
     Returns the weekday index

     for `date' (`1' = Sunday, `2' = Monday, ... `7' = Saturday).
     These index values correspond to the ODBC standard:

          mysql> select DAYOFWEEK('1998-02-03');
                  -> 3

`WEEKDAY(date)'
     Returns the weekday index for `date' (`0' = Monday, `1' = Tuesday,
     ... `6' = Sunday):

          mysql> select WEEKDAY('1997-10-04 22:23:00');
                  -> 5
          mysql> select WEEKDAY('1997-11-05');
                  -> 2

`DAYOFMONTH(date)'
     Returns the day of the month for `date', in the range `1' to `31':

          mysql> select DAYOFMONTH('1998-02-03');
                  -> 3

`DAYOFYEAR(date)'
     Returns the day of the year for `date', in the range `1' to `366':

          mysql> select DAYOFYEAR('1998-02-03');
                  -> 34

`MONTH(date)'
     Returns the month for `date', in the range `1' to `12':

          mysql> select MONTH('1998-02-03');
                  -> 2

`DAYNAME(date)'
     Returns the name of the weekday for `date':

          mysql> select DAYNAME("1998-02-05");
                  -> 'Thursday'

`MONTHNAME(date)'
     Returns the name of the month for `date':

          mysql> select MONTHNAME("1998-02-05");
                  -> 'February'

`QUARTER(date)'
     Returns the quarter of the year for `date', in the range `1' to
     `4':

          mysql> select QUARTER('98-04-01');
                  -> 2

`WEEK(date)'
`WEEK(date,first)'
     With a single argument, returns the week for `date', in the range
     `0' to `53' (yes, there may be the beginnings of a week 53), for
     locations where Sunday is the first day of the week.  The
     two-argument form of `WEEK()' allows you to specify whether the
     week starts on Sunday or Monday.  The week starts on Sunday if the
     second argument is `0', on Monday if the second argument is `1':

          mysql> select WEEK('1998-02-20');
                  -> 7
          mysql> select WEEK('1998-02-20',0);
                  -> 7
          mysql> select WEEK('1998-02-20',1);
                  -> 8
          mysql> select WEEK('1998-12-31',1);
                  -> 53

`YEAR(date)'
     Returns the year for `date', in the range `1000' to `9999':

          mysql> select YEAR('98-02-03');
                  -> 1998

`YEARWEEK(date)'
`YEARWEEK(date,first)'
     Returns year and week for a date.  The second arguments works
     exactly like the second argument to `WEEK()'.  Note that the year
     may be different from the year in the date argument for the first
     and the last week of the year:

          mysql> select YEARWEEK('1987-01-01');
                  -> 198653

`HOUR(time)'
     Returns the hour for `time', in the range `0' to `23':

          mysql> select HOUR('10:05:03');
                  -> 10

`MINUTE(time)'
     Returns the minute for `time', in the range `0' to `59':

          mysql> select MINUTE('98-02-03 10:05:03');
                  -> 5

`SECOND(time)'
     Returns the second for `time', in the range `0' to `59':

          mysql> select SECOND('10:05:03');
                  -> 3

`PERIOD_ADD(P,N)'
     Adds `N' months to period `P' (in the format `YYMM' or `YYYYMM').
     Returns a value in the format `YYYYMM'.

     Note that the period argument `P' is _not_ a date value:

          mysql> select PERIOD_ADD(9801,2);
                  -> 199803

`PERIOD_DIFF(P1,P2)'
     Returns the number of months between periods `P1' and `P2'.  `P1'
     and `P2' should be in the format `YYMM' or `YYYYMM'.

     Note that the period arguments `P1' and `P2' are _not_ date values:

          mysql> select PERIOD_DIFF(9802,199703);
                  -> 11

`DATE_ADD(date,INTERVAL expr type)'
`DATE_SUB(date,INTERVAL expr type)'
`ADDDATE(date,INTERVAL expr type)'
`SUBDATE(date,INTERVAL expr type)'
     These functions perform date arithmetic.  They are new for MySQL
     Version 3.22.  `ADDDATE()' and `SUBDATE()' are synonyms for
     `DATE_ADD()' and `DATE_SUB()'.

     In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use `+' and `-' instead of
     `DATE_ADD()' and `DATE_SUB()' if the expression on the right side
     is a date or datetime column. (See example)

     `date' is a `DATETIME' or `DATE' value specifying the starting
     date.  `expr' is an expression specifying the interval value to be
     added or subtracted from the starting date.  `expr' is a string;
     it may start with a `-' for negative intervals.  `type' is a
     keyword indicating how the expression should be interpreted.

     The related function `EXTRACT(type FROM date)' returns the 'type'
     interval from the date.

     The following table shows how the `type' and `expr' arguments are
     related:

     `type' *value*                     *Expected* `expr' *format*
     `SECOND'                           `SECONDS'
     `MINUTE'                           `MINUTES'
     `HOUR'                             `HOURS'
     `DAY'                              `DAYS'
     `MONTH'                            `MONTHS'
     `YEAR'                             `YEARS'
     `MINUTE_SECOND'                    `"MINUTES:SECONDS"'
     `HOUR_MINUTE'                      `"HOURS:MINUTES"'
     `DAY_HOUR'                         `"DAYS HOURS"'
     `YEAR_MONTH'                       `"YEARS-MONTHS"'
     `HOUR_SECOND'                      `"HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS"'
     `DAY_MINUTE'                       `"DAYS HOURS:MINUTES"'
     `DAY_SECOND'                       `"DAYS HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS"'

     MySQL allows any punctuation delimiter in the `expr' format.
     Those shown in the table are the suggested delimiters.  If the
     `date' argument is a `DATE' value and your calculations involve
     only `YEAR', `MONTH', and `DAY' parts (that is, no time parts), the
     result is a `DATE' value.  Otherwise the result is a `DATETIME'
     value:

          mysql> SELECT "1997-12-31 23:59:59" + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
                  -> 1998-01-01 00:00:00
          mysql> SELECT INTERVAL 1 DAY + "1997-12-31";
                  -> 1998-01-01
          mysql> SELECT "1998-01-01" - INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
                 -> 1997-12-31 23:59:59
          mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                                 INTERVAL 1 SECOND);
                  -> 1998-01-01 00:00:00
          mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                                 INTERVAL 1 DAY);
                  -> 1998-01-01 23:59:59
          mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",
                                 INTERVAL "1:1" MINUTE_SECOND);
                  -> 1998-01-01 00:01:00
          mysql> SELECT DATE_SUB("1998-01-01 00:00:00",
                                 INTERVAL "1 1:1:1" DAY_SECOND);
                  -> 1997-12-30 22:58:59
          mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD("1998-01-01 00:00:00",
                                 INTERVAL "-1 10" DAY_HOUR);
                  -> 1997-12-30 14:00:00
          mysql> SELECT DATE_SUB("1998-01-02", INTERVAL 31 DAY);
                  -> 1997-12-02

     If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not
     include all the interval parts that would be expected from the
     `type' keyword), MySQL assumes you have left out the leftmost
     parts of the interval value.  For example, if you specify a `type'
     of `DAY_SECOND', the value of `expr' is expected to have days,
     hours, minutes, and seconds parts.  If you specify a value like
     `"1:10"', MySQL assumes that the days and hours parts are missing
     and the value represents minutes and seconds.  In other words,
     `"1:10" DAY_SECOND' is interpreted in such a way that it is
     equivalent to `"1:10" MINUTE_SECOND'.  This is analogous to the
     way that MySQL interprets `TIME' values as representing elapsed
     time rather than as time of day.

     Note that if you add or subtract a date value against something
     that contains a time part, the date value will be automatically
     converted to a datetime value:

          mysql> select date_add("1999-01-01", interval 1 day);
                 -> 1999-01-02
          mysql> select date_add("1999-01-01", interval 1 hour);
                 -> 1999-01-01 01:00:00

     If you use really incorrect dates, the result is `NULL'. If you add
     `MONTH', `YEAR_MONTH', or `YEAR' and the resulting date has a day
     that is larger than the maximum day for the new month, the day is
     adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:

          mysql> select DATE_ADD('1998-01-30', Interval 1 month);
                  -> 1998-02-28

     Note from the preceding example that the word `INTERVAL' and the
     `type' keyword are not case sensitive.

`EXTRACT(type FROM date)'
     The `EXTRACT()' function uses the same kinds of interval type
     specifiers as `DATE_ADD()' or `DATE_SUB()', but extracts parts
     from the date rather than performing date arithmetic.

          mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "1999-07-02");
                 -> 1999
          mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM "1999-07-02 01:02:03");
                 -> 199907
          mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY_MINUTE FROM "1999-07-02 01:02:03");
                 -> 20102

`TO_DAYS(date)'
     Given a date `date', returns a daynumber (the number of days since
     year 0):

          mysql> select TO_DAYS(950501);
                  -> 728779
          mysql> select TO_DAYS('1997-10-07');
                  -> 729669

     `TO_DAYS()' is not intended for use with values that precede the
     advent of the Gregorian calendar (1582), because it doesn't take
     into account the days that were lost when the calendar was changed.

`FROM_DAYS(N)'
     Given a daynumber `N', returns a `DATE' value:

          mysql> select FROM_DAYS(729669);
                  -> '1997-10-07'

     `FROM_DAYS()' is not intended for use with values that precede the
     advent of the Gregorian calendar (1582), because it doesn't take
     into account the days that were lost when the calendar was changed.

`DATE_FORMAT(date,format)'
     Formats the `date' value according to the `format' string. The
     following specifiers may be used in the `format' string:
     `%M'    Month name (`January'..`December')
     `%W'    Weekday name (`Sunday'..`Saturday')
     `%D'    Day of the month with English suffix
             (`1st', `2nd', `3rd', etc.)
     `%Y'    Year, numeric, 4 digits
     `%y'    Year, numeric, 2 digits
     `%X'    Year for the week where Sunday is the
             first day of the week, numeric, 4
             digits, used with '%V'
     `%x'    Year for the week, where Monday is the
             first day of the week, numeric, 4
             digits, used with '%v'
     `%a'    Abbreviated weekday name (`Sun'..`Sat')
     `%d'    Day of the month, numeric (`00'..`31')
     `%e'    Day of the month, numeric (`0'..`31')
     `%m'    Month, numeric (`01'..`12')
     `%c'    Month, numeric (`1'..`12')
     `%b'    Abbreviated month name (`Jan'..`Dec')
     `%j'    Day of year (`001'..`366')
     `%H'    Hour (`00'..`23')
     `%k'    Hour (`0'..`23')
     `%h'    Hour (`01'..`12')
     `%I'    Hour (`01'..`12')
     `%l'    Hour (`1'..`12')
     `%i'    Minutes, numeric (`00'..`59')
     `%r'    Time, 12-hour (`hh:mm:ss [AP]M')
     `%T'    Time, 24-hour (`hh:mm:ss')
     `%S'    Seconds (`00'..`59')
     `%s'    Seconds (`00'..`59')
     `%p'    `AM' or `PM'
     `%w'    Day of the week
             (`0'=Sunday..`6'=Saturday)
     `%U'    Week (`0'..`53'), where Sunday is the
             first day of the week
     `%u'    Week (`0'..`53'), where Monday is the
             first day of the week
     `%V'    Week (`1'..`53'), where Sunday is the
             first day of the week. Used with '%X'
     `%v'    Week (`1'..`53'), where Monday is the
             first day of the week. Used with '%x'
     `%%'    A literal `%'.

     All other characters are just copied to the result without
     interpretation:

          mysql> select DATE_FORMAT('1997-10-04 22:23:00', '%W %M %Y');
                  -> 'Saturday October 1997'
          mysql> select DATE_FORMAT('1997-10-04 22:23:00', '%H:%i:%s');
                  -> '22:23:00'
          mysql> select DATE_FORMAT('1997-10-04 22:23:00',
                                    '%D %y %a %d %m %b %j');
                  -> '4th 97 Sat 04 10 Oct 277'
          mysql> select DATE_FORMAT('1997-10-04 22:23:00',
                                    '%H %k %I %r %T %S %w');
                  -> '22 22 10 10:23:00 PM 22:23:00 00 6'
          mysql> select DATE_FORMAT('1999-01-01', '%X %V');
                  -> '1998 52'

     As of MySQL Version 3.23, the `%' character is required before
     format specifier characters.  In earlier versions of MySQL, `%'
     was optional.

`TIME_FORMAT(time,format)'
     This is used like the `DATE_FORMAT()' function above, but the
     `format' string may contain only those format specifiers that
     handle hours, minutes, and seconds.  Other specifiers produce a
     `NULL' value or `0'.

`CURDATE()'
`CURRENT_DATE'
     Returns today's date as a value in `'YYYY-MM-DD'' or `YYYYMMDD'
     format, depending on whether the function is used in a string or
     numeric context:

          mysql> select CURDATE();
                  -> '1997-12-15'
          mysql> select CURDATE() + 0;
                  -> 19971215

`CURTIME()'
`CURRENT_TIME'
     Returns the current time as a value in `'HH:MM:SS'' or `HHMMSS'
     format, depending on whether the function is used in a string or
     numeric context:

          mysql> select CURTIME();
                  -> '23:50:26'
          mysql> select CURTIME() + 0;
                  -> 235026

`NOW()'
`SYSDATE()'
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'
     Returns the current date and time as a value in `'YYYY-MM-DD
     HH:MM:SS'' or `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' format, depending on whether the
     function is used in a string or numeric context:

          mysql> select NOW();
                  -> '1997-12-15 23:50:26'
          mysql> select NOW() + 0;
                  -> 19971215235026

`UNIX_TIMESTAMP()'
`UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date)'
     If called with no argument, returns a Unix timestamp (seconds since
     `'1970-01-01 00:00:00'' GMT). If `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()' is called with
     a `date' argument, it returns the value of the argument as seconds
     since `'1970-01-01 00:00:00'' GMT.  `date' may be a `DATE' string,
     a `DATETIME' string, a `TIMESTAMP', or a number in the format
     `YYMMDD' or `YYYYMMDD' in local time:

          mysql> select UNIX_TIMESTAMP();
                  -> 882226357
          mysql> select UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1997-10-04 22:23:00');
                  -> 875996580

     When `UNIX_TIMESTAMP' is used on a `TIMESTAMP' column, the function
     will receive the value directly, with no implicit
     "string-to-unix-timestamp" conversion.  If you give
     `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()' a wrong or out-of-range date, it will return 0.

`FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp)'
     Returns a representation of the `unix_timestamp' argument as a
     value in `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'' or `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' format,
     depending on whether the function is used in a string or numeric
     context:

          mysql> select FROM_UNIXTIME(875996580);
                  -> '1997-10-04 22:23:00'
          mysql> select FROM_UNIXTIME(875996580) + 0;
                  -> 19971004222300

`FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp,format)'
     Returns a string representation of the Unix timestamp, formatted
     according to the `format' string. `format' may contain the same
     specifiers as those listed in the entry for the `DATE_FORMAT()'
     function:

          mysql> select FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(),
                                      '%Y %D %M %h:%i:%s %x');
                  -> '1997 23rd December 03:43:30 x'

`SEC_TO_TIME(seconds)'
     Returns the `seconds' argument, converted to hours, minutes, and
     seconds, as a value in `'HH:MM:SS'' or `HHMMSS' format, depending
     on whether the function is used in a string or numeric context:

          mysql> select SEC_TO_TIME(2378);
                  -> '00:39:38'
          mysql> select SEC_TO_TIME(2378) + 0;
                  -> 3938

`TIME_TO_SEC(time)'
     Returns the `time' argument, converted to seconds:

          mysql> select TIME_TO_SEC('22:23:00');
                  -> 80580
          mysql> select TIME_TO_SEC('00:39:38');
                  -> 2378

Bit Functions
.............

MySQL uses `BIGINT' (64-bit) arithmetic for bit operations, so these
operators have a maximum range of 64 bits.

`|'
     Bitwise OR:
          mysql> select 29 | 15;
                  -> 31

`&'
     Bitwise AND:
          mysql> select 29 & 15;
                  -> 13

`<<'
     Shifts a longlong (`BIGINT') number to the left:
          mysql> select 1 << 2;
                  -> 4

`>>'
     Shifts a longlong (`BIGINT') number to the right:
          mysql> select 4 >> 2;
                  -> 1

`~'
     Invert all bits:
          mysql> select 5 & ~1;
                  -> 4

`BIT_COUNT(N)'
     Returns the number of bits that are set in the argument `N':
          mysql> select BIT_COUNT(29);
                  -> 4

Miscellaneous Functions
.......................

`DATABASE()'
     Returns the current database name:

          mysql> select DATABASE();
                  -> 'test'

     If there is no current database, `DATABASE()' returns the empty
     string.

`USER()'
`SYSTEM_USER()'
`SESSION_USER()'
     Returns the current MySQL user name:

          mysql> select USER();
                  -> 'davida@localhost'

     In MySQL Version 3.22.11 or later, this includes the client
     hostname as well  as the user name.  You can extract just the user
     name part like this (which works whether or not the value includes
     a hostname part):

          mysql> select substring_index(USER(),"@",1);
                  -> 'davida'

`PASSWORD(str)'
     Calculates a password string from the plaintext password `str'.
     This is the function that is used for encrypting MySQL passwords
     for storage in the `Password' column of the `user' grant table:

          mysql> select PASSWORD('badpwd');
                  -> '7f84554057dd964b'

     `PASSWORD()' encryption is non-reversible.

     `PASSWORD()' does not perform password encryption in the same way
     that Unix passwords are encrypted.  You should not assume that if
     your Unix password and your MySQL password are the same,
     `PASSWORD()' will result in the same encrypted value as is stored
     in the Unix password file.  See `ENCRYPT()'.

`ENCRYPT(str[,salt])'
     Encrypt `str' using the Unix `crypt()' system call. The `salt'
     argument should be a string with two characters.  (As of MySQL
     Version 3.22.16, `salt' may be longer than two characters.):

          mysql> select ENCRYPT("hello");
                  -> 'VxuFAJXVARROc'

     If `crypt()' is not available on your system, `ENCRYPT()' always
     returns `NULL'.

     `ENCRYPT()' ignores all but the first 8 characters of `str', at
     least on some systems.  This will be determined by the behavior of
     the underlying `crypt()' system call.

`ENCODE(str,pass_str)'
     Encrypt `str' using `pass_str' as the password.  To decrypt the
     result, use `DECODE()'.

     The results is a binary string of the same length as `string'.  If
     you want to save it in a column, use a `BLOB' column type.

`DECODE(crypt_str,pass_str)'
     Descrypts the encrypted string `crypt_str' using `pass_str' as the
     password.  `crypt_str' should be a string returned from `ENCODE()'.

`MD5(string)'
     Calculates a MD5 checksum for the string. Value is returned as a
     32 long hex number that may, for example, be used as a hash key:

          mysql> select MD5("testing");
                  -> 'ae2b1fca515949e5d54fb22b8ed95575'

     This is an "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm".

`LAST_INSERT_ID([expr])'
     Returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted
     into an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column.  *Note `mysql_insert_id()':
     mysql_insert_id.

          mysql> select LAST_INSERT_ID();
                  -> 195

     The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a
     per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client.
     It will not even be changed if you update another `AUTO_INCREMENT'
     column with a non-magic value (that is, a value that is not `NULL'
     and not `0').

     If you insert many rows at the same time with an insert statement,
     `LAST_INSERT_ID()' returns the value for the first inserted row.
     The reason for this is so that you it makes it possible to easily
     reproduce the same `INSERT' statement against some other server.

     If `expr' is given as an argument to `LAST_INSERT_ID()', then the
     value of the argument is returned by the function, is set as the
     next value to be returned by `LAST_INSERT_ID()' and used as the
     next auto_increment value.  This can be used to simulate sequences:

     First create the table:

          mysql> create table sequence (id int not null);
          mysql> insert into sequence values (0);

     Then the table can be used to generate sequence numbers like this:

          mysql> update sequence set id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id+1);

     You can generate sequences without calling `LAST_INSERT_ID()', but
     the utility of using the function this way is that the ID value is
     maintained in the server as the last automatically generated
     value.  You can retrieve the new ID as you would read any normal
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' value in MySQL.  For example, `LAST_INSERT_ID()'
     (without an argument) will return the new ID.  The C API function
     `mysql_insert_id()' can also be used to get the value.

     Note that as `mysql_insert_id()' is only updated after `INSERT'
     and `UPDATE' statements, you can't use this function to retrieve
     the value for `LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)' after executing other SQL
     statements like `SELECT' or `SET'.

`FORMAT(X,D)'
     Formats the number `X' to a format like `'#,###,###.##'', rounded
     to `D' decimals.  If `D' is `0', the result will have no decimal
     point or fractional part:

          mysql> select FORMAT(12332.123456, 4);
                  -> '12,332.1235'
          mysql> select FORMAT(12332.1,4);
                  -> '12,332.1000'
          mysql> select FORMAT(12332.2,0);
                  -> '12,332'

`VERSION()'
     Returns a string indicating the MySQL server version:

          mysql> select VERSION();
                  -> '3.23.13-log'

     Note that if your version ends with `-log' this means that logging
     is enabled.

`CONNECTION_ID()'
     Returns the connection id (`thread_id') for the connection.  Every
     connection has its own unique id:

          mysql> select CONNECTION_ID();
                  -> 1

`GET_LOCK(str,timeout)'
     Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string `str', with
     a timeout of `timeout' seconds.  Returns `1' if the lock was
     obtained successfully, `0' if the attempt timed out, or `NULL' if
     an error occurred (such as running out of memory or the thread was
     killed with `mysqladmin kill').  A lock is released when you
     execute `RELEASE_LOCK()', execute a new `GET_LOCK()', or the thread
     terminates.  This function can be used to implement application
     locks or to simulate record locks.  It blocks requests by other
     clients for locks with the same name; clients that agree on a
     given lock string name can use the string to perform cooperative
     advisory locking:

          mysql> select GET_LOCK("lock1",10);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select GET_LOCK("lock2",10);
                  -> 1
          mysql> select RELEASE_LOCK("lock2");
                  -> 1
          mysql> select RELEASE_LOCK("lock1");
                  -> NULL

     Note that the second `RELEASE_LOCK()' call returns `NULL' because
     the lock `"lock1"' was automatically released by the second
     `GET_LOCK()' call.

`RELEASE_LOCK(str)'
     Releases the lock named by the string `str' that was obtained with
     `GET_LOCK()'. Returns `1' if the lock was released, `0' if the
     lock wasn't locked by this thread (in which case the lock is not
     released), and `NULL' if the named lock didn't exist.  The lock
     will not exist if it was never obtained by a call to `GET_LOCK()'
     or if it already has been released.

     The `DO' statement is convinient to use with `RELEASE_LOCK()'.
     *Note DO::.

`BENCHMARK(count,expr)'
     The `BENCHMARK()' function executes the expression `expr'
     repeatedly `count' times.  It may be used to time how fast MySQL
     processes the expression.  The result value is always `0'.  The
     intended use is in the `mysql' client, which reports query
     execution times:

          mysql> select BENCHMARK(1000000,encode("hello","goodbye"));
          +----------------------------------------------+
          | BENCHMARK(1000000,encode("hello","goodbye")) |
          +----------------------------------------------+
          |                                            0 |
          +----------------------------------------------+
          1 row in set (4.74 sec)

     The time reported is elapsed time on the client end, not CPU time
     on the server end.  It may be advisable to execute `BENCHMARK()'
     several times, and interpret the result with regard to how heavily
     loaded the server machine is.

`INET_NTOA(expr)'
     Returns the network address (4 or 8 byte) for the numeric
     expression:

          mysql> select INET_NTOA(3520061480);
                 ->  "209.207.224.40"

`INET_ATON(expr)'
     Returns an integer that represents the numeric value for a network
     address.  Addresses may be 4 or 8 byte addresses:

          mysql> select INET_ATON("209.207.224.40");
                 ->  3520061480

     The generated number is always in network byte order; For example
     the above number is calculated as `209*256^3 + 207*256^2 + 224*256
     +40'.

`MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name, log_pos)'
     Blocks until the slave reaches the specified position in the
     master log during replication. If master information is not
     initialized, returns NULL. If the slave is not running, will block
     and wait until it is started and goes to or past the specified
     position. If the slave is already past the specified position,
     returns immediately. The return value is the number of log events
     it had to wait to get to the specified position, or NULL in case
     of error. Useful for control of master-slave synchronization, but
     was originally written to facilitate replication testing.

`SELECT' is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.
`select_expression' indicates the columns you want to retrieve.
`SELECT' may also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.  For example:

     mysql> SELECT 1 + 1;
              -> 2

All keywords used must be given in exactly the order shown above. For
example, a `HAVING' clause must come after any `GROUP BY' clause and
before any `ORDER BY' clause.

   * A `SELECT' expression may be given an alias using `AS'. The alias
     is used as the expression's column name and can be used with
     `ORDER BY' or `HAVING' clauses.  For example:

          mysql> select concat(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
              from mytable ORDER BY full_name;

   * The `FROM table_references' clause indicates the tables from which
     to retrieve rows.  If you name more than one table, you are
     performing a join.  For information on join syntax, see *Note
     `JOIN': JOIN.

   * You can refer to a column as `col_name', `tbl_name.col_name', or
     `db_name.tbl_name.col_name'.  You need not specify a `tbl_name' or
     `db_name.tbl_name' prefix for a column reference in a `SELECT'
     statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.  See *Note
     Legal names::, for examples of ambiguity that require the more
     explicit column reference forms.

   * A table reference may be aliased using `tbl_name [AS] alias_name':

          mysql> select t1.name, t2.salary from employee AS t1, info AS t2
                     where t1.name = t2.name;
          mysql> select t1.name, t2.salary from employee t1, info t2
                     where t1.name = t2.name;

   * Columns selected for output may be referred to in `ORDER BY' and
     `GROUP BY' clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
     positions.  Column positions begin with 1:

          mysql> select college, region, seed from tournament
                     ORDER BY region, seed;
          mysql> select college, region AS r, seed AS s from tournament
                     ORDER BY r, s;
          mysql> select college, region, seed from tournament
                     ORDER BY 2, 3;

     To sort in reverse order, add the `DESC' (descending) keyword to
     the name of the column in the `ORDER BY' clause that you are
     sorting by.  The default is ascending order; this may be specified
     explicitly using the `ASC' keyword.

   * You can in the `WHERE' clause use any of the functions that MySQL
     support. *Note Functions::.

   * The `HAVING' clause can refer to any column or alias named in the
     `select_expression'. It is applied last, just before items are
     sent to the client, with no optimization. Don't use `HAVING' for
     items that should be in the `WHERE' clause.  For example, do not
     write this:

          mysql> select col_name from tbl_name HAVING col_name > 0;

     Write this instead:

          mysql> select col_name from tbl_name WHERE col_name > 0;

     In MySQL Version 3.22.5 or later, you can also write queries like
     this:

          mysql> select user,max(salary) from users
                     group by user HAVING max(salary)>10;

     In older MySQL versions, you can write this instead:

          mysql> select user,max(salary) AS sum from users
                     group by user HAVING sum>10;

   * `SQL_SMALL_RESULT', `SQL_BIG_RESULT', `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT',
     `STRAIGHT_JOIN', and `HIGH_PRIORITY' are MySQL extensions to ANSI
     SQL92.

   * `HIGH_PRIORITY' will give the `SELECT' higher priority than a
     statement that updates a table.  You should only use this for
     queries that are very fast and must be done at once.  A `SELECT
     HIGH_PRIORITY' query will run if the table is locked for read even
     if there is an update statement that is waiting for the table to
     be free.

   * `SQL_BIG_RESULT' can be used with `GROUP BY' or `DISTINCT' to tell
     the optimizer that the result set will have many rows.  In this
     case, MySQL will directly use disk-based temporary tables if
     needed.  MySQL will also, in this case, prefer sorting to doing a
     temporary table with a key on the `GROUP BY' elements.

   * `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT' will force the result to be put into a
     temporary table. This will help MySQL free the table locks early
     and will help in cases where it takes a long time to send the
     result set to the client.

   * `SQL_SMALL_RESULT', a MySQL-specific option, can be used with
     `GROUP BY' or `DISTINCT' to tell the optimizer that the result set
     will be small.  In this case, MySQL will use fast temporary tables
     to store the resulting table instead of using sorting. In MySQL
     Version 3.23 this shouldn't normally be needed.

   * If you use `GROUP BY', the output rows will be sorted according to
     the `GROUP BY' as if you would have had an `ORDER BY' over all the
     fields in the `GROUP BY'. MySQL has extended the `GROUP BY' so that
     you can also specify `ASC' and `DESC' to `GROUP BY':

          SELECT a,COUNT(b) FROM test_table GROUP BY a DESC

   * MySQL has extended the use of `GROUP BY' to allow you to select
     fields which are not mentioned in the `GROUP BY' clause.  If you
     are not getting the results you expect from your query, please
     read the `GROUP BY' description.  *Note Group by functions::.

   * `STRAIGHT_JOIN' forces the optimizer to join the tables in the
     order in which they are listed in the `FROM' clause. You can use
     this to speed up a query if the optimizer joins the tables in
     non-optimal order.  *Note `EXPLAIN': EXPLAIN.

   * The `LIMIT' clause can be used to constrain the number of rows
     returned by the `SELECT' statement.  `LIMIT' takes one or two
     numeric arguments.

     If two arguments are given, the first specifies the offset of the
     first row to return, the second specifies the maximum number of
     rows to return.  The offset of the initial row is 0 (not 1):

          mysql> select * from table LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15

     If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows
     to return:

          mysql> select * from table LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows

     In other words, `LIMIT n' is equivalent to `LIMIT 0,n'.

   * The `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'' form of `SELECT' writes
     the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server
     host and cannot already exist (among other things, this prevents
     database tables and files such as `/etc/passwd' from being
     destroyed).  You must have the *file* privilege on the server host
     to use this form of `SELECT'.

     `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' is mainly intended to let you very
     quickly dump a table on the server machine. If you want to create
     the resulting file on some other host than the server host you
     can't use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE'. In this case you should
     instead use some client program like `mysqldump --tab' or `mysql
     -e "SELECT ..." > outfile' to generate the file.

     `SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE' is the complement of `LOAD DATA
     INFILE'; the syntax for the `export_options' part of the statement
     consists of the same `FIELDS' and `LINES' clauses that are used
     with the `LOAD DATA INFILE' statement.  *Note `LOAD DATA': LOAD
     DATA.

     In the resulting text file, only the following characters are
     escaped by the `ESCAPED BY' character:

        * The `ESCAPED BY' character

        * The first character in `FIELDS TERMINATED BY'

        * The first character in `LINES TERMINATED BY'

     Additionally, `ASCII 0' is converted to `ESCAPED BY' followed by 0
     (`ASCII 48').

     The reason for the above is that you MUST escape any `FIELDS
     TERMINATED BY', `ESCAPED BY', or `LINES TERMINATED BY' characters
     to reliably be able to read the file back. `ASCII 0' is escaped to
     make it easier to view with some pagers.

     As the resulting file doesn't have to conform to the SQL syntax,
     nothing else need be escaped.

     Here follows an example of getting a file in the format used by
     many old programs.

          SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/result.text"
          FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
          LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
          FROM test_table;

   * If you use `INTO DUMPFILE' instead of `INTO OUTFILE', MySQL will
     only write one row into the file, without any column or line
     terminations and without any escaping.  This is useful if you want
     to store a blob in a file.

   * Note that any file created by `INTO OUTFILE' and `INTO DUMPFILE'
     is going to be readable for all users!  The reason is that the
     MySQL server can't create a file that is owned by anyone else than
     the user it's running as (you should never run `mysqld' as root),
     the file has to be word readable so that you can retrieve the rows.

   * If you are using `FOR UPDATE' on a table handler with page/row
     locks, the examined rows will be write locked.

File: mysql.info,  Node: JOIN,  Prev: SELECT,  Up: SELECT

`JOIN' Syntax
.............

MySQL supports the following `JOIN' syntaxes for use in `SELECT'
statements:

     table_reference, table_reference
     table_reference [CROSS] JOIN table_reference
     table_reference INNER JOIN table_reference join_condition
     table_reference STRAIGHT_JOIN table_reference
     table_reference LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table_reference join_condition
     table_reference LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table_reference
     table_reference NATURAL [LEFT [OUTER]] JOIN table_reference
     { oj table_reference LEFT OUTER JOIN table_reference ON conditional_expr }
     table_reference RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN table_reference join_condition
     table_reference RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN table_reference
     table_reference NATURAL [RIGHT [OUTER]] JOIN table_reference

Where `table_reference' is defined as:
     table_name [[AS] alias] [USE INDEX (key_list)] [IGNORE INDEX (key_list)]

and `join_condition' is defined as:

     ON conditional_expr |
     USING (column_list)

You should never have any conditions in the `ON' part that are used to
restrict which rows you have in the result set.  If you want to restrict
which rows should be in the result, you have to do this in the `WHERE'
clause.

Note that in versions before Version 3.23.17, the `INNER JOIN' didn't
take a `join_condition'!

The last `LEFT OUTER JOIN' syntax shown above exists only for
compatibility with ODBC:

   * A table reference may be aliased using `tbl_name AS alias_name' or
     `tbl_name alias_name':

          mysql> select t1.name, t2.salary from employee AS t1, info AS t2
                     where t1.name = t2.name;

   * The `ON' conditional is any conditional of the form that may be
     used in a `WHERE' clause.

   * If there is no matching record for the right table in the `ON' or
     `USING' part in a `LEFT JOIN', a row with all columns set to
     `NULL' is used for the right table.  You can use this fact to find
     records in a table that have no counterpart in another table:

          mysql> select table1.* from table1
                     LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
                     where table2.id is NULL;

     This example finds all rows in `table1' with an `id' value that is
     not present in `table2' (that is, all rows in `table1' with no
     corresponding row in `table2').  This assumes that `table2.id' is
     declared `NOT NULL', of course. *Note LEFT JOIN optimization::.

   * The `USING' `(column_list)' clause names a list of columns that
     must exist in both tables.  A `USING' clause such as:

          A LEFT JOIN B USING (C1,C2,C3,...)

     is defined to be semantically identical to an `ON' expression like
     this:

          A.C1=B.C1 AND A.C2=B.C2 AND A.C3=B.C3,...

   * The `NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN' of two tables is defined to be
     semantically equivalent to an `INNER JOIN' or a `LEFT JOIN' with a
     `USING' clause that names all columns that exist in both tables.

   * `RIGHT JOIN' works analogously as `LEFT JOIN'.  To keep code
     portable across databases, it's recommended to use `LEFT JOIN'
     instead of `RIGHT JOIN'.

   * `STRAIGHT_JOIN' is identical to `JOIN', except that the left table
     is always read before the right table. This can be used for those
     (few) cases where the join optimizer puts the tables in the wrong
     order.

   * As of MySQL Version 3.23.12, you can give hints about which index
     MySQL should use when retrieving information from a table. This is
     useful if `EXPLAIN' shows that MySQL is using the wrong index.  By
     specifying `USE INDEX (key_list)', you can tell MySQL to use only
     one of the specified indexes to find rows in the table.  The
     alternative syntax `IGNORE INDEX (key_list)' can be used to tell
     MySQL to not use some particular index.

Some examples:

     mysql> select * from table1,table2 where table1.id=table2.id;
     mysql> select * from table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id;
     mysql> select * from table1 LEFT JOIN table2 USING (id);
     mysql> select * from table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
                LEFT JOIN table3 ON table2.id=table3.id;
     mysql> select * from table1 USE INDEX (key1,key2) WHERE key1=1 and key2=2 AND
            key3=3;
     mysql> select * from table1 IGNORE INDEX (key3) WHERE key1=1 and key2=2 AND
            key3=3;

*Note `LEFT JOIN' optimization: LEFT JOIN optimization.

`INSERT' Syntax
---------------

         INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED] [IGNORE]
             [INTO] tbl_name [(col_name,...)]
             VALUES (expression,...),(...),...
     or  INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED] [IGNORE]
             [INTO] tbl_name [(col_name,...)]
             SELECT ...
     or  INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED] [IGNORE]
             [INTO] tbl_name
             SET col_name=expression, col_name=expression, ...

`INSERT' inserts new rows into an existing table.  The `INSERT ...
VALUES' form of the statement inserts rows based on explicitly
specified values.  The `INSERT ... SELECT' form inserts rows selected
from another table or tables.  The `INSERT ... VALUES' form with
multiple value lists is supported in MySQL Version 3.22.5 or later.
The `col_name=expression' syntax is supported in MySQL Version 3.22.10
or later.

`tbl_name' is the table into which rows should be inserted.  The column
name list or the `SET' clause indicates which columns the statement
specifies values for:

   * If you specify no column list for `INSERT ... VALUES' or `INSERT
     ... SELECT', values for all columns must be provided in the
     `VALUES()' list or by the `SELECT'.  If you don't know the order of
     the columns in the table, use `DESCRIBE tbl_name' to find out.

   * Any column not explicitly given a value is set to its default
     value.  For example, if you specify a column list that doesn't
     name all the columns in the table, unnamed columns are set to
     their default values.  Default value assignment is described in
     *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

   * An `expression' may refer to any column that was set earlier in a
     value list.  For example, you can say this:

          mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(15,col1*2);

     But not this:

          mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);

   * If you specify the keyword `LOW_PRIORITY', execution of the
     `INSERT' is delayed until no other clients are reading from the
     table.  In this case the client has to wait until the insert
     statement is completed, which may take a long time if the table is
     in heavy use. This is in contrast to `INSERT DELAYED', which lets
     the client continue at once.  *Note INSERT DELAYED::.  Note that
     `LOW_PRIORITY' should normally not be used with `MyISAM' tables as
     this disables concurrent inserts. *Note MyISAM::.

   * If you specify the keyword `IGNORE' in an `INSERT' with many value
     rows, any rows that duplicate an existing `PRIMARY' or `UNIQUE'
     key in the table are ignored and are not inserted.  If you do not
     specify `IGNORE', the insert is aborted if there is any row that
     duplicates an existing key value.  You can determine with the C
     API function `mysql_info()' how many rows were inserted into the
     table.

   * If MySQL was configured using the `DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS'
     option, `INSERT' statements generate an error unless you explicitly
     specify values for all columns that require a non-`NULL' value.
     *Note `configure' options: configure options.

   * You can find the value used for an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column with
     the `mysql_insert_id' function.  *Note `mysql_insert_id()':
     mysql_insert_id.

If you use `INSERT ... SELECT' or an `INSERT ... VALUES' statement with
multiple value lists, you can use the C API function `mysql_info()' to
get information about the query.  The format of the information string
is shown below:

     Records: 100 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0

`Duplicates' indicates the number of rows that couldn't be inserted
because they would duplicate some existing unique index value.
`Warnings' indicates the number of attempts to insert column values that
were problematic in some way. Warnings can occur under any of the
following conditions:

   * Inserting `NULL' into a column that has been declared `NOT NULL'.
     The column is set to its default value.

   * Setting a numeric column to a value that lies outside the column's
     range.  The value is clipped to the appropriate endpoint of the
     range.

   * Setting a numeric column to a value such as `'10.34 a''.  The
     trailing garbage is stripped and the remaining numeric part is
     inserted.  If the value doesn't make sense as a number at all, the
     column is set to `0'.

   * Inserting a string into a `CHAR', `VARCHAR', `TEXT', or `BLOB'
     column that exceeds the column's maximum length.  The value is
     truncated to the column's maximum length.

   * Inserting a value into a date or time column that is illegal for
     the column type.  The column is set to the appropriate zero value
     for the type.

`INSERT ... SELECT' Syntax
..........................

     INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] [INTO] tbl_name [(column list)] SELECT ...

With `INSERT ... SELECT' statement you can quickly insert many rows
into a table from one or many tables.

     INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID) SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID FROM tblTemp1 WHERE
     tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID > 100;

The following conditions hold for an `INSERT ... SELECT' statement:

   - The target table of the `INSERT' statement cannot appear in the
     `FROM' clause of the `SELECT' part of the query because it's
     forbidden in ANSI SQL to `SELECT' from the same table into which
     you are inserting.  (The problem is that the `SELECT' possibly
     would find records that were inserted earlier during the same run.
     When using sub-select clauses, the situation could easily be very
     confusing!)

   - `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns work as usual.

   - You can use the C API function `mysql_info()' to get information
     about the query. *Note INSERT::.

   - To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create
     the original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
     `INSERT .... SELECT'.

You can of course also use `REPLACE' instead of `INSERT' to overwrite
old rows.


File: mysql.info,  Node: INSERT DELAYED,  Next: UPDATE,  Prev: INSERT,  Up: Data Manipulation

`INSERT DELAYED' syntax
-----------------------

     INSERT DELAYED ...

The `DELAYED' option for the `INSERT' statement is a MySQL-specific
option that is very useful if you have clients that can't wait for the
`INSERT' to complete.  This is a common problem when you use MySQL for
logging and you also periodically run `SELECT' and `UPDATE' statements
that take a long time to complete.  `DELAYED' was introduced in MySQL
Version 3.22.15.  It is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.

`INSERT DELAYED' only works with `ISAM' and `MyISAM' tables.  Note that
as `MyISAM' tables supports concurrent `SELECT' and `INSERT', if there
is no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you very seldom need
to use `INSERT DELAYED' with `MyISAM'. *Note MyISAM::.

When you use `INSERT DELAYED', the client will get an OK at once and
the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by any other
thread.

Another major benefit of using `INSERT DELAYED' is that inserts from
many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much
faster than doing many separate inserts.

Note that currently the queued rows are only stored in memory until
they are inserted into the table.  This means that if you kill `mysqld'
the hard way (`kill -9') or if `mysqld' dies unexpectedly, any queued
rows that weren't written to disk are lost!

The following describes in detail what happens when you use the
`DELAYED' option to `INSERT' or `REPLACE'.  In this description, the
"thread" is the thread that received an `INSERT DELAYED' command and
"handler" is the thread that handles all `INSERT DELAYED' statements
for a particular table.

   * When a thread executes a `DELAYED' statement for a table, a handler
     thread is created to process all `DELAYED' statements for the
     table, if no such handler already exists.

   * The thread checks whether or not the handler has acquired a
     `DELAYED' lock already; if not, it tells the handler thread to do
     so.  The `DELAYED' lock can be obtained even if other threads have
     a `READ' or `WRITE' lock on the table.  However, the handler will
     wait for all `ALTER TABLE' locks or `FLUSH TABLES' to ensure that
     the table structure is up to date.

   * The thread executes the `INSERT' statement, but instead of writing
     the row to the table, it puts a copy of the final row into a queue
     that is managed by the handler thread. Any syntax errors are
     noticed by the thread and reported to the client program.

   * The client can't report the number of duplicates or the
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' value for the resulting row; it can't obtain them
     from the server, because the `INSERT' returns before the insert
     operation has been completed.  If you use the C API, the
     `mysql_info()' function doesn't return anything meaningful, for
     the same reason.

   * The update log is updated by the handler thread when the row is
     inserted into the table.  In case of multiple-row inserts, the
     update log is updated when the first row is inserted.

   * After every `delayed_insert_limit' rows are written, the handler
     checks whether or not any `SELECT' statements are still pending.
     If so, it allows these to execute before continuing.

   * When the handler has no more rows in its queue, the table is
     unlocked.  If no new `INSERT DELAYED' commands are received within
     `delayed_insert_timeout' seconds, the handler terminates.

   * If more than `delayed_queue_size' rows are pending already in a
     specific handler queue, the thread requesting `INSERT DELAYED'
     waits until there is room in the queue.  This is done to ensure
     that the `mysqld' server doesn't use all memory for the delayed
     memory queue.

   * The handler thread will show up in the MySQL process list with
     `delayed_insert' in the `Command' column.  It will be killed if
     you execute a `FLUSH TABLES' command or kill it with `KILL
     thread_id'. However, it will first store all queued rows into the
     table before exiting. During this time it will not accept any new
     `INSERT' commands from another thread. If you execute an `INSERT
     DELAYED' command after this, a new handler thread will be created.

   * Note that the above means that `INSERT DELAYED' commands have
     higher priority than normal `INSERT' commands if there is an
     `INSERT DELAYED' handler already running!  Other update commands
     will have to wait until the `INSERT DELAYED' queue is empty,
     someone kills the handler thread (with `KILL thread_id'), or
     someone executes `FLUSH TABLES'.

   * The following status variables provide information about `INSERT
     DELAYED' commands:

     *Variable*              *Meaning*
     `Delayed_insert_threads'Number of handler threads
     `Delayed_writes'        Number of rows written with `INSERT DELAYED'
     `Not_flushed_delayed_rows'Number of rows waiting to be written

     You can view these variables by issuing a `SHOW STATUS' statement
     or by executing a `mysqladmin extended-status' command.

Note that `INSERT DELAYED' is slower than a normal INSERT if the table
is not in use.  There is also the additional overhead for the server to
handle a separate thread for each table on which you use `INSERT
DELAYED'.  This means that you should only use `INSERT DELAYED' when
you are really sure you need it!


File: mysql.info,  Node: UPDATE,  Next: DELETE,  Prev: INSERT DELAYED,  Up: Data Manipulation

`UPDATE' Syntax
---------------

     UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] tbl_name
         SET col_name1=expr1, [col_name2=expr2, ...]
         [WHERE where_definition]
         [LIMIT #]

`UPDATE' updates columns in existing table rows with new values.  The
`SET' clause indicates which columns to modify and the values they
should be given.  The `WHERE' clause, if given, specifies which rows
should be updated.  Otherwise all rows are updated. If the `ORDER BY'
clause is specified, the rows will be updated in the order that is
specified.

If you specify the keyword `LOW_PRIORITY', execution of the `UPDATE' is
delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

If you specify the keyword `IGNORE', the update statement will not
abort even if we get duplicate key errors during the update.  Rows that
would cause conflicts will not be updated.

If you access a column from `tbl_name' in an expression, `UPDATE' uses
the current value of the column.  For example, the following statement
sets the `age' column to one more than its current value:

     mysql> UPDATE persondata SET age=age+1;

`UPDATE' assignments are evaluated from left to right.  For example, the
following statement doubles the `age' column, then increments it:

     mysql> UPDATE persondata SET age=age*2, age=age+1;

If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices this
and doesn't update it.

`UPDATE' returns the number of rows that were actually changed.  In
MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the C API function `mysql_info()' returns
the number of rows that were matched and updated and the number of
warnings that occurred during the `UPDATE'.

In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use `LIMIT #' to ensure that only a
given number of rows are changed.


File: mysql.info,  Node: DELETE,  Next: TRUNCATE,  Prev: UPDATE,  Up: Data Manipulation

`DELETE' Syntax
---------------

     DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] FROM tbl_name
         [WHERE where_definition]
         [LIMIT rows]

`DELETE' deletes rows from `tbl_name' that satisfy the condition given
by `where_definition', and returns the number of records deleted.

If you issue a `DELETE' with no `WHERE' clause, all rows are deleted.
If you do this in `AUTOCOMMIT' mode, this works as `TRUNCATE'. *Note
TRUNCATE::. One problem with this is that `DELETE' will return zero as
the number of affected records, but this will be fixed in 4.0.

If you really want to know how many records are deleted when you are
deleting all rows, and are willing to suffer a speed penalty, you can
use a `DELETE' statement of this form:

     mysql> DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE 1>0;

Note that this is MUCH slower than `DELETE FROM tbl_name' with no
`WHERE' clause, because it deletes rows one at a time.

If you specify the keyword `LOW_PRIORITY', execution of the `DELETE' is
delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent `INSERT'
operations reuse old record positions. To reclaim unused space and
reduce file sizes, use the `OPTIMIZE TABLE' statement or the `myisamchk'
utility to reorganize tables.  `OPTIMIZE TABLE' is easier, but
`myisamchk' is faster.  See *Note `OPTIMIZE TABLE': OPTIMIZE TABLE and
*Note Optimization::.

The MySQL-specific `LIMIT rows' option to `DELETE' tells the server the
maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is returned to the
client.  This can be used to ensure that a specific `DELETE' command
doesn't take too much time.  You can simply repeat the `DELETE' command
until the number of affected rows is less than the `LIMIT' value.


File: mysql.info,  Node: TRUNCATE,  Next: REPLACE,  Prev: DELETE,  Up: Data Manipulation

`TRUNCATE' Syntax
-----------------

     TRUNCATE TABLE table_name

Is in 3.23 and the same thing as `DELETE FROM table_name'. *Note
DELETE::.  The differences are:

   * Implemented as a drop and re-create of the table, which makes this
     much faster when deleting many rows.

   * Not transaction-safe; `TRUNCATE TABLE' will automatically end the
     current transaction as if `COMMIT' would have been called.

   * Doesn't return the number of deleted rows.

   * As long as the table definition file `table_name.frm' is valid,
     the table can be re-created this way, even if the data or index
     files have become corrupted.

`TRUNCATE' is an Oracle SQL extension.


File: mysql.info,  Node: REPLACE,  Next: LOAD DATA,  Prev: TRUNCATE,  Up: Data Manipulation

`REPLACE' Syntax
----------------

         REPLACE [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED]
             [INTO] tbl_name [(col_name,...)]
             VALUES (expression,...),(...),...
     or  REPLACE [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED]
             [INTO] tbl_name [(col_name,...)]
             SELECT ...
     or  REPLACE [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED]
             [INTO] tbl_name
             SET col_name=expression, col_name=expression,...

`REPLACE' works exactly like `INSERT', except that if an old record in
the table has the same value as a new record on a unique index, the old
record is deleted before the new record is inserted.  *Note `INSERT':
INSERT.

In other words, you can't access the values of the old row from a
`REPLACE' statement.  In some old MySQL version it looked like you
could do this, but that was a bug that has been corrected.

When one uses a `REPLACE' command, `mysql_affected_rows()' will return
2 if the new row replaced and old row.  This is because in this case
one row was inserted and then the duplicate was deleted.

The above makes it easy to check if `REPLACE' added or replaced a row.


File: mysql.info,  Node: LOAD DATA,  Next: DO,  Prev: REPLACE,  Up: Data Manipulation

`LOAD DATA INFILE' Syntax
-------------------------

     LOAD DATA [LOW_PRIORITY | CONCURRENT] [LOCAL] INFILE 'file_name.txt'
         [REPLACE | IGNORE]
         INTO TABLE tbl_name
         [FIELDS
             [TERMINATED BY '\t']
             [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY '']
             [ESCAPED BY '\\' ]
         ]
         [LINES TERMINATED BY '\n']
         [IGNORE number LINES]
         [(col_name,...)]

The `LOAD DATA INFILE' statement reads rows from a text file into a
table at a very high speed.  If the `LOCAL' keyword is specified, the
file is read from the client host.  If `LOCAL' is not specified, the
file must be located on the server.  (`LOCAL' is available in MySQL
Version 3.22.6 or later.)

For security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the
files must either reside in the database directory or be readable by
all.  Also, to use `LOAD DATA INFILE' on server files, you must have the
*file* privilege on the server host.  *Note Privileges provided::.

If you specify the keyword `LOW_PRIORITY', execution of the `LOAD DATA'
statement is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

If you specify the keyword `CONCURRENT' with a `MyISAM' table, then
other threads can retrieve data from the table while `LOAD DATA' is
executing. Using this option will of course affect the performance of
`LOAD DATA' a bit even if no other thread is using the table at the
same time.

Using `LOCAL' will be a bit slower than letting the server access the
files directly, because the contents of the file must travel from the
client host to the server host.  On the other hand, you do not need the
*file* privilege to load local files.

If you are using MySQL before Version 3.23.24 you can't read from a
FIFO with `LOAD DATA INFILE'.  If you need to read from a FIFO (for
example the output from gunzip), use `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE' instead.

You can also load data files by using the `mysqlimport' utility; it
operates by sending a `LOAD DATA INFILE' command to the server.  The
`--local' option causes `mysqlimport' to read data files from the
client host.  You can specify the `--compress' option to get better
performance over slow networks if the client and server support the
compressed protocol.

When locating files on the server host, the server uses the following
rules:

   * If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as
     is.

   * If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is
     given, the server searches for the file relative to the server's
     data directory.

   * If a filename with no leading components is given, the server
     looks for the file in the database directory of the current
     database.

Note that these rules mean a file given as `./myfile.txt' is read from
the server's data directory, whereas a file given as `myfile.txt' is
read from the database directory of the current database.  For example,
the following `LOAD DATA' statement reads the file `data.txt' from the
database directory for `db1' because `db1' is the current database,
even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a table in the
`db2' database:

     mysql> USE db1;
     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "data.txt" INTO TABLE db2.my_table;

The `REPLACE' and `IGNORE' keywords control handling of input records
that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
`REPLACE', new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify `IGNORE', input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either
option, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the
rest of the text file is ignored.

If you load data from a local file using the `LOCAL' keyword, the server
has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the
operation, so the default bahavior is the same as if `IGNORE' is
specified.

If you use `LOAD DATA INFILE' on an empty `MyISAM' table, all
non-unique indexes are created in a separate batch (like in `REPAIR').
This normally makes `LOAD DATA INFILE' much faster when you have many
indexes.

`LOAD DATA INFILE' is the complement of `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE'.
*Note `SELECT': SELECT.  To write data from a database to a file, use
`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE'.  To read the file back into the database,
use `LOAD DATA INFILE'.  The syntax of the `FIELDS' and `LINES' clauses
is the same for both commands.  Both clauses are optional, but `FIELDS'
must precede `LINES' if both are specified.

If you specify a `FIELDS' clause, each of its subclauses (`TERMINATED
BY', `[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY', and `ESCAPED BY') is also optional,
except that you must specify at least one of them.

If you don't specify a `FIELDS' clause, the defaults are the same as if
you had written this:

     FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'

If you don't specify a `LINES' clause, the default is the same as if
you had written this:

     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'

In other words, the defaults cause `LOAD DATA INFILE' to act as follows
when reading input:

   * Look for line boundaries at newlines.

   * Break lines into fields at tabs.

   * Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

   * Interpret occurrences of tab, newline, or `\' preceded by `\' as
     literal characters that are part of field values.

Conversely, the defaults cause `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' to act as
follows when writing output:

   * Write tabs between fields.

   * Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.

   * Use `\' to escape instances of tab, newline or `\' that occur
     within field values.

   * Write newlines at the ends of lines.

Note that to write `FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\\'', you must specify two
backslashes for the value to be read as a single backslash.

The `IGNORE number LINES' option can be used to ignore a header of
column names at the start of the file:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/file_name" into table test IGNORE 1 LINES;

When you use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' in tandem with `LOAD DATA
INFILE' to write data from a database into a file and then read the
file back into the database later, the field and line handling options
for both commands must match.  Otherwise, `LOAD DATA INFILE' will not
interpret the contents of the file properly.  Suppose you use `SELECT
... INTO OUTFILE' to write a file with fields delimited by commas:

     mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
                FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
                FROM ...;

To read the comma-delimited file back in, the correct statement would
be:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
                FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

If instead you tried to read in the file with the statement shown
below, it wouldn't work because it instructs `LOAD DATA INFILE' to look
for tabs between fields:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
                FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';

The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as a
single field.

`LOAD DATA INFILE' can be used to read files obtained from external
sources, too. For example, a file in dBASE format will have fields
separated by commas and enclosed in double quotes.  If lines in the
file are terminated by newlines, the command shown below illustrates
the field and line handling options you would use to load the file:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
                FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
                LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

Any of the field or line handling options may specify an empty string
(`''').  If not empty, the `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY' and
`FIELDS ESCAPED BY' values must be a single character.  The `FIELDS
TERMINATED BY' and `LINES TERMINATED BY' values may be more than one
character.  For example, to write lines that are terminated by carriage
return-linefeed pairs, or to read a file containing such lines, specify
a `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'' clause.

For example, to read a file of jokes, that are separated with a line of
`%%', into a SQL table you can do:

     create table jokes (a int not null auto_increment primary key, joke text
     not null);
     load data infile "/tmp/jokes.txt" into table jokes fields terminated by ""
     lines terminated by "\n%%\n" (joke);

`FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY' controls quoting of fields.  For
output (`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE'), if you omit the word `OPTIONALLY',
all fields are enclosed by the `ENCLOSED BY' character.  An example of
such output (using a comma as the field delimiter) is shown below:

     "1","a string","100.20"
     "2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
     "3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
     "4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"

If you specify `OPTIONALLY', the `ENCLOSED BY' character is used only
to enclose `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' fields:

     1,"a string",100.20
     2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
     3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
     4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20

Note that occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY' character within a field
value are escaped by prefixing them with the `ESCAPED BY' character.
Also note that if you specify an empty `ESCAPED BY' value, it is
possible to generate output that cannot be read properly by `LOAD DATA
INFILE'. For example, the output just shown above would appear as shown
below if the escape character is empty.  Observe that the second field
in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

     1,"a string",100.20
     2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
     3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
     4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20

For input, the `ENCLOSED BY' character, if present, is stripped from the
ends of field values.  (This is true whether or not `OPTIONALLY' is
specified; `OPTIONALLY' has no effect on input interpretation.)
Occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY' character preceded by the `ESCAPED BY'
character are interpreted as part of the current field value.  In
addition, duplicated `ENCLOSED BY' characters occurring within fields
are interpreted as single `ENCLOSED BY' characters if the field itself
starts with that character.  For example, if `ENCLOSED BY '"'' is
specified, quotes are handled as shown below:

     "The ""BIG"" boss"  -> The "BIG" boss
     The "BIG" boss      -> The "BIG" boss
     The ""BIG"" boss    -> The ""BIG"" boss

`FIELDS ESCAPED BY' controls how to write or read special characters.
If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' character is not empty, it is used to prefix
the following characters on output:
   * The `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' character

   * The `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY' character

   * The first character of the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY' and `LINES
     TERMINATED BY' values

   * ASCII `0' (what is actually written following the escape character
     is ASCII `'0'', not a zero-valued byte)

If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' character is empty, no characters are
escaped.  It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape
character, particularly if field values in your data contain any of the
characters in the list just given.

For input, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' character is not empty,
occurrences of that character are stripped and the following character
is taken literally as part of a field value.  The exceptions are an
escaped `0' or `N' (for example, `\0' or `\N' if the escape character is
`\').  These sequences are interpreted as ASCII `0' (a zero-valued
byte) and `NULL'.  See below for the rules on `NULL' handling.

For more information about `\'-escape syntax, see *Note Literals::.

In certain cases, field and line handling options interact:

   * If `LINES TERMINATED BY' is an empty string and `FIELDS TERMINATED
     BY' is non-empty, lines are also terminated with `FIELDS
     TERMINATED BY'.

   * If the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY' and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY' values are
     both empty (`'''), a fixed-row (non-delimited) format is used.
     With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields.
     Instead, column values are written and read using the "display"
     widths of the columns.  For example, if a column is declared as
     `INT(7)', values for the column are written using 7-character
     fields.  On input, values for the column are obtained by reading 7
     characters.  Fixed-row format also affects handling of `NULL'
     values; see below.  Note that fixed-size format will not work if
     you are using a multi-byte character set.

Handling of `NULL' values varies, depending on the `FIELDS' and `LINES'
options you use:

   * For the default `FIELDS' and `LINES' values, `NULL' is written as
     `\N' for output and `\N' is read as `NULL' for input (assuming the
     `ESCAPED BY' character is `\').

   * If `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY' is not empty, a field containing the
     literal word `NULL' as its value is read as a `NULL' value (this
     differs from the word `NULL' enclosed within `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY'
     characters, which is read as the string `'NULL'').

   * If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' is empty, `NULL' is written as the word
     `NULL'.

   * With fixed-row format (which happens when `FIELDS TERMINATED BY'
     and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY' are both empty), `NULL' is written as an
     empty string.  Note that this causes both `NULL' values and empty
     strings in the table to be indistinguishable when written to the
     file because they are both written as empty strings.  If you need
     to be able to tell the two apart when reading the file back in,
     you should not use fixed-row format.

Some cases are not supported by `LOAD DATA INFILE':
   * Fixed-size rows (`FIELDS TERMINATED BY' and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY'
     both empty) and `BLOB' or `TEXT' columns.

   * If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of
     another, `LOAD DATA INFILE' won't be able to interpret the input
     properly.  For example, the following `FIELDS' clause would cause
     problems:

          FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'

   * If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY' is empty, a field value that contains an
     occurrence of `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY' or `LINES TERMINATED BY'
     followed by the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY' value will cause `LOAD DATA
     INFILE' to stop reading a field or line too early.  This happens
     because `LOAD DATA INFILE' cannot properly determine where the
     field or line value ends.

The following example loads all columns of the `persondata' table:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;

No field list is specified, so `LOAD DATA INFILE' expects input rows to
contain a field for each table column.  The default `FIELDS' and
`LINES' values are used.

If you wish to load only some of a table's columns, specify a field
list:

     mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt'
                INTO TABLE persondata (col1,col2,...);

You must also specify a field list if the order of the fields in the
input file differs from the order of the columns in the table.
Otherwise, MySQL cannot tell how to match up input fields with table
columns.

If a row has too few fields, the columns for which no input field is
present are set to default values.  Default value assignment is
described in *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

An empty field value is interpreted differently than if the field value
is missing:

   * For string types, the column is set to the empty string.

   * For numeric types, the column is set to `0'.

   * For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate
     "zero" value for the type.  *Note Date and time types::.

Note that these are the same values that result if you assign an empty
string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly
in an `INSERT' or `UPDATE' statement.

`TIMESTAMP' columns are only set to the current date and time if there
is a `NULL' value for the column, or (for the first `TIMESTAMP' column
only) if the `TIMESTAMP' column is left out from the field list when a
field list is specified.

If an input row has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and
the number of warnings is incremented.

`LOAD DATA INFILE' regards all input as strings, so you can't use
numeric values for `ENUM' or `SET' columns the way you can with
`INSERT' statements.  All `ENUM' and `SET' values must be specified as
strings!

If you are using the C API, you can get information about the query by
calling the API function `mysql_info()' when the `LOAD DATA INFILE'
query finishes.  The format of the information string is shown below:

     Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted
via the `INSERT' statement (*note `INSERT': INSERT.), except that `LOAD
DATA INFILE' also generates warnings when there are too few or too many
fields in the input row.  The warnings are not stored anywhere; the
number of warnings can only be used as an indication if everything went
well.  If you get warnings and want to know exactly why you got them,
one way to do this is to use `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' into another
file and compare this to your original input file.

If you need `LOAD DATA' to read from a pipe, you can use the following
trick:

     mkfifo /mysql/db/x/x
     chmod 666 /mysql/db/x/x
     cat < /dev/tcp/10.1.1.12/4711 > /nt/mysql/db/x/x
     mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'x' INTO TABLE x" x

If you are using a version of MySQL older than 3.23.25 you can only do
the above with `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE'.

`DO' Syntax
-----------

     DO expression, [expression, ...]

Execute the expression but don't return any results.  This is a
shorthand of `SELECT expression, expression', but has the advantage
that it's slightly faster when you don't care about the result.

This is mainly useful with functions that has side effects, like
`RELEASE_LOCK'.

`CREATE DATABASE' Syntax
------------------------

     CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name

`CREATE DATABASE' creates a database with the given name.  Rules for
allowable database names are given in *Note Legal names::.  An error
occurs if the database already exists and you didn't specify `IF NOT
EXISTS'.

Databases in MySQL are implemented as directories containing files that
correspond to tables in the database.  Because there are no tables in a
database when it is initially created, the `CREATE DATABASE' statement
only creates a directory under the MySQL data directory.

You can also create databases with `mysqladmin'.  *Note Client-Side
Scripts::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: DROP DATABASE,  Next: CREATE TABLE,  Prev: CREATE DATABASE,  Up: Data Definition

`DROP DATABASE' Syntax
----------------------

     DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] db_name

`DROP DATABASE' drops all tables in the database and deletes the
database.  If you do a `DROP DATABASE' on a symbolic linked database,
both the link and the original database is deleted. *Be VERY careful
with this command!*

`DROP DATABASE' returns the number of files that were removed from the
database directory.  Normally, this is three times the number of
tables, because normally each table corresponds to a `.MYD' file, a
`.MYI' file, and a `.frm' file.

The `DROP DATABASE' command removes from the given database directory
all files with the following extensions:

.BAK               .DAT               .HSH               .ISD
.ISM               .ISM               .MRG               .MYD
.MYI               .db                .frm               

All subdirectories that consists of 2 digits (`RAID' directories) are
also removed.

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use the keywords `IF EXISTS' to
prevent an error from occurring if the database doesn't exist.

You can also drop databases with `mysqladmin'. *Note Client-Side

`CREATE TABLE' creates a table with the given name in the current
database.  Rules for allowable table names are given in *Note Legal
names::.  An error occurs if there is no current database or if the
table already exists.

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the table name can be specified as
`db_name.tbl_name'.  This works whether or not there is a current
database.

In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use the `TEMPORARY' keyword when you
create a table.  A temporary table will automatically be deleted if a
connection dies and the name is per connection.  This means that two
different connections can both use the same temporary table name
without conflicting with each other or with an existing table of the
same name. (The existing table is hidden until the temporary table is
deleted).

In MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can use the keywords `IF NOT
EXISTS' so that an error does not occur if the table already exists.
Note that there is no verification that the table structures are
identical.

Each table `tbl_name' is represented by some files in the database
directory. In the case of MyISAM-type tables you will get:

*File*         *Purpose*
`tbl_name.frm' Table definition (form) file
`tbl_name.MYD' Data file
`tbl_name.MYI' Index file

For more information on the properties of the various column types, see
*Note Column types:::

   * If neither `NULL' nor `NOT NULL' is specified, the column is
     treated as though `NULL' had been specified.

   * An integer column may have the additional attribute
     `AUTO_INCREMENT'.  When you insert a value of `NULL' (recommended)
     or `0' into an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column, the column is set to
     `value+1', where `value' is the largest value for the column
     currently in the table.  `AUTO_INCREMENT' sequences begin with `1'.
     *Note `mysql_insert_id()': mysql_insert_id.

     If you delete the row containing the maximum value for an
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' column, the value will be reused with an `ISAM',
     or `BDB' table but not with a `MyISAM' or `InnoDB' table.  If you
     delete all rows in the table with `DELETE FROM table_name'
     (without a `WHERE') in `AUTOCOMMIT' mode, the sequence starts over
     for all table types.

     *NOTE:* There can be only one `AUTO_INCREMENT' column per table,
     and it must be indexed. MySQL Version 3.23 will also only work
     properly if the auto_increment column only has positive values.
     Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large
     positive number.  This is done to avoid precision problems when
     numbers 'wrap' over from positive to negative and also to ensure
     that one doesn't accidentally get an auto_increment column that
     contains 0.

     To make MySQL compatible with some ODBC applications, you can find
     the last inserted row with the following query:

          SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL

   * `NULL' values are handled differently for `TIMESTAMP' columns than
     for other column types.  You cannot store a literal `NULL' in a
     `TIMESTAMP' column; setting the column to `NULL' sets it to the
     current date and time.  Because `TIMESTAMP' columns behave this
     way, the `NULL' and `NOT NULL' attributes do not apply in the
     normal way and are ignored if you specify them.

     On the other hand, to make it easier for MySQL clients to use
     `TIMESTAMP' columns, the server reports that such columns may be
     assigned `NULL' values (which is true), even though `TIMESTAMP'
     never actually will contain a `NULL' value.  You can see this when
     you use `DESCRIBE tbl_name' to get a description of your table.

     Note that setting a `TIMESTAMP' column to `0' is not the same as
     setting it to `NULL', because `0' is a valid `TIMESTAMP' value.

   * If no `DEFAULT' value is specified for a column, MySQL
     automatically assigns one.

     If the column may take `NULL' as a value, the default value is
     `NULL'.

     If the column is declared as `NOT NULL', the default value depends
     on the column type:

        - For numeric types other than those declared with the
          `AUTO_INCREMENT' attribute, the default is `0'.  For an
          `AUTO_INCREMENT' column, the default value is the next value
          in the sequence.

        - For date and time types other than `TIMESTAMP', the default
          is the appropriate zero value for the type.  For the first
          `TIMESTAMP' column in a table, the default value is the
          current date and time.  *Note Date and time types::.

        - For string types other than `ENUM', the default value is the
          empty string.  For `ENUM', the default is the first
          enumeration value.

     Default values must be constants. This means, for example, that
     you cannot set the default for a date column to be the value of a
     function such as `NOW()' or `CURRENT_DATE'.

   * `KEY' is a synonym for `INDEX'.

   * In MySQL, a `UNIQUE' key can have only distinct values. An error
     occurs if you try to add a new row with a key that matches an
     existing row.

   * A `PRIMARY KEY' is a unique `KEY' with the extra constraint that
     all key columns must be defined as `NOT NULL'.  In MySQL the key
     is named `PRIMARY'. A table can have only one `PRIMARY KEY'.  If
     you don't have a `PRIMARY KEY' and some applications ask for the
     `PRIMARY KEY' in your tables, MySQL will return the first `UNIQUE'
     key, which doesn't have any `NULL' columns, as the `PRIMARY KEY'.

   * A `PRIMARY KEY' can be a multiple-column index.  However, you
     cannot create a multiple-column index using the `PRIMARY KEY' key
     attibute in a column specification.  Doing so will mark only that
     single column as primary.  You must use the `PRIMARY
     KEY(index_col_name, ...)' syntax.

   * If the `PRIMARY' or `UNIQUE' key consists of only one column and
     this is of type integer, you can also refer to it as `_rowid' (new
     in Version 3.23.11).

   * If you don't assign a name to an index, the index will be assigned
     the same name as the first `index_col_name', with an optional
     suffix (`_2', `_3', `...') to make it unique.  You can see index
     names for a table using `SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name'.  *Note `SHOW':
     SHOW.

   * Only the `MyISAM' table type supports indexes on columns that can
     have `NULL' values. In other cases you must declare such columns
     `NOT NULL' or an error results.

   * With `col_name(length)' syntax, you can specify an index that uses
     only a part of a `CHAR' or `VARCHAR' column. This can make the
     index file much smaller.  *Note Indexes::.

   * Only the `MyISAM' table type supports indexing on `BLOB' and
     `TEXT' columns.  When putting an index on a `BLOB' or `TEXT'
     column you MUST always specify the length of the index:
          CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, index(blob_col(10)));

   * When you use `ORDER BY' or `GROUP BY' with a `TEXT' or `BLOB'
     column, only the first `max_sort_length' bytes are used.  *Note
     `BLOB': BLOB.

   * In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
     *FULLTEXT* indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
     `MyISAM' table type supports `FULLTEXT' indexes. They can be
     created only from `VARCHAR' and `TEXT' columns.  Indexing always
     happens over the entire column, partial indexing is not supported.
     See *Note Fulltext Search:: for details of operation.

   * The `FOREIGN KEY', `CHECK', and `REFERENCES' clauses don't
     actually do anything.  The syntax for them is provided only for
     compatibility, to make it easier to port code from other SQL
     servers and to run applications that create tables with references.
     *Note Missing functions::.

   * Each `NULL' column takes one bit extra, rounded up to the nearest
     byte.

   * The maximum record length in bytes can be calculated as follows:

          row length = 1
                       + (sum of column lengths)
                       + (number of NULL columns + 7)/8
                       + (number of variable-length columns)

   * The `table_options' and `SELECT' options are only implemented in
     MySQL Version 3.23 and above.

     The different table types are:

     BDB or        Transaction-safe tables with page locking. *Note
     Berkeley_db   BDB::.
     HEAP          The data for this table is only stored in memory.
                   *Note HEAP::.
     ISAM          The original table handler. *Note ISAM::.
     InnoDB        Transaction-safe tables with row locking. *Note
                   InnoDB::.
     MERGE         A collection of MyISAM tables used as one table.
                   *Note MERGE::.
     MyISAM        The new binary portable table handler that is
                   replacing ISAM. *Note MyISAM::.
     *Note Table types::.

     If a table type is specified, and that particular type is not
     available, MySQL will choose the closest table type to the one
     that you have specified.  For example, if `TYPE=BDB' is specified,
     and that distribution of MySQL does not support `BDB' tables, the
     table will be created as `MyISAM' instead.

     The other table options are used to optimize the behavior of the
     table. In most cases, you don't have to specify any of them.  The
     options work for all table types, if not otherwise indicated:

     `AUTO_INCREMENT'The next auto_increment value you want to set for
                   your table (MyISAM).
     `AVG_ROW_LENGTH'An approximation of the average row length for your
                   table. You only need to set this for large tables
                   with variable size records.
     `CHECKSUM'    Set this to 1 if you want MySQL to maintain a
                   checksum for all rows (makes the table a little
                   slower to update but makes it easier to find
                   corrupted tables) (MyISAM).
     `COMMENT'     A 60-character comment for your table.
     `MAX_ROWS'    Max number of rows you plan to store in the table.
     `MIN_ROWS'    Minimum number of rows you plan to store in the table.
     `PACK_KEYS'   Set this to 1 if you want to have a smaller index.
                   This usually makes updates slower and reads faster
                   (MyISAM, ISAM).
     `PASSWORD'    Encrypt the `.frm' file with a password.  This option
                   doesn't do anything in the standard MySQL version.
     `DELAY_KEY_WRITE'Set this to 1 if want to delay key table updates
                   until the table is closed (MyISAM).
     `ROW_FORMAT'  Defines how the rows should be stored. Currently you
                   can only use the DYNAMIC and STATIC options for
                   MyISAM tables.

     When you use a `MyISAM' table, MySQL uses the product of `max_rows
     * avg_row_length' to decide how big the resulting table will be.
     If you don't specify any of the above options, the maximum size
     for a table will be 4G (or 2G if your operating systems only
     supports 2G tables). The reason for this is just to keep down the
     pointer sizes to make the index smaller and faster if you don't
     really need big files.

     If you don't use `PACK_KEYS', the default is to only pack strings,
     not numbers.  If you use `PACK_KEYS=1', numbers will be packed as
     well.

     When packing binary number keys, MySQL will use prefix compression.
     This means that you will only get a big benefit of this if you have
     many numbers that are the same.  Prefix compression means that
     every key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the
     previous key are the same for the next key (note that the pointer
     to the row is stored in high-byte-first-order directly after the
     key, to improve compression.)  This means that if you have many
     equal keys on two rows in a row, all following 'same' keys will
     usually only take 2 bytes (including the pointer to the row).
     Compare this to the ordinary case where the following keys will
     take storage_size_for_key + pointer_size (usually 4).  On the
     other hand, if all keys are totally different, you will lose 1
     byte per key, if the key isn't a key that can have `NULL' values
     (In this case the packed key length will be stored in the same
     byte that is used to mark if a key is `NULL'.)

   * If you specify a `SELECT' after the `CREATE' statement, MySQL will
     create new fields for all elements in the `SELECT'.  For example:

          mysql> CREATE TABLE test (a int not null auto_increment,
                     primary key (a), key(b))
                     TYPE=MyISAM SELECT b,c from test2;

     This will create a `MyISAM' table with three columns, a, b, and c.
     Notice that the columns from the `SELECT' statement are appended to
     the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it.  Take the
     following example:

          mysql> select * from foo;
          +---+
          | n |
          +---+
          | 1 |
          +---+
          
          mysql> create table bar (m int) select n from foo;
          Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
          Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
          
          mysql> select * from bar;
          +------+---+
          | m    | n |
          +------+---+
          | NULL | 1 |
          +------+---+
          1 row in set (0.00 sec)

     For each row in table `foo', a row is inserted in `bar' with the
     values from `foo' and default values for the new columns.

     `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT' will not automatically create any indexes
     for you.  This is done intentionally to make the command as
     flexible as possible.  If you want to have indexes in the created
     table, you should specify these before the `SELECT' statement:

          mysql> create table bar (unique (n)) select n from foo;

     If any errors occur while copying the data to the table, it will
     automatically be deleted.

     To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create
     the original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
     `CREATE TABLE .... SELECT'.

   * The `RAID_TYPE' option will help you to break the 2G/4G limit for
     the MyISAM data file (not the index file) on operating systems
     that don't support big files. You can get also more speed from the
     I/O bottleneck by putting `RAID' directories on different physical
     disks. `RAID_TYPE' will work on any OS, as long as you have
     configured MySQL with `--with-raid'.  For now the only allowed
     `RAID_TYPE' is `STRIPED' (`1' and `RAID0' are aliases for this).

     If you specify `RAID_TYPE=STRIPED' for a `MyISAM' table, `MyISAM'
     will create `RAID_CHUNKS' subdirectories named 00, 01, 02 in the
     database directory.  In each of these directories `MyISAM' will
     create a `table_name.MYD'.  When writing data to the data file,
     the `RAID' handler will map the first `RAID_CHUNKSIZE' *1024 bytes
     to the first file, the next `RAID_CHUNKSIZE' *1024 bytes to the
     next file and so on.

   * `UNION' is used when you want to use a collection of identical
     tables as one. This only works with MERGE tables. *Note MERGE::.

     For the moment you need to have `SELECT', `UPDATE', and `DELETE'
     privileges on the tables you map to a `MERGE' table.  All mapped
     tables must be in the same database as the `MERGE' table.

   * In the created table the `PRIMARY' key will be placed first,
     followed by all `UNIQUE' keys and then the normal keys.  This
     helps the MySQL optimizer to prioritize which key to use and also
     more quickly detect duplicated `UNIQUE' keys.

   * By using `DATA DIRECTORY="directory"' or `INDEX
     DIRECTORY="directory"' you can specify where the table handler
     should put it's table and index files.  This only works for
     `MyISAM' tables in `MySQL' 4.0, when you are not using the
     `--skip-symlink' option. *Note Symbolic links to tables::.



File: mysql.info,  Node: Silent column changes,  Prev: CREATE TABLE,  Up: CREATE TABLE

Silent Column Specification Changes
...................................

In some cases, MySQL silently changes a column specification from that
given in a `CREATE TABLE' statement.  (This may also occur with `ALTER
TABLE'.):

   * `VARCHAR' columns with a length less than four are changed to
     `CHAR'.

   * If any column in a table has a variable length, the entire row is
     variable-length as a result.  Therefore, if a table contains any
     variable-length columns (`VARCHAR', `TEXT', or `BLOB'), all `CHAR'
     columns longer than three characters are changed to `VARCHAR'
     columns.  This doesn't affect how you use the columns in any way;
     in MySQL, `VARCHAR' is just a different way to store characters.
     MySQL performs this conversion because it saves space and makes
     table operations faster.  *Note Table types::.

   * `TIMESTAMP' display sizes must be even and in the range from 2 to
     14.  If you specify a display size of 0 or greater than 14, the
     size is coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to 13
     are coerced to the next higher even number.

   * You cannot store a literal `NULL' in a `TIMESTAMP' column; setting
     it to `NULL' sets it to the current date and time.  Because
     `TIMESTAMP' columns behave this way, the `NULL' and `NOT NULL'
     attributes do not apply in the normal way and are ignored if you
     specify them.  `DESCRIBE tbl_name' always reports that a
     `TIMESTAMP' column may be assigned `NULL' values.

   * MySQL maps certain column types used by other SQL database vendors
     to MySQL types.  *Note Other-vendor column types::.

If you want to see whether or not MySQL used a column type other than
the one you specified, issue a `DESCRIBE tbl_name' statement after
creating or altering your table.

Certain other column type changes may occur if you compress a table
using `myisampack'. *Note Compressed format::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: ALTER TABLE,  Next: RENAME TABLE,  Prev: CREATE TABLE,  Up: Data Definition

`ALTER TABLE' Syntax
--------------------

     ALTER [IGNORE] TABLE tbl_name alter_spec [, alter_spec ...]
     
     alter_specification:
             ADD [COLUMN] create_definition [FIRST | AFTER column_name ]
       or    ADD [COLUMN] (create_definition, create_definition,...)
       or    ADD INDEX [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
       or    ADD PRIMARY KEY (index_col_name,...)
       or    ADD UNIQUE [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
       or    ADD FULLTEXT [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
       or	ADD [CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY index_name (index_col_name,...)
                 [reference_definition]
       or    ALTER [COLUMN] col_name {SET DEFAULT literal | DROP DEFAULT}
       or    CHANGE [COLUMN] old_col_name create_definition
       or    MODIFY [COLUMN] create_definition
       or    DROP [COLUMN] col_name
       or    DROP PRIMARY KEY
       or    DROP INDEX index_name
       or    RENAME [TO] new_tbl_name
       or    ORDER BY col
       or    table_options

`ALTER TABLE' allows you to change the structure of an existing table.
For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes,
change the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table
itself.  You can also change the comment for the table and type of the
table.  *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

If you use `ALTER TABLE' to change a column specification but `DESCRIBE
tbl_name' indicates that your column was not changed, it is possible
that MySQL ignored your modification for one of the reasons described
in *Note Silent column changes::.  For example, if you try to change a
`VARCHAR' column to `CHAR', MySQL will still use `VARCHAR' if the table
contains other variable-length columns.

`ALTER TABLE' works by making a temporary copy of the original table.
The alteration is performed on the copy, then the original table is
deleted and the new one is renamed. This is done in such a way that all
updates are automatically redirected to the new table without any
failed updates. While `ALTER TABLE' is executing, the original table is
readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table are stalled
until the new table is ready.

Note that if you use any other option to `ALTER TABLE' than `RENAME',
MySQL will always create a temporary table, even if the data wouldn't
strictly need to be copied (like when you change the name of a column).
We plan to fix this in the future, but as one doesn't normally do
`ALTER TABLE' that often this isn't that high on our TODO.

   * To use `ALTER TABLE', you need *ALTER*, *INSERT*, and *CREATE*
     privileges on the table.

   * `IGNORE' is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.  It controls how
     `ALTER TABLE' works if there are duplicates on unique keys in the
     new table.  If `IGNORE' isn't specified, the copy is aborted and
     rolled back.  If `IGNORE' is specified, then for rows with
     duplicates on a unique key, only the first row is used; the others
     are deleted.

   * You can issue multiple `ADD', `ALTER', `DROP', and `CHANGE'
     clauses in a single `ALTER TABLE' statement. This is a MySQL
     extension to ANSI SQL92, which allows only one of each clause per
     `ALTER TABLE' statement.

   * `CHANGE col_name', `DROP col_name', and `DROP INDEX' are MySQL
     extensions to ANSI SQL92.

   * `MODIFY' is an Oracle extension to `ALTER TABLE'.

   * The optional word `COLUMN' is a pure noise word and can be omitted.

   * If you use `ALTER TABLE tbl_name RENAME TO new_name' without any
     other options, MySQL simply renames the files that correspond to
     the table `tbl_name'.  There is no need to create the temporary
     table.  *Note `RENAME TABLE': RENAME TABLE.

   * `create_definition' clauses use the same syntax for `ADD' and
     `CHANGE' as for `CREATE TABLE'.  Note that this syntax includes
     the column name, not just the column type.  *Note `CREATE TABLE':
     CREATE TABLE.

   * You can rename a column using a `CHANGE old_col_name
     create_definition' clause.  To do so, specify the old and new
     column names and the type that the column currently has.  For
     example, to rename an `INTEGER' column from `a' to `b', you can do
     this:

          mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b INTEGER;

     If you want to change a column's type but not the name, `CHANGE'
     syntax still requires two column names even if they are the same.
     For example:

          mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b BIGINT NOT NULL;

     However, as of MySQL Version 3.22.16a, you can also use `MODIFY'
     to change a column's type without renaming it:

          mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b BIGINT NOT NULL;

   * If you use `CHANGE' or `MODIFY' to shorten a column for which an
     index exists on part of the column (for instance, if you have an
     index on the first 10 characters of a `VARCHAR' column), you
     cannot make the column shorter than the number of characters that
     are indexed.

   * When you change a column type using `CHANGE' or `MODIFY', MySQL
     tries to convert data to the new type as well as possible.

   * In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use `FIRST' or `ADD ...
     AFTER col_name' to add a column at a specific position within a
     table row. The default is to add the column last.

   * `ALTER COLUMN' specifies a new default value for a column or
     removes the old default value.  If the old default is removed and
     the column can be `NULL', the new default is `NULL'. If the column
     cannot be `NULL', MySQL assigns a default value, as described in
     *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

   * `DROP INDEX' removes an index. This is a MySQL extension to ANSI
     SQL92. *Note DROP INDEX::.

   * If columns are dropped from a table, the columns are also removed
     from any index of which they are a part.  If all columns that make
     up an index are dropped, the index is dropped as well.

   * If a table contains only one column, the column cannot be dropped.
     If what you intend is to remove the table, use `DROP TABLE'
     instead.

   * `DROP PRIMARY KEY' drops the primary index. If no such index
     exists, it drops the first `UNIQUE' index in the table.  (MySQL
     marks the first `UNIQUE' key as the `PRIMARY KEY' if no `PRIMARY
     KEY' was specified explicitly.)

     If you add a `UNIQUE INDEX' or `PRIMARY KEY' to a table, this is
     stored before any not `UNIQUE' index so that MySQL can detect
     duplicate keys as early as possible.

   * `ORDER BY' allows you to create the new table with the rows in a
     specific order.  Note that the table will not remain in this order
     after inserts and deletes.  In some cases, it may make sorting
     easier for MySQL if the table is in order by the column that you
     wish to order it by later.  This option is mainly useful when you
     know that you are mostly going to query the rows in a certain
     order; By using this option after big changes to the table, you
     may be able to get higher performance.

   * If you use `ALTER TABLE' on a `MyISAM' table, all non-unique
     indexes are created in a separate batch (like in `REPAIR').  This
     should make `ALTER TABLE' much faster when you have many indexes.

   * With the C API function `mysql_info()', you can find out how many
     records were copied, and (when `IGNORE' is used) how many records
     were deleted due to duplication of unique key values.

   * The `FOREIGN KEY', `CHECK', and `REFERENCES' clauses don't
     actually do anything.  The syntax for them is provided only for
     compatibility, to make it easier to port code from other SQL
     servers and to run applications that create tables with references.
     *Note Missing functions::.

Here is an example that shows some of the uses of `ALTER TABLE'.  We
begin with a table `t1' that is created as shown below:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a INTEGER,b CHAR(10));

To rename the table from `t1' to `t2':

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME t2;

To change column `a' from `INTEGER' to `TINYINT NOT NULL' (leaving the
name the same), and to change column `b' from `CHAR(10)' to `CHAR(20)'
as well as renaming it from `b' to `c':

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 MODIFY a TINYINT NOT NULL, CHANGE b c CHAR(20);

To add a new `TIMESTAMP' column named `d':

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD d TIMESTAMP;

To add an index on column `d', and make column `a' the primary key:

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD INDEX (d), ADD PRIMARY KEY (a);

To remove column `c':

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c;

To add a new `AUTO_INCREMENT' integer column named `c':

     mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                ADD INDEX (c);

Note that we indexed `c', because `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns must be
indexed, and also that we declare `c' as `NOT NULL', because indexed
columns cannot be `NULL'.

When you add an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column, column values are filled in
with sequence numbers for you automatically.  You can set the first
sequence number by executing `SET INSERT_ID=#' before `ALTER TABLE' or
using the `AUTO_INCREMENT = #' table option.  *Note SET OPTION::.

With MyISAM tables, if you don't change the `AUTO_INCREMENT' column,
the sequence number will not be affected. If you drop an
`AUTO_INCREMENT' column and then add another `AUTO_INCREMENT' column,
the numbers will start from 1 again.

*Note ALTER TABLE problems::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: RENAME TABLE,  Next: DROP TABLE,  Prev: ALTER TABLE,  Up: Data Definition

`RENAME TABLE' Syntax
---------------------

     RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_table_name[, tbl_name2 TO new_table_name2,...]

The rename is done atomically, which means that no other thread can
access any of the tables while the rename is running. This makes it
possible to replace a table with an empty one:

     CREATE TABLE new_table (...);
     RENAME TABLE old_table TO backup_table, new_table TO old_table;

The rename is done from left to right, which means that if you want to
swap two tables names, you have to:

     RENAME TABLE old_table    TO backup_table,
                  new_table    TO old_table,
                  backup_table TO new_table;

As long as two databases are on the same disk you can also rename from
one database to another:

     RENAME TABLE current_database.table_name TO other_database.table_name;

When you execute `RENAME', you can't have any locked tables or active
transactions.  You must also have the `ALTER' and `DROP' privilege on
the original table and `CREATE' and `INSERT' privilege on the new table.

If MySQL encounters any errors in a multiple table rename, it will do a
reverse rename for all renamed tables to get everything back to the
original state.

`DROP TABLE' Syntax
-------------------

     DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name [, tbl_name,...] [RESTRICT | CASCADE]

`DROP TABLE' removes one or more tables. All table data and the table
definition are _removed_, so *be careful* with this command!

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use the keywords `IF EXISTS' to
prevent an error from occurring for tables that don't exist.

`RESTRICT' and `CASCADE' are allowed to make porting easier.  For the
moment they don't do anything.

*NOTE*: `DROP TABLE' is not transaction-safe and will automatically
commit any active transactions.


File: mysql.info,  Node: CREATE INDEX,  Next: DROP INDEX,  Prev: DROP TABLE,  Up: Data Definition

`CREATE INDEX' Syntax
---------------------

     CREATE [UNIQUE|FULLTEXT] INDEX index_name ON tbl_name (col_name[(length)],... )

The `CREATE INDEX' statement doesn't do anything in MySQL prior to
Version 3.22.  In Version 3.22 or later, `CREATE INDEX' is mapped to an
`ALTER TABLE' statement to create indexes.  *Note `ALTER TABLE': ALTER
TABLE.

Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself
is created with `CREATE TABLE'.  *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.
`CREATE INDEX' allows you to add indexes to existing tables.

A column list of the form `(col1,col2,...)' creates a multiple-column
index.  Index values are formed by concatenating the values of the given
columns.

For `CHAR' and `VARCHAR' columns, indexes can be created that use only
part of a column, using `col_name(length)' syntax.  (On `BLOB' and
`TEXT' columns the length is required). The statement shown below
creates an index using the first 10 characters of the `name' column:

     mysql> CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));

Because most names usually differ in the first 10 characters, this
index should not be much slower than an index created from the entire
`name' column.  Also, using partial columns for indexes can make the
index file much smaller, which could save a lot of disk space and might
also speed up `INSERT' operations!

Note that you can only add an index on a column that can have `NULL'
values or on a `BLOB'/`TEXT' column if you are using MySQL Version
3.23.2 or newer and are using the `MyISAM' table type.

For more information about how MySQL uses indexes, see *Note MySQL
indexes: MySQL indexes.

`FULLTEXT' indexes can index only `VARCHAR' and `TEXT' columns, and
only in `MyISAM' tables. `FULLTEXT' indexes are available in MySQL
Version 3.23.23 and later.  *Note Fulltext Search::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: DROP INDEX,  Prev: CREATE INDEX,  Up: Data Definition

`DROP INDEX' Syntax

     DROP INDEX index_name ON tbl_name

`DROP INDEX' drops the index named `index_name' from the table
`tbl_name'.  `DROP INDEX' doesn't do anything in MySQL prior to Version
3.22.  In Version 3.22 or later, `DROP INDEX' is mapped to an `ALTER
TABLE' statement to drop the index.  *Note `ALTER TABLE': ALTER TABLE.

`USE' Syntax
------------

     USE db_name

The `USE db_name' statement tells MySQL to use the `db_name' database
as the default database for subsequent queries.  The database remains
current until the end of the session or until another `USE' statement
is issued:

     mysql> USE db1;
     mysql> SELECT count(*) FROM mytable;      # selects from db1.mytable
     mysql> USE db2;
     mysql> SELECT count(*) FROM mytable;      # selects from db2.mytable

Making a particular database current by means of the `USE' statement
does not preclude you from accessing tables in other databases.  The
example below accesses the `author' table from the `db1' database and
the `editor' table from the `db2' database:

     mysql> USE db1;
     mysql> SELECT author_name,editor_name FROM author,db2.editor
                WHERE author.editor_id = db2.editor.editor_id;

`DESCRIBE' provides information about a table's columns.  `col_name'
may be a column name or a string containing the SQL `%' and `_'
wild-card characters.

If the column types are different than you expect them to be based on a

File: mysql.info,  Node: COMMIT,  Next: LOCK TABLES,  Prev: Transactional Commands,  Up: Transactional Commands

`BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK' Syntax
------------------------------

By default, MySQL runs in `autocommit' mode. This means that as soon as
you execute an update, MySQL will store the update on disk.

If you are using transactions safe tables (like `BDB', `InnoDB', you
can put MySQL into non-`autocommit' mode with the following command:

     SET AUTOCOMMIT=0

After this you must use `COMMIT' to store your changes to disk or
`ROLLBACK' if you want to ignore the changes you have made since the
beginning of your transaction.

If you want to switch from `AUTOCOMMIT' mode for one series of
statements, you can use the `BEGIN' or `BEGIN WORK' statement:

     BEGIN;
     SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
     UPDATE table2 SET summmary=@A WHERE type=1;
     COMMIT;

Note that if you are using non-transaction-safe tables, the changes
will be stored at once, independent of the status of the `autocommit'
mode.

If you do a `ROLLBACK' when you have updated a non-transactional table
you will get an error (`ER_WARNING_NOT_COMPLETE_ROLLBACK') as a
warning.  All transactional safe tables will be restored but any
non-transactional table will not change.

If you are using `BEGIN' or `SET AUTOCOMMIT=0', you should use the
MySQL binary log for backups instead of the older update log.
Transactions are stored in the binary log in one chunk, upon `COMMIT',
to ensure that transactions which are rolled back are not stored.
*Note Binary log::.

The following commands automatically end a transaction (as if you had
done a `COMMIT' before executing the command):

`ALTER TABLE'            `BEGIN'                  `CREATE INDEX'
`DROP DATABASE'          `DROP TABLE'             `RENAME TABLE'
`TRUNCATE'                                        

You can change the isolation level for transactions with `SET
TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...'. *Note SET TRANSACTION::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: LOCK TABLES,  Next: SET TRANSACTION,  Prev: COMMIT,  Up: Transactional Commands

`LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES' Syntax
----------------------------------

     LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ | [READ LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE}
                 [, tbl_name {READ | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE} ...]
     ...
     UNLOCK TABLES

`LOCK TABLES' locks tables for the current thread.  `UNLOCK TABLES'
releases any locks held by the current thread.  All tables that are
locked by the current thread are automatically unlocked when the thread
issues another `LOCK TABLES', or when the connection to the server is
closed.

The main reasons to use `LOCK TABLES' are for emulating transactions or
getting more speed when updating tables.  This is explained in more
detail later.

If a thread obtains a `READ' lock on a table, that thread (and all other
threads) can only read from the table. If a thread obtains a `WRITE'
lock on a table, then only the thread holding the lock can `READ' from
or `WRITE' to the table.  Other threads are blocked.

The difference between `READ LOCAL' and `READ' is that `READ LOCAL'
allows non-conflicting `INSERT' statements to execute while the lock is
held.  This can't however be used if you are going to manipulate the
database files outside MySQL while you hold the lock.

When you use `LOCK TABLES', you must lock all tables that you are going
to use and you must use the same alias that you are going to use in
your queries!  If you are using a table multiple times in a query (with
aliases), you must get a lock for each alias!

`WRITE' locks normally have higher priority than `READ' locks, to
ensure that updates are processed as soon as possible. This means that
if one thread obtains a `READ' lock and then another thread requests a
`WRITE' lock, subsequent `READ' lock requests will wait until the
`WRITE' thread has gotten the lock and released it.  You can use
`LOW_PRIORITY WRITE' locks to allow other threads to obtain `READ'
locks while the thread is waiting for the `WRITE' lock. You should only
use `LOW_PRIORITY WRITE' locks if you are sure that there will
eventually be a time when no threads will have a `READ' lock.

`LOCK TABLES' works as follows:
  1. Sort all tables to be locked in a internally defined order (from
     the user standpoint the order is undefined).

  2. If a table is locked with a read and a write lock, put the write
     lock before the read lock.

  3. Lock one table at a time until the thread gets all locks.

This policy ensures that table locking is deadlock free. There is
however other things one needs to be aware of with this schema:

If you are using a `LOW_PRIORITY_WRITE' lock for a table, this means
only that MySQL will wait for this particlar lock until there is no
threads that wants a `READ' lock.  When the thread has got the `WRITE'
lock and is waiting to get the lock for the next table in the lock
table list, all other threads will wait for the `WRITE' lock to be
released.  If this becomes a serious problem with your application, you
should consider converting some of your tables to transactions safe
tables.

You can safely kill a thread that is waiting for a table lock with
`KILL'.  *Note KILL::.

Note that you should *NOT* lock any tables that you are using with
`INSERT DELAYED'.  This is because that in this case the `INSERT' is
done by a separate thread.

Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single `UPDATE'
statements are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any other
currently executing SQL statement. There are a few cases when you would
like to lock tables anyway:

   * If you are going to run many operations on a bunch of tables, it's
     much faster to lock the tables you are going to use.  The downside
     is, of course, that no other thread can update a `READ'-locked
     table and no other thread can read a `WRITE'-locked table.

     The reason some things are faster under `LOCK TABLES' is that
     MySQL will not flush the key cache for the locked tables until
     `UNLOCK TABLES' is called (normally the key cache is flushed after
     each SQL statement). This speeds up inserting/updateing/deletes on
     `MyISAM' tables.

   * If you are using a table handler in MySQL that doesn't support
     transactions, you must use `LOCK TABLES' if you want to ensure that
     no other thread comes between a `SELECT' and an `UPDATE'. The
     example shown below requires `LOCK TABLES' in order to execute
     safely:

          mysql> LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
          mysql> select sum(value) from trans where customer_id= some_id;
          mysql> update customer set total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
                     where customer_id=some_id;
          mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;

     Without `LOCK TABLES', there is a chance that another thread might
     insert a new row in the `trans' table between execution of the
     `SELECT' and `UPDATE' statements.

By using incremental updates (`UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value') or the `LAST_INSERT_ID()' function, you can
avoid using `LOCK TABLES' in many cases.

You can also solve some cases by using the user-level lock functions
`GET_LOCK()' and `RELEASE_LOCK()'.  These locks are saved in a hash
table in the server and implemented with `pthread_mutex_lock()' and
`pthread_mutex_unlock()' for high speed.  *Note Miscellaneous
functions::.

See *Note Internal locking::, for more information on locking policy.

You can lock all tables in all databases with read locks with the
`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK' command. *Note FLUSH::. This is very
convenient way to get backups if you have a file system, like Veritas,
that can take snapshots in time.

*NOTE*: `LOCK TABLES' is not transaction-safe and will automatically
commit any active transactions before attempting to lock the tables.

`SET TRANSACTION' Syntax
------------------------

     SET [GLOBAL | SESSION] TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
     [READ UNCOMMITTED | READ COMMITTED | REPEATABLE READ | SERIALIZABLE]

Sets the transaction isolation level for the global, whole session or
the next transaction.

The default behavior is to set the isolation level for the next (not
started) transaction.

If you set the `GLOBAL' privilege it will affect all new created
threads.  You will need the `PROCESS' privilege to do do this.

Setting the `SESSION' privilege will affect the following and all
future transactions.

You can set the default isolation level for `mysqld' with
`--transaction-isolation=...'. *Note Command-line options::.

MySQL Full-text Search
======================

Since Version 3.23.23, MySQL has support for full-text indexing and
searching.  Full-text indexes in MySQL are an index of type `FULLTEXT'.
`FULLTEXT' indexes can be created from `VARCHAR' and `TEXT' columns at
`CREATE TABLE' time or added later with `ALTER TABLE' or `CREATE
INDEX'.  For large datasets, adding `FULLTEXT' index with `ALTER TABLE'
(or `CREATE INDEX') would be much faster than inserting rows into the
empty table with a `FULLTEXT' index.

Full-text search is performed with the `MATCH' function.

     mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
         ->   id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
         ->   title VARCHAR(200),
         ->   body TEXT,
         ->   FULLTEXT (title,body)
         -> );
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     mysql> INSERT INTO articles VALUES
         -> (0,'MySQL Tutorial', 'DBMS stands for DataBase Management ...'),
         -> (0,'How To Use MySQL Efficiently', 'After you went through a ...'),
         -> (0,'Optimizing MySQL','In this tutorial we will show how to ...'),
         -> (0,'1001 MySQL Trick','1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. Normalize ...'),
         -> (0,'MySQL vs. YourSQL', 'In the following database comparison we ...'),
         -> (0,'MySQL Security', 'When configured properly, MySQL could be ...');
     Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
     
     mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('database');
     +----+-------------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | id | title             | body                                        |

     |  1 | MySQL Tutorial    | DBMS stands for DataBase Management ...     |
     +----+-------------------+---------------------------------------------+
     2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

The function `MATCH' matches a natural language query `AGAINST' a text
collection (which is simply the set of columns covered by a `FULLTEXT'
index).  For every row in a table it returns relevance - a similarity
measure between the text in that row (in the columns that are part of
the collection) and the query.  When it is used in a `WHERE' clause
(see example above) the rows returned are automatically sorted with
relevance decreasing.  Relevance is a non-negative floating-point
number.  Zero relevance means no similarity.  Relevance is computed
based on the number of words in the row, the number of unique words in
that row, the total number of words in the collection, and the number
of documents (rows) that contain a particular word.

The above is a basic example of using `MATCH' function. Rows are
returned with relevance decreasing.

     mysql> SELECT id,MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('Tutorial') FROM articles;
     +----+-----------------------------------------+
     | id | MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('Tutorial') |
     +----+-----------------------------------------+
     |  1 |                        0.64840710366884 |
     |  2 |                                       0 |
     |  3 |                        0.66266459031789 |
     |  4 |                                       0 |
     |  5 |                                       0 |
     |  6 |                                       0 |
     +----+-----------------------------------------+
     5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

This example shows how to retrieve the relevances. As neither `WHERE'
nor `ORDER BY' clauses are present, returned rows are not ordered.

     mysql> SELECT id, body, MATCH (title,body) AGAINST (
         -> 'Security implications of running MySQL as root') AS score
         -> FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST
         -> ('Security implications of running MySQL as root');
     +----+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+
     | id | body                                          | score           |
     +----+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+
     |  4 | 1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. Normalize ... | 1.5055546709332 |
     |  6 | When configured properly, MySQL could be ...  |   1.31140957288 |
     +----+-----------------------------------------------+-----------------+
     2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

This is more complex example - the query returns the relevance and still
sorts the rows with relevance decreasing. To achieve it one should
specify `MATCH' twice. Note, that this will cause no additional
overhead, as MySQL optimizer will notice that these two `MATCH' calls
are identical and will call full-text search code only once.

MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A "word" is
any sequence of letters, numbers, `'', and `_'.  Any "word" that is
present in the stopword list or just too short (3 characters or less)
is ignored.

Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted,
according to its significance in the query or collection.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents will have lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Otherwise, if the word is rare, it will receive
a higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute
the relevance of the row.

Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not reflect adequately their semantical value, and this model may
sometimes produce bizarre results.

     mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
     Empty set (0.00 sec)

Search for the word `MySQL' produces no results in the above example.
Word `MySQL' is present in more than half of rows, and as such, is
effectively treated as a stopword (that is, with semantical value zero).
It is, really, the desired behavior - a natural language query should
not return every second row in 1GB table.

A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate
relevant documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of
irrelevant documents.  We all know this happens far too often when we
are trying to find something on the Internet with a search engine.  It
is with this reasoning that such rows have been assigned a low
semantical value in *this particular dataset*.

Fine-tuning MySQL Full-text Search
----------------------------------

Unfortunately, full-text search has no user-tunable parameters yet,
although adding some is very high on the TODO.  However, if you have a
MySQL source distribution (*Note Installing source::.), you can
somewhat alter the full-text search behavior.

Note that full-text search was carefully tuned for the best searching
effectiveness.  Modifying the default behavior will, in most cases,
only make the search results worse.  Do not alter the MySQL sources
unless you know what you are doing!

   * Minimal length of word to be indexed is defined in
     `myisam/ftdefs.h' file by the line
          #define MIN_WORD_LEN 4
     Change it to the value you prefer, recompile MySQL, and rebuild
     your `FULLTEXT' indexes.

   * The stopword list is defined in `myisam/ft_static.c' Modify it to
     your taste, recompile MySQL and rebuild your `FULLTEXT' indexes.

   * The 50% threshold is caused by the particular weighting scheme
     chosen. To disable it, change the following line in
     `myisam/ftdefs.h':
          #define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
     to
          #define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
     and recompile MySQL.  There is no need to rebuild the indexes in
     this case.

   * `REPAIR TABLE' with `FULLTEXT' indexes, `ALTER TABLE' with
     `FULLTEXT' indexes, and `OPTIMIZE TABLE' with `FULLTEXT' indexes
     are now up to 100 times faster.

   * `MATCH ... AGAINST' is going to supports the following *boolean
     operators*:

        * `+'word means the that word *must* be present in every row
          returned.

        * `-'word means the that word *must not* be present in every
          row returned.

        * `<' and `>' can be used to decrease and increase word weight
          in the query.

        * `~' can be used to assign a *negative* weight to a noise word.

        * `*' is a truncation operator.

     Boolean search utilizes a more simplistic way of calculating the
     relevance, that does not have a 50% threshold.

   * Searches are now up to 2 times faster due to optimized search

MySQL Table Types
*****************

As of MySQL Version 3.23.6, you can choose between three basic table
formats (`ISAM', `HEAP' and `MyISAM'.  Newer MySQL may support
additional table type (`BDB', or `InnoDB'), depending on how you
compile it.

When you create a new table, you can tell MySQL which table type it
should use for the table.  MySQL will always create a `.frm' file to
hold the table and column definitions.  Depending on the table type,
the index and data will be stored in other files.

Note that to use `InnoDB' tables you have to use at least the
`innodb_data_file_path' startup option. *Note InnoDB start::.

The default table type in MySQL is `MyISAM'. If you are trying to use a
table type that is not compiled-in or activated, MySQL will instead
create a table of type `MyISAM'.  This is a very useful feature when
you want to copy tables between different SQL servers that supports
different table types (like copying tables to a slave that is optimized
for speed by not having transactional tables).  This automatic table
changing can however also be very confusing for new MySQL users. We
plan to fix this by introducing warnings in MySQL 4.0 and giving a
warning when a table type is automatically changed.

You can convert tables between different types with the `ALTER TABLE'
statement. *Note `ALTER TABLE': ALTER TABLE.

Note that MySQL supports two different kinds of tables.
Transaction-safe tables (`BDB', `InnoDB' and not transaction-safe
tables (`HEAP', `ISAM', `MERGE', and `MyISAM').

Advantages of transaction-safe tables (TST):

   * Safer. Even if MySQL crashes or you get hardware problems, you can
     get your data back, either by automatic recovery or from a backup
     + the transaction log.

   * You can combine many statements and accept these all in one go with
     the `COMMIT' command.

   * You can execute `ROLLBACK' to ignore your changes (if you are not
     running in auto commit mode).

   * If an update fails, all your changes will be restored. (With NTST
     tables all changes that have taken place are permanent)

Advantages of not transaction-safe tables (NTST):

   * Much faster as there is no transaction overhead.

   * Will use less disk space as there is no overhead of transactions.

   * Will use less memory to do updates.

You can combine TST and NTST tables in the same statements to get the
best of both worlds.

MyISAM Tables
=============

`MyISAM' is the default table type in MySQL Version 3.23. It's based on
the `ISAM' code and has a lot of useful extensions.

The index is stored in a file with the `.MYI' (MYIndex) extension, and
the data is stored in a file with the `.MYD' (MYData) extension.  You
can check/repair `MyISAM' tables with the `myisamchk' utility. *Note
Crash recovery::. You can compress `MyISAM' tables with `myisampack' to
take up much less space. *Note myisampack::.

The following is new in `MyISAM':

   * There is a flag in the `MyISAM' file that indicates whether or not
     the table was closed correctly.  If `mysqld' is started with
     `--myisam-recover', `MyISAM' tables will automatically be checked
     and/or repaired on open if the table wasn't closed properly.

   * You can `INSERT' new rows in a table that doesn't have free blocks
     in the middle of the data file, at the same time other threads are
     reading from the table (concurrent insert).  An free block can
     come from an update of a dynamic length row with much data to a
     row with less data or when deleting rows. When all free blocks are
     used up, all future inserts will be concurrent again.

   * Support for big files (63-bit) on filesystems/operating systems
     that support big files.

   * All data is stored with the low byte first. This makes the data
     machine and OS independent. The only requirement is that the
     machine uses two's-complement signed integers (as every machine
     for the last 20 years has) and IEEE floating-point format (also
     totally dominant among mainstream machines). The only area of
     machines that may not support binary compatibility are embedded
     systems (because they sometimes have peculiar processors).

     There is no big speed penalty in storing data low byte first; The
     bytes in a table row is normally unaligned and it doesn't take
     that much more power to read an unaligned byte in order than in
     reverse order.  The actual fetch-column-value code is also not
     time critical compared to other code.

   * All number keys are stored with high byte first to give better
     index compression.

   * Internal handling of one `AUTO_INCREMENT' column. `MyISAM' will
     automatically update this on `INSERT/UPDATE'. The `AUTO_INCREMENT'
     value can be reset with `myisamchk'. This will make
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns faster (at least 10 %) and old numbers
     will not be reused as with the old `ISAM'. Note that when an
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' is defined on the end of a multi-part-key the old
     behavior is still present.

   * When inserted in sorted order (as when you are using an
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' column) the key tree will be split so that the
     high node only contains one key. This will improve the space
     utilization in the key tree.

   * `BLOB' and `TEXT' columns can be indexed.

   * `NULL' values are allowed in indexed columns.  This takes 0-1
     bytes/key.

   * Maximum key length is 500 bytes by default (can be changed by
     recompiling).  In cases of keys longer than 250 bytes, a bigger key
     block size than the default of 1024 bytes is used for this key.

   * Maximum number of keys/table is 32 as default. This can be
     enlarged to 64 without having to recompile `myisamchk'.

   * `myisamchk' will mark tables as checked if one runs it with
     `--update-state'. `myisamchk --fast' will only check those tables
     that don't have this mark.

   * `myisamchk -a' stores statistics for key parts (and not only for
     whole keys as in `ISAM').

   * Dynamic size rows will now be much less fragmented when mixing
     deletes with updates and inserts.  This is done by automatically
     combining adjacent deleted blocks and by extending blocks if the
     next block is deleted.

   * `myisampack' can pack `BLOB' and `VARCHAR' columns.

   * You can use put the datafile and index file on different
     directories to get more speed (with the `DATA/INDEX
     DIRECTORY="path"' option to `CREATE TABLE'). *Note CREATE TABLE::.

`MyISAM' also supports the following things, which MySQL will be able
to use in the near future:

   * Support for a true `VARCHAR' type; A `VARCHAR' column starts with
     a length stored in 2 bytes.

   * Tables with `VARCHAR' may have fixed or dynamic record length.

   * `VARCHAR' and `CHAR' may be up to 64K.  All key segments have
     their own language definition. This will enable MySQL to have
     different language definitions per column.

   * A hashed computed index can be used for `UNIQUE'. This will allow
     you to have `UNIQUE' on any combination of columns in a table. (You
     can't search on a `UNIQUE' computed index, however.)

Note that index files are usually much smaller with `MyISAM' than with
`ISAM'. This means that `MyISAM' will normally use less system
resources than `ISAM', but will need more CPU when inserting data into
a compressed index.

The following options to `mysqld' can be used to change the behavior of
`MyISAM' tables. *Note SHOW VARIABLES::.

*Option*                      *Meaning*

                              paramter is given in megabytes!

The automatic recovery is activated if you start `mysqld' with
`--myisam-recover=#'. *Note Command-line options::.  On open, the table
is checked if it's marked as crashed or if the open count variable for
the table is not 0 and you are running with `--skip-locking'.  If
either of the above is true the following happens.

   * The table is checked for errors.

   * If we found an error, try to do a fast repair (with sorting and
     without re-creating the data file) of the table.

   * If the repair fails because of an error in the data file (for
     example a duplicate key error), we try again, but this time we
     re-create the data file.

   * If the repair fails, retry once more with the old repair option
     method (write row by row without sorting) which should be able to
     repair any type of error with little disk requirements..

If the recover wouldn't be able to recover all rows from a previous
completed statement and you didn't specify `FORCE' as an option to
`myisam-recover', then the automatic repair will abort with an error
message in the error file:

     Error: Couldn't repair table: test.g00pages

If you in this case had used the `FORCE' option you would instead have
got a warning in the error file:

     Warning: Found 344 of 354 rows when repairing ./test/g00pages

Note that if you run automatic recover with the `BACKUP' option, you
should have a cron script that automatically moves file with names like
`tablename-datetime.BAK' from the database directories to a backup
media.

Space Needed for Keys
---------------------

MySQL can support different index types, but the normal type is ISAM or
MyISAM.  These use a B-tree index, and you can roughly calculate the
size for the index file as `(key_length+4)/0.67', summed over all keys.
(This is for the worst case when all keys are inserted in sorted order
and we don't have any compressed keys.)

String indexes are space compressed. If the first index part is a
string, it will also be prefix compressed.  Space compression makes the
index file smaller than the above figures if the string column has a lot
of trailing space or is a `VARCHAR' column that is not always used to
the full length. Prefix compression is used on keys that start with a
string.  Prefix compression helps if there are many strings with an
identical prefix.

In `MyISAM' tables, you can also prefix compress numbers by specifying
`PACK_KEYS=1' when you create the table.  This helps when you have many
integer keys that have an identical prefix when the numbers are stored
high-byte first.

MyISAM Table Formats
--------------------

*MyISAM* supports 3 different table types. Two of them are chosen
automatically depending on the type of columns you are using. The third,
compressed tables, can only be created with the `myisampack' tool.

Static (Fixed-length) Table Characteristics
...........................................

This is the default format. It's used when the table contains no
`VARCHAR', `BLOB', or `TEXT' columns.

This format is the simplest and most secure format. It is also the
fastest of the on-disk formats. The speed comes from the easy way data
can be found on disk. When looking up something with an index and static
format it is very simple. Just multiply the row number by the row
length.

Also, when scanning a table it is very easy to read a constant number of
records with each disk read.

The security is evidenced if your computer crashes when writing to a
fixed-size MyISAM file, in which case `myisamchk' can easily figure out
where each row starts and ends. So it can usually reclaim all records
except the partially written one. Note that in MySQL all indexes can
always be reconstructed:

   * All `CHAR', `NUMERIC', and `DECIMAL' columns are space-padded to
     the column width.

   * Very quick.

   * Easy to cache.

   * Easy to reconstruct after a crash, because records are located in
     fixed positions.

   * Doesn't have to be reorganized (with `myisamchk') unless a huge
     number of records are deleted and you want to return free disk
     space to the operating system.

   * Usually requires more disk space than dynamic tables.

Dynamic Table Characteristics
.............................

This format is used if the table contains any `VARCHAR', `BLOB', or
`TEXT' columns or if the table was created with `ROW_FORMAT=dynamic'.

This format is a little more complex because each row has to have a
header that says how long it is. One record can also end up at more
than one location when it is made longer at an update.

You can use `OPTIMIZE table' or `myisamchk' to defragment a table. If
you have static data that you access/change a lot in the same table as
some `VARCHAR' or `BLOB' columns, it might be a good idea to move the
dynamic columns to other tables just to avoid fragmentation:

   * All string columns are dynamic (except those with a length less
     than 4).

   * Each record is preceded by a bitmap indicating which columns are
     empty (`''') for string columns, or zero for numeric columns.
     (This isn't the same as columns containing `NULL' values.) If a
     string column has a length of zero after removal of trailing
     spaces, or a numeric column has a value of zero, it is marked in
     the bit map and not saved to disk.  Non-empty strings are saved as
     a length byte plus the string contents.

   * Usually takes much less disk space than fixed-length tables.

   * Each record uses only as much space as is required. If a record
     becomes larger, it is split into as many pieces as are required.
     This results in record fragmentation.

   * If you update a row with information that extends the row length,
     the row will be fragmented.  In this case, you may have to run
     `myisamchk -r' from time to time to get better performance.  Use
     `myisamchk -ei tbl_name' for some statistics.

   * Not as easy to reconstruct after a crash, because a record may be
     fragmented into many pieces and a link (fragment) may be missing.

   * The expected row length for dynamic sized records is:

          3
          + (number of columns + 7) / 8
          + (number of char columns)
          + packed size of numeric columns
          + length of strings
          + (number of NULL columns + 7) / 8

     There is a penalty of 6 bytes for each link. A dynamic record is
     linked whenever an update causes an enlargement of the record.
     Each new link will be at least 20 bytes, so the next enlargement
     will probably go in the same link.  If not, there will be another
     link. You may check how many links there are with `myisamchk -ed'.
     All links may be removed with `myisamchk -r'.

Compressed Table Characteristics
................................

This is a read-only type that is generated with the optional
`myisampack' tool (`pack_isam' for `ISAM' tables):

   * All MySQL distributions, even those that existed before MySQL went
     GPL, can read tables that were compressed with `myisampack'.

   * Compressed tables take very little disk space. This minimizes disk
     usage, which is very nice when using slow disks (like CD-ROMs).

   * Each record is compressed separately (very little access
     overhead).  The header for a record is fixed (1-3 bytes) depending
     on the biggest record in the table.  Each column is compressed
     differently. Some of the compression types are:
        - There is usually a different Huffman table for each column.

        - Suffix space compression.

        - Prefix space compression.

        - Numbers with value `0' are stored using 1 bit.

        - If values in an integer column have a small range, the column
          is stored using the smallest possible type. For example, a
          `BIGINT' column (8 bytes) may be stored as a `TINYINT' column
          (1 byte) if all values are in the range `0' to `255'.

        - If a column has only a small set of possible values, the
          column type is converted to `ENUM'.

        - A column may use a combination of the above compressions.

   * Can handle fixed- or dynamic-length records, but not `BLOB' or
     `TEXT' columns.

   * Can be uncompressed with `myisamchk'.

MyISAM table problems.
----------------------

The file format that MySQL uses to store data has been extensively
tested, but there are always circumstances that may cause database
tables to become corrupted.

* Menu:

* Corrupted MyISAM tables::     Corrupted MyISAM tables.
* MyISAM table close::          Clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly

Corrupted MyISAM tables.
........................

Even if the MyISAM table format is very reliable (all changes to a table
is written before the SQL statements returns) , you can still get
corrupted tables if some of the following things happens:

   * The `mysqld' process being killed in the middle of a write.

   * Unexpected shutdown of the computer (for example, if the computer
     is turned off).

   * A hardware error.

   * You are using an external program (like myisamchk) on a live table.

   * A software bug in the MySQL or MyISAM code.

Typial typical symptoms for a corrupt table is:

   * You get the error `Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to
     repair it' while selecting data from the table.

   * Queries doesn't find rows in the table or returns incomplete data.

You can check if a table is ok with the command `CHECK TABLE'. *Note
CHECK TABLE::.

You can repair a corrupted table with `REPAIR TABLE'. *Note REPAIR
TABLE::.  You can also repair a table, when `mysqld' is not running with
the `myisamchk' command. `myisamchk syntax'.

If your tables get corrupted a lot you should try to find the reason for
this! *Note Crashing::.

In this case the most important thing to know is if the table got
corrupted if the `mysqld' died (one can easily verify this by checking
if there is a recent row `restarted mysqld' in the mysqld error file).
If this isn't the case, then you should try to make a test case of
this.  *Note Reproduceable test case::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: MyISAM table close,  Prev: Corrupted MyISAM tables,  Up: MyISAM table problems

Clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
....................................................

Each `MyISAM' `.MYI' file has in the header a counter that can be used
to check if a table has been closed properly.

If you get the following warning from `CHECK TABLE' or `myisamchk':

     # clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly

this means that this counter has come out of sync.  This doesn't mean
that the table is corrupted, but means that you should at least do a
check on the table to verify that it's ok.

The counter works as follows:

   * The first time a table is updated in MySQL, a counter in the
     header of the index files is incremented.

   * The counter is not changed during further updates.

   * When the last instance of a table is closed (because of a `FLUSH'
     or because there isn't room in the table cache) the counter is
     decremented if the table has been updated at any point.

   * When you repair the table or check the table and it was ok, the
     counter is reset to 0.

   * To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that may
     do a check on the table, the counter is not decremented on close
     if it was 0.

In other words, the only ways this can go out of sync are:

   * The `MyISAM' tables are copied without a `LOCK' and `FLUSH TABLES'.

   * MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close (Note that
     the table may still be ok, as MySQL always issues writes for
     everything between each statement).

   * Someone has done a `myisamchk --repair' or `myisamchk
     --update-state'on a table that was in use by `mysqld'.

   * Many `mysqld' servers are using the table and one has done a
     `REPAIR' or `CHECK' of the table while it was in use by another
     server.  In this setup the `CHECK' is safe to do (even if you will
     get the warning from other servers), but `REPAIR' should be
     avoided as it currently replaces the data file with a new one,
     which is not signaled to the other servers.


File: mysql.info,  Node: MERGE,  Next: ISAM,  Prev: MyISAM,  Up: Table types

MERGE Tables
============

`MERGE' tables are new in MySQL Version 3.23.25. The code is still in
gamma, but should be resonable stable.

A `MERGE' table is a collection of identical `MyISAM' tables that can
be used as one.  You can only `SELECT', `DELETE', and `UPDATE' from the
collection of tables.  If you `DROP' the `MERGE' table, you are only
dropping the `MERGE' specification.

Note that `DELETE FROM merge_table' used without a `WHERE' will only
clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the mapped
tables. (We plan to fix this in 4.0).

With identical tables we mean that all tables are created with identical
column and key information.  You can't put a MERGE over tables where the
columns are packed differently, doesn't have exactly the same columns or
have the keys in different order.  Some of the tables can however be
compressed with `myisampack'.  *Note myisampack::.

When you create a `MERGE' table, you will get a `.frm' table definition
file and a `.MRG' table list file.  The `.MRG' just contains a list of
the index files (`.MYI' files) that should be used as one.  All used
tables must be in the same database as the `MERGE' table itself.

For the moment you need to have `SELECT', `UPDATE', and `DELETE'
privileges on the tables you map to a `MERGE' table.

`MERGE' tables can help you solve the following problems:

   * Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put data
     from different months into separate files, compress some of them
     with `myisampack', and then create a `MERGE' to use these as one.

   * Give you more speed. You can split a big read-only table based on
     some criteria and then put the different table part on different
     disks.  A `MERGE' table on this could be much faster than using
     the big table. (You can, of course, also use a RAID to get the same
     kind of benefits.)

   * Do more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you are
     looking after, you can search in just one of the split tables for
     some queries and use *MERGE* table for others.  You can even have
     many different `MERGE' tables active, with possible overlapping
     files.

   * More efficient repairs. It's easier to repair the individual files
     that are mapped to a `MERGE' file than trying to repair a real big
     file.

   * Instant mapping of many files as one. A `MERGE' table uses the
     index of the individual tables. It doesn't need to maintain an
     index of its one.  This makes `MERGE' table collections VERY fast
     to make or remap.  Note that you must specify the key definitions
     when you create a `MERGE' table!.

   * If you have a set of tables that you join to a big table on demand
     or batch, you should instead create a `MERGE' table on them on
     demand.  This is much faster and will save a lot of disk space.

   * Go around the file size limit for the operating system.

   * You can create an alias/synonym for a table by just using MERGE
     over one table. There shouldn't be any really notable performance
     impacts of doing this (only a couple of indirect calls and
     memcpy's for each read).

The disadvantages with `MERGE' tables are:

   * You can't use `INSERT' on `MERGE' tables, as MySQL can't know in
     which of the tables we should insert the row.

   * You can only use identical `MyISAM' tables for a `MERGE' table.

   * `MERGE' tables uses more file descriptors. If you are using a
     *MERGE* that maps over 10 tables and 10 users are using this, you
     are using 10*10 + 10 file descriptors.  (10 data files for 10 users
     and 10 shared index files.)

   * Key reads are slower. When you do a read on a key, the `MERGE'
     handler will need to issue a read on all underlying tables to check
     which one most closely matches the given key.  If you then do a
     'read-next' then the merge table handler will need to search the
     read buffers to find the next key. Only when one key buffer is
     used up, the handler will need to read the next key block. This
     makes `MERGE' keys much slower on `eq_ref' searches, but not much
     slower on `ref' searches.  *Note EXPLAIN::.

   * You can't do `DROP TABLE', `ALTER TABLE' or `DELETE FROM
     table_name' without a `WHERE' clause on any of the table that is
     mapped by a `MERGE' table that is 'open'.  If you do this, the
     `MERGE' table may still refer to the original table and you will
     get unexpected results.

The following example shows you how to use `MERGE' tables:

     CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
     CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
     INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t1");
     INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t2");
     CREATE TABLE total (a INT NOT NULL, message CHAR(20), KEY(a)) TYPE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2);

Note that we didn't create a `UNIQUE' or `PRIMARY KEY' in the `total'
table as the key isn't going to be unique in the `total' table.

Note that you can also manipulate the `.MRG' file directly from the
outside of the MySQL server:

     shell> cd /mysql-data-directory/current-database
     shell> ls -1 t1.MYI t2.MYI > total.MRG
     shell> mysqladmin flush-tables

Now you can do things like:

     mysql> select * from total;
     +---+---------+
     | a | message |
     +---+---------+
     | 1 | Testing |
     | 2 | table   |
     | 3 | t1      |
     | 1 | Testing |
     | 2 | table   |
     | 3 | t2      |
     +---+---------+

To remap a `MERGE' table you can do one of the following:

   * `DROP' the table and re-create it

   * Use `ALTER TABLE table_name UNION(...)'

   * Change the `.MRG' file and issue a `FLUSH TABLE' on the `MERGE'
     table and all underlying tables to force the handler to read the
     new definition file.

ISAM Tables
===========

You can also use the deprecated ISAM table type. This will disappear
rather soon because `MyISAM' is a better implementation of the same
thing. ISAM uses a `B-tree' index. The index is stored in a file with
the `.ISM' extension, and the data is stored in a file with the `.ISD'
extension.  You can check/repair ISAM tables with the `isamchk'
utility. *Note Crash recovery::.

`ISAM' has the following features/properties:

   * Compressed and fixed-length keys

   * Fixed and dynamic record length

   * 16 keys with 16 key parts/key

   * Max key length 256 (default)

   * Data is stored in machine format; this is fast, but is machine/OS
     dependent.

Most of the things true for `MyISAM' tables are also true for `ISAM'
tables. *Note MyISAM::. The major differences compared to `MyISAM'
tables are:

   * ISAM tables are not binary portable across OS/Platforms.

   * Can't handle tables > 4G.

   * Only support prefix compression on strings.

   * Smaller key limits.

   * Dynamic tables get more fragmented.

   * Tables are compressed with `pack_isam' rather than with
     `myisampack'.

If you want to convert an `ISAM' table to a `MyISAM' table so that you
can use utilities such as `mysqlcheck', use an `ALTER TABLE' statement:

     mysql> ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE = MYISAM;


File: mysql.info,  Node: HEAP,  Next: BDB,  Prev: ISAM,  Up: Table types

HEAP Tables
===========

`HEAP' tables use a hashed index and are stored in memory.  This makes
them very fast, but if MySQL crashes you will lose all data stored in
them.  `HEAP' is very useful for temporary tables!

The MySQL internal HEAP tables use 100% dynamic hashing without
overflow areas. There is no extra space needed for free lists.  `HEAP'
tables also don't have problems with delete + inserts, which normally
is common with hashed tables:

     mysql> CREATE TABLE test TYPE=HEAP SELECT ip,SUM(downloads) as down
             FROM log_table GROUP BY ip;
     mysql> SELECT COUNT(ip),AVG(down) FROM test;
     mysql> DROP TABLE test;

Here are some things you should consider when you use `HEAP' tables:

   * You should always use specify `MAX_ROWS' in the `CREATE' statement
     to ensure that you accidentally do not use all memory.

   * Indexes will only be used with `=' and `<=>' (but are VERY fast).

   * `HEAP' tables can only use whole keys to search for a row; compare
     this to `MyISAM' tables where any prefix of the key can be used to
     find rows.

   * `HEAP' tables use a fixed record length format.

   * `HEAP' doesn't support `BLOB'/`TEXT' columns.

   * `HEAP' doesn't support `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns.

   * `HEAP' doesn't support an index on a `NULL' column.

   * You can have non-unique keys in a `HEAP' table (this isn't common
     for hashed tables).

   * `HEAP' tables are shared between all clients (just like any other
     table).

   * You can't search for the next entry in order (that is, to use the
     index to do an `ORDER BY').

   * Data for `HEAP' tables are allocated in small blocks. The tables
     are 100% dynamic (on inserting). No overflow areas and no extra key
     space are needed.  Deleted rows are put in a linked list and are
     reused when you insert new data into the table.

   * You need enough extra memory for all HEAP tables that you want to
     use at the same time.

   * To free memory, you should execute `DELETE FROM heap_table',
     `TRUNCATE heap_table' or `DROP TABLE heap_table'.

   * MySQL cannot find out approximately how many rows there are
     between two values (this is used by the range optimizer to decide
     which index to use).  This may affect some queries if you change a
     `MyISAM' table to a `HEAP' table.

   * To ensure that you accidentally don't do anything foolish, you
     can't create `HEAP' tables bigger than `max_heap_table_size'.

The memory needed for one row in a `HEAP' table is:

     SUM_OVER_ALL_KEYS(max_length_of_key + sizeof(char*) * 2)
     + ALIGN(length_of_row+1, sizeof(char*))

`sizeof(char*)' is 4 on 32-bit machines and 8 on 64-bit machines.

Overview of BDB Tables
----------------------

Support for BDB tables is included in the MySQL source distribution
starting from Version 3.23.34 and is activated in the MySQL-Max binary.

BerkeleyDB, available at `http://www.sleepycat.com/' has provided MySQL
with a transactional table handler.  By using BerkeleyDB tables, your
tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes, and also
provides `COMMIT' and `ROLLBACK' on transactions.  The MySQL source
distribution comes with a BDB distribution that has a couple of small
patches to make it work more smoothly with MySQL.  You can't use a
non-patched `BDB' version with MySQL.

We at MySQL AB are working in close cooperation with Sleepycat to keep
the quality of the MySQL/BDB interface high.

When it comes to supporting BDB tables, we are committed to help our
users to locate the problem and help creating a reproducable test case
for any problems involving BDB tables.  Any such test case will be
forwarded to Sleepycat who in turn will help us find and fix the
problem.  As this is a two stage operation, any problems with BDB tables
may take a little longer for us to fix than for other table handlers.
However, as the BerkeleyDB code itself has been used by many other
applications than MySQL, we don't envision any big problems with this.
*Note Table handler support::.

Installing BDB
--------------

If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes support
for BerkeleyDB, simply follow the instructions for installing a binary
version of MySQL.  *Note Installing binary::.  *Note `mysqld-max':
mysqld-max.

To compile MySQL with Berkeley DB support, download MySQL Version
3.23.34 or newer and configure `MySQL' with the `--with-berkeley-db'
option.  *Note Installing source::.

     cd /path/to/source/of/mysql-3.23.34
     ./configure --with-berkeley-db

Please refer to the manual provided with the `BDB' distribution for
more updated information.

Even though Berkeley DB is in itself very tested and reliable, the
MySQL interface is still considered beta quality.  We are actively
improving and optimizing it to get it stable very soon.


File: mysql.info,  Node: BDB start,  Next: BDB characteristic,  Prev: BDB install,  Up: BDB

BDB startup options
-------------------

If you are running with `AUTOCOMMIT=0' then your changes in `BDB'
tables will not be updated until you execute `COMMIT'.  Instead of
commit you can execute `ROLLBACK' to forget your changes. *Note
COMMIT::.

If you are running with `AUTOCOMMIT=1' (the default), your changes will
be committed immediately.  You can start an extended transaction with
the `BEGIN WORK' SQL command, after which your changes will not be
committed until you execute `COMMIT' (or decide to `ROLLBACK' the
changes).

The following options to `mysqld' can be used to change the behavior of
BDB tables:

*Option*               *Meaning*
`--bdb-home=directory' Base directory for BDB tables. This should be the
                       same directory you use for -datadir.
`--bdb-lock-detect=#'  Berkeley lock detect. One of (DEFAULT, OLDEST,
                       RANDOM, or YOUNGEST).
`--bdb-logdir=directory'Berkeley DB log file directory.
`--bdb-no-sync'        Don't synchronously flush logs.
`--bdb-no-recover'     Don't start Berkeley DB in recover mode.
`--bdb-shared-data'    Start Berkeley DB in multi-process mode (Don't
                       use `DB_PRIVATE' when initializing Berkeley DB)
`--bdb-tmpdir=directory'Berkeley DB tempfile name.
`--skip-bdb'           Don't use berkeley db.
`-O                    Set the maximum number of locks possible. *Note
bdb_max_lock=1000'     SHOW VARIABLES::.

If you use `--skip-bdb', MySQL will not initialize the Berkeley DB
library and this will save a lot of memory. Of course, you cannot use
`BDB' tables if you are using this option.

Normally you should start `mysqld' without `--bdb-no-recover' if you
intend to use BDB tables.  This may, however, give you problems when you
try to start `mysqld' if the BDB log files are corrupted. *Note
Starting server::.

With `bdb_max_lock' you can specify the maximum number of locks (10000
by default) you can have active on a BDB table. You should increase
this if you get errors of type `bdb: Lock table is out of available
locks' or `Got error 12 from ...'  when you have do long transactions
or when `mysqld' has to examine a lot of rows to calculate the query.

You may also want to change `binlog_cache_size' and
`max_binlog_cache_size' if you are using big multi-line transactions.
*Note COMMIT::.

Some characteristic of `BDB' tables:
------------------------------------

   * To be able to rollback transactions BDB maintain log files.  For
     maximum performance you should place these on another disk than
     your databases by using the `--bdb_log_dir' options.

   * MySQL performs a checkpoint each time a new BDB log file is
     started, and removes any log files that are not needed for current
     transactions.  One can also run `FLUSH LOGS' at any time to
     checkpoint the Berkeley DB tables.

     For disaster recovery, one should use table backups plus MySQL's
     binary log. *Note Backup::.

     *Warning*: If you delete old log files that are in use, BDB will
     not be able to do recovery at all and you may lose data if
     something goes wrong.

   * MySQL requires a `PRIMARY KEY' in each BDB table to be able to
     refer to previously read rows. If you don't create one, MySQL will
     create an maintain a hidden `PRIMARY KEY' for you.  The hidden key
     has a length of 5 bytes and is incremented for each insert attempt.

   * If all columns you access in a `BDB' table are part of the same
     index or part of the primary key, then MySQL can execute the query
     without having to access the actual row.  In a `MyISAM' table the
     above holds only if the columns are part of the same index.

   * The `PRIMARY KEY' will be faster than any other key, as the
     `PRIMARY KEY' is stored together with the row data.  As the other
     keys are stored as the key data + the `PRIMARY KEY', it's
     important to keep the `PRIMARY KEY' as short as possible to save
     disk and get better speed.

   * `LOCK TABLES' works on `BDB' tables as with other tables.  If you
     don't use `LOCK TABLE', MYSQL will issue an internal
     multiple-write lock on the table to ensure that the table will be
     properly locked if another thread issues a table lock.

   * Internal locking in `BDB' tables is done on page level.

   * `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name' is slow as `BDB' tables doesn't
     maintain a count of the number of rows in the table.

   * Scanning is slower than with `MyISAM' tables as one has data in BDB
     tables stored in B-trees and not in a separate data file.

   * The application must always be prepared to handle cases where any
     change of a `BDB' table may make an automatic rollback and any
     read may fail with a deadlock error.

   * Keys are not compressed to previous keys as with ISAM or MyISAM
     tables. In other words, the key information will take a little more
     space in `BDB' tables compared to MyISAM tables which don't use
     `PACK_KEYS=0'.

   * There is often holes in the BDB table to allow you to insert new
     rows in the middle of the key tree.  This makes BDB tables
     somewhat larger than MyISAM tables.

   * The optimizer needs to know an approximation of the number of rows
     in the table.  MySQL solves this by counting inserts and
     maintaining this in a separate segment in each BDB table.  If you
     don't do a lot of `DELETE' or `ROLLBACK':s this number should be
     accurate enough for the MySQL optimizer, but as MySQL only store
     the number on close, it may be wrong if MySQL dies unexpectedly.
     It should not be fatal even if this number is not 100 % correct.
     One can update the number of rows by executing `ANALYZE TABLE' or
     `OPTIMIZE TABLE'. *Note ANALYZE TABLE:: . *Note OPTIMIZE TABLE::.

   * If you get full disk with a `BDB' table, you will get an error
     (probably error 28) and the transaction should roll back.  This is
     in contrast with `MyISAM' and `ISAM' tables where `mysqld' will
     wait for enough free disk before continuing.

Some things we need to fix for BDB in the near future:
------------------------------------------------------

   * It's very slow to open many BDB tables at the same time. If you are
     going to use BDB tables, you should not have a very big table
     cache (> 256 ?) and you should use `--no-auto-rehash' with the
     `mysql' client.  We plan to partly fix this in 4.0.

   * `SHOW TABLE STATUS' doesn't yet provide that much information for
     BDB tables.

   * Optimize performance.

   * Change to not use page locks at all when we are scanning tables.

Operating systems supported by *BDB*
------------------------------------

If you after having built MySQL with support for BDB tables get the
following error in the log file when you start `mysqld':

     bdb: architecture lacks fast mutexes: applications cannot be threaded
     Can't init dtabases

This means that `BDB' tables are not supported for your architecture.
In this case you have to rebuild MySQL without BDB table support.

NOTE: The following list is not complete; We will update this as we get
more information about this.

Currently we know that BDB tables works with the following operating
system.

   * Linux 2.x intel

   * Solaris sparc

   * SCO OpenServer

   * SCO UnixWare 7.0.1

It doesn't work with the following operating systems:

   * Linux 2.x Alpha

   * Max OS X


File: mysql.info,  Node: BDB errors,  Prev: BDB portability,  Up: BDB

Errors You May Get When Using BDB Tables
----------------------------------------

   * If you get the following error in the `hostname.err log' when
     starting `mysqld':

          bdb:  Ignoring log file: .../log.XXXXXXXXXX: unsupported log version #
     it means that the new `BDB' version doesn't support the old log
     file format.  In this case you have to delete all `BDB' log BDB
     from your database directory (the files that has the format
     `log.XXXXXXXXXX' ) and restart `mysqld'.  We would also recommend
     you to do a `mysqldump --opt' of your old `BDB' tables, delete the
     old table and restore the dump.

   * If you are running in not `auto_commit' mode and delete a table you
     are using by another thread you may get the following error
     messages in the MySQL error file:

          001119 23:43:56  bdb:  Missing log fileid entry
          001119 23:43:56  bdb:  txn_abort: Log undo failed for LSN: 1 3644744: Invalid

     This is not fatal but we don't recommend that you delete tables if
     you are not in `auto_commit' mode, until this problem is fixed
     (the fix is not trivial).

InnoDB tables overview
----------------------

InnoDB tables are included in the MySQL source distribution starting
from 3.23.34a and are activated in the *MySQL -max* binary.

If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes support
for InnoDB (mysqld-max), simply follow the instructions for installing
a binary version of MySQL. *Note Installing binary::.  *Note
`mysqld-max': mysqld-max.

To compile MySQL with InnoDB support, download MySQL-3.23.37 or newer
and configure MySQL with the `--with-innodb' option.  *Note Installing
source::.

     cd /path/to/source/of/mysql-3.23.37
     ./configure --with-innodb

To get InnoDB to work you have to specify where the data for InnoDB
tables should be stored by specifying the `innodb_data_file_path'
option on the command line or in an MySQL option file. *Note InnoDB
start::.  If you have configured MySQL for InnoDB but you have not
specified the above option, `mysqld' will print at start:

     Can't initialize InnoDB as 'innodb_data_file_path' is not set

InnoDB provides MySQL with a transaction-safe table handler with
commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities. InnoDB does locking
on row level, and also provides an Oracle-style consistent non-locking
read in `SELECTS', which increases transaction concurrency. There is
not need for lock escalation in InnoDB, because row level locks in
InnoDB fit in very small space.

InnoDB has been designed for maximum performance when processing large
data volumes. Its CPU efficiency is probably not matched by any other
disk-based relational database engine.

You can find the latest information about InnoDB at
`http://www.innodb.com'. The most up-to-date version of the InnoDB
manual is always placed there, and you can also order commercial
support for InnoDB.

Technically, InnoDB is a database backend placed under MySQL. InnoDB
has its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main memory.
InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which may consist
of several files. This is different from, for example, `MyISAM' tables
where each table is stored as a separate file.

InnoDB is distributed under the GNU GPL License Version 2 (of June
1991).  In the source distribution of MySQL, InnoDB appears as a
subdirectory.

InnoDB startup options
----------------------

Beginning from MySQL-3.23.37 the prefix of the options is changed from
`innobase_...' to `innodb_...'.

To use InnoDB tables you *MUST* specify configuration parameters in the
MySQL configuration file in the `[mysqld]' section of the configuration
file `my.cnf'. *Note Option files::.

The only required parameter to use InnoDB is `innodb_data_file_path',
but you should set others if you want to get a better performance.

Suppose you have a Windows NT machine with 128 MB RAM and a single 10 GB
hard disk.  Below is an example of possible configuration parameters in
`my.cnf' for InnoDB:

     innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:2000M;ibdata2:2000M
     innodb_data_home_dir = c:\ibdata
     set-variable = innodb_mirrored_log_groups=1
     innodb_log_group_home_dir = c:\iblogs
     set-variable = innodb_log_files_in_group=3
     set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=30M
     set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
     innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
     innodb_log_arch_dir = c:\iblogs
     innodb_log_archive=0
     set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=80M
     set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=10M
     set-variable = innodb_file_io_threads=4
     set-variable = innodb_lock_wait_timeout=50

Note that data files must be < 4G, and < 2G on some file systems! The
total size of data files has to be >= 10 MB.  InnoDB does not create
directories: you have to create them yourself.

Suppose you have a Linux machine with 512 MB RAM and three 20 GB hard
disks (at directory paths `/', `/dr2' and `/dr3').  Below is an example
of possible configuration parameters in `my.cnf' for InnoDB:

     innodb_data_file_path = ibdata/ibdata1:2000M;dr2/ibdata/ibdata2:2000M
     innodb_data_home_dir = /
     set-variable = innodb_mirrored_log_groups=1
     innodb_log_group_home_dir = /dr3
     set-variable = innodb_log_files_in_group=3
     set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=50M
     set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
     innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
     innodb_log_arch_dir = /dr3/iblogs
     innodb_log_archive=0
     set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=400M
     set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=20M
     set-variable = innodb_file_io_threads=4
     set-variable = innodb_lock_wait_timeout=50

Note that we have placed the two data files on different disks.  The
reason for the name `innodb_data_file_path' is that you can also
specify paths to your data files, and `innodb_data_home_dir' is just
textually catenated before your data file paths, adding a possible
slash or backslash in between. InnoDB will fill the tablespace formed
by the data files from bottom up. In some cases it will improve the
performance of the database if all data is not placed on the same
physical disk. Putting log files on a different disk from data is very
often beneficial for performance.

The meanings of the configuration parameters are the following:

`innodb_data_home_dir'  The common part of the directory path for all
                       InnoDB data files.
`innodb_data_file_path' Paths to individual data files and their sizes.
                       The full directory path to each data file is
                       acquired by concatenating innodb_data_home_dir to
                       the paths specified here. The file sizes are
                       specified in megabytes, hence the 'M' after the
                       size specification above. Do not set a file size
                       bigger than 4000M, and on most operating systems
                       not bigger than 2000M.  InnoDB also understands
                       the abbreviation 'G', 1G meaning 1024M.  The sum
                       of the sizes of the files must be at least 10 MB.
`innodb_mirrored_log_groups' Number of identical copies of log groups we keep
                       for the database. Currently this should be set to
                       1.
`innodb_log_group_home_dir' Directory path to InnoDB log files.
`innodb_log_files_in_group' Number of log files in the log group. InnoDB
                       writes to the files in a circular fashion. Value
                       3 is recommended here.
`innodb_log_file_size'  Size of each log file in a log group in
                       megabytes. Sensible values range from 1M to the
                       size of the buffer pool specified below. The
                       bigger the value, the less checkpoint flush
                       activity is needed in the buffer pool, saving
                       disk i/o. But bigger log files also mean that
                       recovery will be slower in case of a crash. File
                       size restriction as for a data file.
`innodb_log_buffer_size' The size of the buffer which InnoDB uses to
                       write log to the log files on disk.  Sensible
                       values range from 1M to half the combined size of
                       log files. A big log buffer allows large
                       transactions to run without a need to write the
                       log to disk until the transaction commit. Thus,
                       if you have big transactions, making the log
                       buffer big will save disk i/o.
`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit' Normally this is set to 1, meaning that at a
                       transaction commit the log is flushed to disk,
                       and the modifications made by the transaction
                       become permanent, and survive a database crash.
                       If you are willing to compromise this safety, and
                       you are running small transactions, you may set
                       this to 0 to reduce disk i/o to the logs.
`innodb_log_arch_dir'   The directory where fully written log files
                       would be archived if we used log archiving.  The
                       value of this parameter should currently be set
                       the same as `innodb_log_group_home_dir'.
`innodb_log_archive'    This value should currently be set to 0.  As
                       recovery from a backup is done by MySQL using its
                       own log files, there is currently no need to
                       archive InnoDB log files.
`innodb_buffer_pool_size' The size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to
                       cache data and indexes of its tables.  The bigger
                       you set this the less disk i/o is needed to
                       access data in tables. On a dedicated database
                       server you may set this parameter up to 90 % of
                       the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
                       too large, though, because competition of the
                       physical memory may cause paging in the operating
                       system.
`innodb_additional_mem_pool_size' Size of a memory pool InnoDB uses to store data
                       dictionary information and other internal data
                       structures. A sensible value for this might be
                       2M, but the more tables you have in your
                       application the more you will need to allocate
                       here. If InnoDB runs out of memory in this pool,
                       it will start to allocate memory from the
                       operating system, and write warning messages to
                       the MySQL error log.
`innodb_file_io_threads' Number of file i/o threads in InnoDB. Normally,
                       this should be 4, but on Windows NT disk i/o may
                       benefit from a larger number.
`innodb_lock_wait_timeout' Timeout in seconds an InnoDB transaction may
                       wait for a lock before being rolled back.  InnoDB
                       automatically detects transaction deadlocks in
                       its own lock table and rolls back the
                       transaction. If you use `LOCK TABLES' command, or
                       other transaction-safe table handlers than InnoDB
                       in the same transaction, then a deadlock may
                       arise which InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like
                       this the timeout is useful to resolve the
                       situation.
`innodb_flush_method'   (Available from 3.23.40 up.)  The default value
                       for this is `fdatasync'.  Another option is
                       `O_DSYNC'.

Creating InnoDB table space
---------------------------

Suppose you have installed MySQL and have edited `my.cnf' so that it
contains the necessary InnoDB configuration parameters.  Before
starting MySQL you should check that the directories you have specified
for InnoDB data files and log files exist and that you have access
rights to those directories. InnoDB cannot create directories, only
files. Check also you have enough disk space for the data and log files.

When you now start MySQL, InnoDB will start creating your data files
and log files. InnoDB will print something like the following:

     ~/mysqlm/sql > mysqld
     InnoDB: The first specified data file /home/heikki/data/ibdata1 did not exist:
     InnoDB: a new database to be created!
     InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata1 size to 134217728
     InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
     InnoDB: Data file /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 did not exist: new to be created
     InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 size to 262144000
     InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
     InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 did not exist: new to be c
     reated
     InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 size to 5242880
     InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 did not exist: new to be c
     reated
     InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 size to 5242880
     InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 did not exist: new to be c
     reated
     InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 size to 5242880
     InnoDB: Started
     mysqld: ready for connections

A new InnoDB database has now been created. You can connect to the MySQL
server with the usual MySQL client programs like `mysql'.  When you
shut down the MySQL server with `mysqladmin shutdown', InnoDB output
will be like the following:

     010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Normal shutdown
     010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Shutdown Complete
     InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
     InnoDB: Shutdown completed

You can now look at the data files and logs directories and you will
see the files created. The log directory will also contain a small file
named `ib_arch_log_0000000000'. That file resulted from the database
creation, after which InnoDB switched off log archiving.  When MySQL is
again started, the output will be like the following:

     ~/mysqlm/sql > mysqld
     InnoDB: Started
     mysqld: ready for connections

If something goes wrong in database creation
............................................

If something goes wrong in an InnoDB database creation, you should
delete all files created by InnoDB. This means all data files, all log
files, the small archived log file, and in the case you already did
create some InnoDB tables, delete also the corresponding `.frm' files
for these tables from the MySQL database directories. Then you can try
the InnoDB database creation again.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Using InnoDB tables,  Next: Adding and removing,  Prev: InnoDB init,  Up: InnoDB

Creating InnoDB tables
----------------------

Suppose you have started the MySQL client with the command `mysql test'.
To create a table in the InnoDB format you must specify `TYPE = InnoDB'
in the table creation SQL command:

     CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (A INT, B CHAR (20), INDEX (A)) TYPE = InnoDB;

This SQL command will create a table and an index on column `A' into
the InnoDB tablespace consisting of the data files you specified in
`my.cnf'. In addition MySQL will create a file `CUSTOMER.frm' to the
MySQL database directory `test'.  Internally, InnoDB will add to its
own data dictionary an entry for table `'test/CUSTOMER''. Thus you can
create a table of the same name `CUSTOMER' in another database of
MySQL, and the table names will not collide inside InnoDB.

You can query the amount of free space in the InnoDB tablespace by
issuing the table status command of MySQL for any table you have
created with `TYPE = InnoDB'. Then the amount of free space in the
tablespace appears in the table comment section in the output of
`SHOW'. An example:

     SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM test LIKE 'CUSTOMER'

Note that the statistics `SHOW' gives about InnoDB tables are only
approximate: they are used in SQL optimization. Table and index
reserved sizes in bytes are accurate, though.

NOTE: `DROP DATABASE' does not currently work for InnoDB tables!  You
must drop the tables individually. Also take care not to delete or add
`.frm' files to your InnoDB database manually: use `CREATE TABLE' and
`DROP TABLE' commands.  InnoDB has its own internal data dictionary,
and you will get problems if the MySQL `.frm' files are out of 'sync'
with the InnoDB internal data dictionary.

Converting MyISAM tables to InnoDB
..................................

InnoDB does not have a special optimization for separate index creation.
Therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create
indexes afterwards.  The fastest way to alter a table to InnoDB is to
do the inserts directly to an InnoDB table, that is, use `ALTER TABLE
... TYPE=INNODB', or create an empty InnoDB table with identical
definitions and insert the rows with `INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM
...'.

To get better control over the insertion process, it may be good to
insert big tables in pieces:

     INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable WHERE yourkey > something
                                                  AND yourkey <= somethingelse;

After all data has been inserted you can rename the tables.

During the conversion of big tables you should set the InnoDB buffer
pool size big to reduce disk i/o. Not bigger than 80 % of the physical
memory, though.  You should set InnoDB log files big, and also the log
buffer large.

Make sure you do not run out of tablespace: InnoDB tables take a lot
more space than MyISAM tables. If an `ALTER TABLE' runs out of space,
it will start a rollback, and that can take hours if it is disk-bound.
In inserts InnoDB uses the insert buffer to merge secondary index
records to indexes in batches. That saves a lot of disk i/o. In
rollback no such mechanism is used, and the rollback can take 30 times
longer than the insertion.

In the case of a runaway rollback, if you do not have valuable data in
your database, it is better that you kill the database process and
delete all InnoDB data and log files and all InnoDB table `.frm' files,
and start your job again, rather than wait for millions of disk i/os to
complete.

Adding and removing InnoDB data and log files
---------------------------------------------

You cannot increase the size of an InnoDB data file. To add more into
your tablespace you have to add a new data file. To do this you have to
shut down your MySQL database, edit the `my.cnf' file, adding a new
file to `innodb_data_file_path', and then start MySQL again.

Currently you cannot remove a data file from InnoDB. To decrease the
size of your database you have to use `mysqldump' to dump all your
tables, create a new database, and import your tables to the new
database.

If you want to change the number or the size of your InnoDB log files,
you have to shut down MySQL and make sure that it shuts down without
errors.  Then copy the old log files into a safe place just in case
something went wrong in the shutdown and you will need them to recover
the database. Delete then the old log files from the log file directory,
edit `my.cnf', and start MySQL again. InnoDB will tell you at the
startup that it is creating new log files.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Backing up,  Next: Moving,  Prev: Adding and removing,  Up: InnoDB

Backing up and recovering an InnoDB database
--------------------------------------------

The key to safe database management is taking regular backups.  To take
a 'binary' backup of your database you have to do the following:

   * Shut down your MySQL database and make sure it shuts down without
     errors.

   * Copy all your data files into a safe place.

   * Copy all your InnoDB log files to a safe place.

   * Copy your `my.cnf' configuration file(s) to a safe place.

   * Copy all the `.frm' files for your InnoDB tables into a safe place.

There is currently no on-line or incremental backup tool available for
InnoDB, though they are in the TODO list.

In addition to taking the binary backups described above, you should
also regularly take dumps of your tables with `mysqldump'. The reason
to this is that a binary file may be corrupted without you noticing it.
Dumped tables are stored into text files which are human-readable and
much simpler than database binary files. Seeing table corruption from
dumped files is easier, and since their format is simpler, the chance
for serious data corruption in them is smaller.

A good idea is to take the dumps at the same time you take a binary
backup of your database. You have to shut out all clients from your
database to get a consistent snapshot of all your tables into your
dumps. Then you can take the binary backup, and you will then have a
consistent snapshot of your database in two formats.

To be able to recover your InnoDB database to the present from the
binary backup described above, you have to run your MySQL database with
the general logging and log archiving of MySQL switched on. Here by the
general logging we mean the logging mechanism of the MySQL server which
is independent of InnoDB logs.

To recover from a crash of your MySQL server process, the only thing
you have to do is to restart it. InnoDB will automatically check the
logs and perform a roll-forward of the database to the present.  InnoDB
will automatically roll back uncommitted transactions which were
present at the time of the crash. During recovery, InnoDB will print
out something like the following:

     ~/mysqlm/sql > mysqld
     InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.
     InnoDB: Starting recovery from log files...
     InnoDB: Starting log scan based on checkpoint at

     InnoDB: Rollback of uncommitted transactions completed
     InnoDB: Starting an apply batch of log records to the database...
     InnoDB: Apply batch completed
     InnoDB: Started
     mysqld: ready for connections

If your database gets corrupted or your disk fails, you have to do the
recovery from a backup. In the case of corruption, you should first
find a backup which is not corrupted. From a backup do the recovery
from the general log files of MySQL according to instructions in the
MySQL manual.

* InnoDB checkpoints::          Checkpoints


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB checkpoints,  Prev: Backing up,  Up: Backing up

Checkpoints
...........

InnoDB implements a checkpoint mechanism called a fuzzy checkpoint.
InnoDB will flush modified database pages from the buffer pool in small
batches, there is no need to flush the buffer pool in one single batch,
which would in practice stop processing of user SQL statements for a
while.

In crash recovery InnoDB looks for a checkpoint label written to the
log files. It knows that all modifications to the database before the
label are already present on the disk image of the database.  Then
InnoDB scans the log files forward from the place of the checkpoint
applying the logged modifications to the database.

InnoDB writes to the log files in a circular fashion.  All committed
modifications which make the database pages in the buffer pool
different from the images on disk must be available in the log files in
case InnoDB has to do a recovery. This means that when InnoDB starts to
reuse a log file in the circular fashion, it has to make sure that the
database page images on disk already contain the modifications logged
in the log file InnoDB is going to reuse. In other words, InnoDB has to
make a checkpoint and often this involves flushing of modified database
pages to disk.

The above explains why making your log files very big may save disk i/o
in checkpointing. It can make sense to set the total size of the log
files as big as the buffer pool or even bigger.  The drawback in big
log files is that crash recovery can last longer because there will be
more log to apply to the database.

Moving an InnoDB database to another machine
--------------------------------------------

InnoDB data and log files are binary-compatible on all platforms if the
floating point number format on the machines is the same.  You can move
an InnoDB database simply by copying all the relevant files, which we
already listed in the previous section on backing up a database. If the
floating point formats on the machines are different but you have not
used `FLOAT' or `DOUBLE' data types in your tables then the procedure
is the same: just copy the relevant files. If the formats are different
and your tables contain floating point data, you have to use `mysqldump'
and `mysqlimport' to move those tables.

A performance tip is to switch off the auto commit when you import data
into your database, assuming your tablespace has enough space for the
big rollback segment the big import transaction will generate.  Do the
commit only after importing a whole table or a segment of a table.

InnoDB transaction model
------------------------

In the InnoDB transaction model the goal has been to combine the best
sides of a multiversioning database to traditional two-phase locking.
InnoDB does locking on row level and runs queries by default as
non-locking consistent reads, in the style of Oracle.  The lock table
in InnoDB is stored so space-efficiently that lock escalation is not
needed: typically several users are allowed to lock every row in the
database, or any random subset of the rows, without InnoDB running out
of memory.

In InnoDB all user activity happens inside transactions. If the auto
commit mode is used in MySQL, then each SQL statement will form a
single transaction. If the auto commit mode is switched off, then we
can think that a user always has a transaction open. If he issues the
SQL `COMMIT' or `ROLLBACK' statement, that ends the current
transaction, and a new starts. Both statements will release all InnoDB
locks that were set during the current transaction. A `COMMIT' means
that the changes made in the current transaction are made permanent and
become visible to other users. A `ROLLBACK' on the other hand cancels
all modifications made by the current transaction.

File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB consistent read,  Next: InnoDB locking reads,  Prev: InnoDB transaction model,  Up: InnoDB transaction model

Consistent read
...............

A consistent read means that InnoDB uses its multiversioning to present
to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time.  The query
will see the changes made by exactly those transactions that committed
before that point of time, and no changes made by later or uncommitted
transactions. The exception to this rule is that the query will see the
changes made by the transaction itself which issues the query.

When a transaction issues its first consistent read, InnoDB assigns the
snapshot, or the point of time, which all consistent reads in the same
transaction will use. In the snapshot are all transactions that
committed before assigning the snapshot. Thus the consistent reads
within the same transaction will also be consistent with respect to each
other. You can get a fresher snapshot for your queries by committing
the current transaction and after that issuing new queries.

Consistent read is the default mode in which InnoDB processes `SELECT'
statements. A consistent read does not set any locks on the tables it
accesses, and therefore other users are free to modify those tables at
the same time a consistent read is being performed on the table.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB locking reads,  Next: InnoDB Next-key locking,  Prev: InnoDB consistent read,  Up: InnoDB transaction model

Locking reads
.............

A consistent read is not convenient in some circumstances.  Suppose you
want to add a new row into your table `CHILD', and make sure that the
child already has a parent in table `PARENT'.

Suppose you use a consistent read to read the table `PARENT' and indeed
see the parent of the child in the table. Can you now safely add the
child row to table `CHILD'? No, because it may happen that meanwhile
some other user has deleted the parent row from the table `PARENT', and
you are not aware of that.

The solution is to perform the `SELECT' in a locking mode, `LOCK IN
SHARE MODE'.

     SELECT * FROM PARENT WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;

Performing a read in share mode means that we read the latest available
data, and set a shared mode lock on the rows we read.  If the latest
data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another user, we will
wait until that transaction commits.  A shared mode lock prevents
others from updating or deleting the row we have read. After we see
that the above query returns the parent `'Jones'', we can safely add
his child to table `CHILD', and commit our transaction.  This example
shows how to implement referential integrity in your application code.

Let us look at another example: we have an integer counter field in a
table `CHILD_CODES' which we use to assign a unique identifier to each
child we add to table `CHILD'.  Obviously, using a consistent read or a
shared mode read to read the present value of the counter is not a good
idea, since then two users of the database may see the same value for
the counter, and we will get a duplicate key error when we add the two
children with the same identifier to the table.

In this case there are two good ways to implement the reading and
incrementing of the counter: (1) update the counter first by
incrementing it by 1 and only after that read it, or (2) read the
counter first with a lock mode `FOR UPDATE', and increment after that:

     SELECT COUNTER_FIELD FROM CHILD_CODES FOR UPDATE;
     UPDATE CHILD_CODES SET COUNTER_FIELD = COUNTER_FIELD + 1;

A `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE' will read the latest available data setting
exclusive locks on each row it reads.  Thus it sets the same locks a
searched SQL `UPDATE' would set on the rows.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Next-key locking,  Next: InnoDB Locks set,  Prev: InnoDB locking reads,  Up: InnoDB transaction model

Next-key locking: avoiding the phantom problem
..............................................

In row level locking InnoDB uses an algorithm called next-key locking.
InnoDB does the row level locking so that when it searches or scans an
index of a table, it sets shared or exclusive locks on the index
records in encounters. Thus the row level locks are more precisely
called index record locks.

The locks InnoDB sets on index records also affect the 'gap' before
that index record. If a user has a shared or exclusive lock on record R
in an index, then another user cannot insert a new index record
immediately before R in the index order.  This locking of gaps is done
to prevent the so-called phantom problem. Suppose I want to read and
lock all children with identifier bigger than 100 from table `CHILD',
and update some field in the selected rows.

     SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID > 100 FOR UPDATE;

Suppose there is an index on table `CHILD' on column `ID'. Our query
will scan that index starting from the first record where `ID' is
bigger than 100.  Now, if the locks set on the index records would not
lock out inserts made in the gaps, a new child might meanwhile be
inserted to the table. If now I in my transaction execute

     SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID > 100 FOR UPDATE;

again, I will see a new child in the result set the query returns.
This is against the isolation principle of transactions: a transaction
should be able to run so that the data it has read does not change
during the transaction. If we regard a set of rows as a data item, then
the new 'phantom' child would break this isolation principle.

When InnoDB scans an index it can also lock the gap after the last
record in the index. Just that happens in the previous example: the
locks set by InnoDB will prevent any insert to the table where `ID'
would be bigger than 100.

You can use the next-key locking to implement a uniqueness check in
your application: if you read your data in share mode and do not see a
duplicate for a row you are going to insert, then you can safely insert
your row and know that the next-key lock set on the successor of your
row during the read will prevent anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate
for your row. Thus the next-key locking allows you to 'lock' the
non-existence of something in your table.

Locks set by different SQL statements in InnoDB
...............................................

   * `SELECT ... FROM ...' : this is a consistent read, reading a
     snapshot of the database and setting no locks.

   * `SELECT ... FROM ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE' : sets shared next-key
     locks on all index records the read encounters.

   * `SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE' : sets exclusive next-key locks
     on all index records the read encounters.

   * `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)' : sets an exclusive lock on the
     inserted row; note that this lock is not a next-key lock and does
     not prevent other users from inserting to the gap before the
     inserted row. If a duplicate key error occurs, sets a shared lock
     on the duplicate index record.

   * `INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...' sets an exclusive
     (non-next-key) lock on each row inserted into `T'. Does the search
     on `S' as a consistent read, but sets shared next-key locks on `S'
     if the MySQL logging is on. InnoDB has to set locks in the latter
     case because in roll-forward recovery from a backup every SQL
     statement has to be executed in exactly the same way as it was
     done originally.

   * `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ...' performs the `SELECT' as a
     consistent read or with shared locks, like in the previous item.

   * `REPLACE' is done like an insert if there is no collision on a
     unique key. Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is placed on the
     row which has to be updated.

   * `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...' : sets an exclusive next-key lock
     on every record the search encounters.

   * `DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...' : sets an exclusive next-key lock on
     every record the search encounters.

   * `LOCK TABLES ... ' : sets table locks. In the implementation the
     MySQL layer of code sets these locks. The automatic deadlock
     detection of InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks
     are involved: see the next section below. See also section 13
     'InnoDB restrictions' about the following: since MySQL does know
     about row level locks, it is possible that you get a table lock on
     a table where another user currently has row level locks. But that
     does not put transaction integerity into danger.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Deadlock detection,  Next: InnoDB Consistent read example,  Prev: InnoDB Locks set,  Up: InnoDB transaction model

Deadlock detection and rollback
...............................

InnoDB automatically detects a deadlock of transactions and rolls back
the transaction whose lock request was the last one to build a
deadlock, that is, a cycle in the waits-for graph of transactions.
InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where a lock set by a MySQL `LOCK
TABLES' statement is involved, or if a lock set in another table
handler than InnoDB is involved. You have to resolve these situations
using `innodb_lock_wait_timeout' set in `my.cnf'.

When InnoDB performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all the
locks of the transaction are released. However, if just a single SQL
statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks set
by the SQL statement may be preserved. This is because InnoDB stores
row locks in a format where it cannot afterwards know which was set by
which SQL statement.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Consistent read example,  Prev: InnoDB Deadlock detection,  Up: InnoDB transaction model

An example of how the consistent read works in InnoDB
.....................................................

When you issue a consistent read, that is, an ordinary `SELECT'
statement, InnoDB will give your transaction a timepoint according to
which your query sees the database. Thus, if transaction B deletes a
row and commits after your timepoint was assigned, then you will not
see the row deleted. Similarly with inserts and updates.

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction and then
doing another `SELECT'.

This is called multiversioned concurrency control.

                       User A                 User B
     
                   set autocommit=0;      set autocommit=0;
     time
     |             SELECT * FROM t;
     |             empty set
     |                                    INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 2);
     |
     v             SELECT * FROM t;
                   empty set
                                          COMMIT;
     
                   SELECT * FROM t;
                   empty set;
     
                   COMMIT;
     
                   SELECT * FROM t;
                   ----------------------
                   |     1    |    2   |
                   ----------------------

Thus user A sees the row inserted by B only when B has committed the
insert, and A has committed his own transaction so that the timepoint
is advanced past the the commit of B.

If you want to see the 'freshest' state of the database, you should use
a locking read:

     SELECT * FROM t LOCK IN SHARE MODE;

Performance tuning tips
-----------------------

*1.* If the Unix `top' or the Windows `Task Manager' shows that the CPU
usage percentage with your workload is less than 70 %, your workload is
probably disk-bound. Maybe you are making too many transaction commits,
or the buffer pool is too small.  Making the buffer pool bigger can
help, but do not set it bigger than 80 % of physical memory.

*2.* Wrap several modifications into one transaction. InnoDB must flush
the log to disk at each transaction commit, if that transaction made
modifications to the database. Since the rotation speed of a disk is
typically at most 167 revolutions/second, that constrains the number of
commits to the same 167/second if the disk does not fool the operating
system.

*3.* If you can afford the loss of some latest committed transactions,
you can set the `my.cnf' parameter `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit' to
zero. InnoDB tries to flush the log anyway once in a second, though the
flush is not guaranteed.

*4.* Make your log files big, even as big as the buffer pool. When
InnoDB has written the log files full, it has to write the modified
contents of the buffer pool to disk in a checkpoint. Small log files
will cause many unnecessary disk writes. The drawback in big log files
is that recovery time will be longer.

*5.* Also the log buffer should be quite big, say 8 MB.

*6.* (Relevant from 3.23.39 up.)  In some versions of Linux and Unix,
flushing files to disk with the Unix `fdatasync' and other similar
methods is surprisingly slow.  The default method InnoDB uses is the
`fdatasync' function.  If you are not satisfied with the database write
performance, you may try setting `innodb_flush_method' in `my.cnf' to
`O_DSYNC', though O_DSYNC seems to be slower on most systems.

*7.* In importing data to InnoDB, make sure that MySQL does not have
`autocommit=1' on. Then every insert requires a log flush to disk.  Put
before your plain SQL import file line

     set autocommit=0;

and after it

     commit;

If you use the `mysqldump' option `--opt', you will get dump files
which are fast to import also to an InnoDB table, even without wrapping
them to the above `set autocommit=0; ... commit;' wrappers.

*8.* Beware of big rollbacks of mass inserts: InnoDB uses the insert
buffer to save disk i/o in inserts, but in a corresponding rollback no
such mechanism is used. A disk-bound rollback can take 30 times the time
of the corresponding insert. Killing the database process will not help
because the rollback will start again at the database startup. The only
way to get rid of a runaway rollback is to increase the buffer pool so
that the rollback becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or delete the whole
InnoDB database.

*9.* Beware also of other big disk-bound operations.  Use `DROP TABLE'
or `TRUNCATE' (from MySQL-4.0 up) to empty a table, not `DELETE FROM
yourtable'.

*10.* Use the multi-line `INSERT' to reduce communication overhead
between the client and the server if you need to insert many rows:

     INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES (1, 2), (5, 5);

This tip is of course valid for inserts into any table type, not just
InnoDB.

The InnoDB Monitor
..................

Starting from version 3.23.41 InnoDB includes the InnoDB Monitor which
prints information on the InnoDB internal state.  When swithed on,
InnoDB Monitor will make the MySQL server to print data to the standard
output about once every 10 seconds. This data is useful in performance
tuning.

The printed information includes data on:
   * table and record locks held by each active transaction,

   * lock waits of a transactions,

   * semaphore waits of threads,

   * pending file i/o requests,

   * buffer pool statistics, and

   * purge and insert buffer merge activity of the main thread of
     InnoDB.

You can start InnoDB Monitor through the following SQL command:

     CREATE TABLE innodb_monitor(a int) type = innodb;

and stop it by

     DROP TABLE innodb_monitor;

The `CREATE TABLE' syntax is just a way to pass a command to the InnoDB
engine through the MySQL SQL parser: the created table is not relevant
at all for InnoDB Monitor. If you shut down the database when the
monitor is running, and you want to start the monitor again, you have
to drop the table before you can issue a new `CREATE TABLE' to start
the monitor.  This syntax may change in a future release.

Some notes on the output:

   * If the section LOCKS HELD BY TRANSACTIONS reports lock waits, then
     your application may have lock contention. The output can also
     help to trace reasons for transaction deadlocks.

   * Section SYNC INFO will report reserved semaphores if you compile
     InnoDB with <code>UNIV_SYNC_DEBUG</code> defined in
     <tt>univ.i</tt>.

   * Section SYNC ARRAY INFO reports threads waiting for a semaphore
     and statistics on how many times threads have needed a spin or a
     wait on a mutex or a rw-lock semaphore. A big number of threads
     waiting for semaphores may be a result of disk i/o, or contention
     problems inside InnoDB. Contention can be due to heavy parallelism
     of queries, or problems in operating system thread scheduling.

   * Section CURRENT PENDING FILE I/O'S lists pending file i/o
     requests. A large number of these indicates that the workload is
     disk i/o -bound.

   * Section BUFFER POOL gives you statistics on pages read and
     written. You can calculate from these numbers how many data file
     i/o's your queries are currently doing.

Implementation of multiversioning
---------------------------------

Since InnoDB is a multiversioned database, it must keep information of
old versions of rows in the tablespace. This information is stored in a
data structure we call a rollback segment after an analogous data
structure in Oracle.

InnoDB internally adds two fields to each row stored in the database.
A 6-byte field tells the transaction identifier for the last
transaction which inserted or updated the row. Also a deletion is
internally treated as an update where a special bit in the row is set
to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte field called the
roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an undo log record written to
the rollback segment. If the row was updated, then the undo log record
contains the information necessary to rebuild the content of the row
before it was updated.

InnoDB uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the undo
operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the
information to build earlier versions of a row for a consistent read.

Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update
undo logs. Insert undo logs are only needed in transaction rollback and
can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs
are used also in consistent reads, and they can be discarded only after
there is no transaction present for which InnoDB has assigned a
snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information in the
update undo log to build an earlier version of a database row.

You must remember to commit your transactions regularly. Otherwise
InnoDB cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the rollback
segment may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment is
typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated row. You
can use this information to calculate the space need for your rollback
segment.

In our multiversioning scheme a row is not physically removed from the
database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.  Only
when InnoDB can discard the update undo log record written for the
deletion, it can also physically remove the corresponding row and its
index records from the database. This removal operation is called a
purge, and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of time as
the SQL statement which did the deletion.

Table and index structures
--------------------------

Every InnoDB table has a special index called the clustered index where
the data of the rows is stored. If you define a `PRIMARY KEY' on your
table, then the index of the primary key will be the clustered index.

If you do not define a primary key for your table, InnoDB will
internally generate a clustered index where the rows are ordered by the
row id InnoDB assigns to the rows in such a table. The row id is a
6-byte field which monotonically increases as new rows are inserted.
Thus the rows ordered by the row id will be physically in the insertion
order.

Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast, because the row
data will be on the same page where the index search leads us. In many
databases the data is traditionally stored on a different page from the
index record. If a table is large, the clustered index architecture
often saves a disk i/o when compared to the traditional solution.

The records in non-clustered indexes (we also call them secondary
indexes), in InnoDB contain the primary key value for the row. InnoDB
uses this primary key value to search for the row from the clustered
index. Note that if the primary key is long, the secondary indexes will
use more space.

Physical structure of an index
..............................

All indexes in InnoDB are B-trees where the index records are stored in
the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index page is 16 kB.
When new records are inserted, InnoDB tries to leave 1 / 16 of the page
free for future insertions and updates of the index records.

If index records are inserted in a sequential (ascending or descending)
order, the resulting index pages will be about 15/16 full.  If records
are inserted in a random order, then the pages will be 1/2 - 15/16
full. If the fillfactor of an index page drops below 1/2, InnoDB will
try to contract the index tree to free the page.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Insert buffering,  Next: InnoDB Adaptive hash,  Prev: InnoDB physical structure,  Up: Table and index

Insert buffering
................

It is a common situation in a database application that the primary key
is a unique identifier and new rows are inserted in the ascending order
of the primary key. Thus the insertions to the clustered index do not
require random reads from a disk.

On the other hand, secondary indexes are usually non-unique and
insertions happen in a relatively random order into secondary indexes.
This would cause a lot of random disk i/o's without a special mechanism
used in InnoDB.

If an index record should be inserted to a non-unique secondary index,
InnoDB checks if the secondary index page is already in the buffer
pool. If that is the case, InnoDB will do the insertion directly to the
index page. But, if the index page is not found from the buffer pool,
InnoDB inserts the record to a special insert buffer structure.  The
insert buffer is kept so small that it entirely fits in the buffer
pool, and insertions can be made to it very fast.

The insert buffer is periodically merged to the secondary index trees
in the database. Often we can merge several insertions on the same page
in of the index tree, and hence save disk i/o's.  It has been measured
that the insert buffer can speed up insertions to a table up to 15
times.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Adaptive hash,  Next: InnoDB Physical record,  Prev: InnoDB Insert buffering,  Up: Table and index

Adaptive hash indexes
.....................

If a database fits almost entirely in main memory, then the fastest way
to perform queries on it is to use hash indexes. InnoDB has an
automatic mechanism which monitors index searches made to the indexes
defined for a table, and if InnoDB notices that queries could benefit
from building of a hash index, such an index is automatically built.

But note that the hash index is always built based on an existing
B-tree index on the table. InnoDB can build a hash index on a prefix of
any length of the key defined for the B-tree, depending on what search
pattern InnoDB observes on the B-tree index.  A hash index can be
partial: it is not required that the whole B-tree index is cached in
the buffer pool. InnoDB will build hash indexes on demand to those
pages of the index which are often accessed.

In a sense, through the adaptive hash index mechanism InnoDB adapts
itself to ample main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main
memory databases.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Physical record,  Prev: InnoDB Adaptive hash,  Up: Table and index

Physical record structure
.........................

   * Each index record in InnoDB contains a header of 6 bytes. The
     header is used to link consecutive records together, and also in
     the row level locking.

   * Records in the clustered index contain fields for all user-defined
     columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte field for the transaction
     id and a 7-byte field for the roll pointer.

   * If the user has not defined a primary key for a table, then each
     clustered index record contains also a 6-byte row id field.

   * Each secondary index record contains also all the fields defined
     for the clustered index key.

   * A record contains also a pointer to each field of the record.  If
     the total length of the fields in a record is < 128 bytes, then
     the pointer is 1 byte, else 2 bytes.

How an auto-increment column works in InnoDB
............................................

After a database startup, when a user first does an insert to a table
`T' where an auto-increment column has been defined, and the user does
not provide an explicit value for the column, then InnoDB executes
`SELECT MAX(auto-inc-column) FROM T', and assigns that value incremented
by one to the the column and the auto-increment counter of the table.
We say that the auto-increment counter for table `T' has been
initialized.

InnoDB follows the same procedure in initializing the auto-increment
counter for a freshly created table.

Note that if the user specifies in an insert the value 0 to the
auto-increment column, then InnoDB treats the row like the value would
not have been specified.

After the auto-increment counter has been initialized, if a user inserts
a row where he explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is
bigger than the current counter value, then the counter is set to the
specified column value. If the user does not explicitly specify a
value, then InnoDB increments the counter by one and assigns its new
value to the column.

The auto-increment mechanism, when assigning values from the counter,
bypasses locking and transaction handling. Therefore you may also get
gaps in the number sequence if you roll back transactions which have
got numbers from the counter.

The behavior of auto-increment is not defined if a user gives a negative
value to the column or if the value becomes bigger than the maximum
integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.

File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB Disk i/o,  Next: InnoDB File space,  Prev: File space management,  Up: File space management

Disk i/o
........

In disk i/o InnoDB uses asynchronous i/o. On Windows NT it uses the
native asynchronous i/o provided by the operating system.  On Unix,
InnoDB uses simulated asynchronous i/o built into InnoDB: InnoDB
creates a number of i/o threads to take care of i/o operations, such as
read-ahead. In a future version we will add support for simulated aio
on Windows NT and native aio on those versions of Unix which have one.

On Windows NT InnoDB uses non-buffered i/o. That means that the disk
pages InnoDB reads or writes are not buffered in the operating system
file cache. This saves some memory bandwidth.

Starting from 3.23.41 InnoDB uses a novel file flush technique called
doublewrite.  It adds safety to crash recovery after an operating
system crash or a power outage, and improves performance on most Unix
flavors by reducing the need for fsync operations.

Doublewrite means that InnoDB before writing pages to a data file first
writes them to a contiguous tablespace area called the doublewrite
buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite buffer
has completed, InnoDB writes the pages to their proper positions in the
data file. If the operating system crashes in the middle of a page
write, InnoDB will in recovery find a good copy of the page from the
doublewrite buffer.

Starting from 3.23.41 you can also use a raw disk partition as a data
file, though this has not been tested yet. When you create a new data
file you have to put the keyword `newraw' immediately after the data
file size in `innodb_data_file_path'. The partition must be >= than you
specify as the size. Note that 1M in InnoDB is 1024 x 1024 bytes, while
in disk specifications 1 MB usually means 1000 000 bytes.

     innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:3Gnewraw;hdd2:2Gnewraw

When you start the database again you MUST change the keyword to `raw'.
Otherwise InnoDB will write over your partition!

     innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:3Graw;hdd2:2Graw

Using a raw disk you can on some Unixes perform non-buffered i/o.

There are two read-ahead heuristics in InnoDB: sequential read-ahead
and random read-ahead. In sequential read-ahead InnoDB notices that the
access pattern to a segment in the tablespace is sequential.  Then
InnoDB will post in advance a batch of reads of database pages to the
i/o system. In random read-ahead InnoDB notices that some area in a
tablespace seems to be in the process of being fully read into the
buffer pool. Then InnoDB posts the remaining reads to the i/o system.

File space management
.....................

The data files you define in the configuration file form the tablespace
of InnoDB. The files are simply catenated to form the tablespace, there
is no striping in use.  Currently you cannot directly instruct where
the space is allocated for your tables, except by using the following
fact: from a newly created tablespace InnoDB will allocate space
starting from the low end.

The tablespace consists of database pages whose default size is 16 kB.
The pages are grouped into extents of 64 consecutive pages. The 'files'
inside a tablespace are called segments in InnoDB. The name of the
rollback segment is somewhat misleading because it actually contains
many segments in the tablespace.

For each index in InnoDB we allocate two segments: one is for non-leaf
nodes of the B-tree, the other is for the leaf nodes. The idea here is
to achieve better sequentiality for the leaf nodes, which contain the
data.

When a segment grows inside the tablespace, InnoDB allocates the first
32 pages to it individually. After that InnoDB starts to allocate whole
extents to the segment.  InnoDB can add to a large segment up to 4
extents at a time to ensure good sequentiality of data.

Some pages in the tablespace contain bitmaps of other pages, and
therefore a few extents in an InnoDB tablespace cannot be allocated to
segments as a whole, but only as individual pages.

When you issue a query `SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM ... LIKE ...' to ask for
available free space in the tablespace, InnoDB will report you the
space which is certainly usable in totally free extents of the
tablespace. InnoDB always reserves some extents for clean-up and other
internal purposes; these reserved extents are not included in the free
space.

When you delete data from a table, InnoDB will contract the
corresponding B-tree indexes. It depends on the pattern of deletes if
that frees individual pages or extents to the tablespace, so that the
freed space is available for other users. Dropping a table or deleting
all rows from it is guaranteed to release the space to other users, but
remember that deleted rows can be physically removed only in a purge
operation after they are no longer needed in transaction rollback or
consistent read.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB File Defragmenting,  Prev: InnoDB File space,  Up: File space management

Defragmenting a table
.....................

If there are random insertions or deletions in the indexes of a table,
the indexes may become fragmented. By fragmentation we mean that the
physical ordering of the index pages on the disk is not close to the
alphabetical ordering of the records on the pages, or that there are
many unused pages in the 64-page blocks which were allocated to the
index.

It can speed up index scans if you periodically use `mysqldump' to dump
the table to a text file, drop the table, and reload it from the dump.
Another way to do the defragmenting is to `ALTER' the table type to
`MyISAM' and back to `InnoDB' again.  Note that a `MyISAM' table must
fit in a single file on your operating system.

If the insertions to and index are always ascending and records are
deleted only from the end, then the the file space management algorithm
of InnoDB guarantees that fragmentation in the index will not occur.

Error handling
--------------

The error handling in InnoDB is not always the same as specified in the
ANSI SQL standards. According to the ANSI standard, any error during an
SQL statement should cause the rollback of that statement. InnoDB
sometimes rolls back only part of the statement.  The following list
specifies the error handling of InnoDB.

   * If you run out of file space in the tablespace, you will get the
     MySQL `'Table is full'' error and InnoDB rolls back the SQL
     statement.

   * A transaction deadlock or a timeout in a lock wait will give
     `'Table handler error 1000000'' and InnoDB rolls back the SQL
     statement.

   * A duplicate key error only rolls back the insert of that
     particular row, even in a statement like `INSERT INTO ... SELECT
     ...'.  This will probably change so that the SQL statement will be
     rolled back if you have not specified the `IGNORE' option in your
     statement.

   * A 'row too long' error rolls back the SQL statement.

   * Other errors are mostly detected by the MySQL layer of code, and
     they roll back the corresponding SQL statement.


File: mysql.info,  Node: InnoDB restrictions,  Next: InnoDB contact information,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: InnoDB

Some restrictions on InnoDB tables
----------------------------------

   * `SHOW TABLE STATUS' does not give accurate statistics on InnoDB
     tables, except for the physical size reserved by the table.  The
     row count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization.

   * If you try to create an unique index on a prefix of a column you
     will get an error:

          CREATE TABLE T (A CHAR(20), B INT, UNIQUE (A(5))) TYPE = InnoDB;

     If you create a non unique index on a prefix of a column, InnoDB
     will create an index over the whole column.

   * `INSERT DELAYED' is not supported for InnoDB tables.

   * The MySQL `LOCK TABLES' operation does not know of InnoDB row
     level locks set in already completed SQL statements: this means
     that you can get a table lock on a table even if there still exist
     transactions of other users which have row level locks on the same
     table. Thus your operations on the table may have to wait if they
     collide with these locks of other users. Also a deadlock is
     possible. However, this does not endanger transaction integrity,
     because the row level locks set by InnoDB will always take care of
     the integrity.  Also, a table lock prevents other transactions
     from acquiring more row level locks (in a conflicting lock mode)
     on the table.

   * You cannot have a key on a `BLOB' or `TEXT' column.

   * A table cannot contain more than 1000 columns.

   * `DELETE FROM TABLE' does not regenerate the table but instead
     deletes all rows, one by one, which is not that fast. In future
     versions of MySQL you can use `TRUNCATE' which is fast.

   * Before dropping a database with InnoDB tables one has to drop the
     individual InnoDB tables first.

   * The default database page size in InnoDB is 16 kB. By recompiling
     the code one can set it from 8 kB to 64 kB.  The maximun row
     length is slightly less than half of a database page in versions
     <= 3.23.40 of InnoDB. Starting from source release 3.23.41 BLOB and
     TEXT columns are allowed to be < 4 GB, the total row length must
     also be < 4 GB. InnoDB does not store fields whose size is <= 30
     bytes on separate pages. After InnoDB has modified the row by
     storing long fields on separate pages, the remaining length of the
     row must be slightly less than half a database page.

   * The maximum data or log file size is 2 GB or 4 GB depending on how
     large files your operating system supports. Support for > 4 GB
     files will be added to InnoDB in a future version.

   * The maximum tablespace size is 4 billion database pages. This is
     also the maximum size for a table. The minimum tablespace size is
     10 MB.

PHP is a server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language that may be used
to create dynamic Web pages.  It contains support for accessing several
databases, including MySQL.  PHP may be run as a separate program or
compiled as a module for use with the Apache Web server.

The distribution and documentation are available at the PHP web site

Common Problems with MySQL and PHP
----------------------------------

   * Error: "Maximum Execution Time Exceeded" This is a PHP limit;  Go
     into the `php3.ini' file and set the maximum execution time up
     from 30 seconds to something higher, as needed.  It is also not a
     bad idea to double the ram allowed per script to 16MB instead of 8
     MB.

   * Error: "Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function
     mysql_connect() in .."  This means that your PHP version isn't
     compiled with MySQL support.  You can either compile a dynamic
     MySQL module and load it into PHP or recompile PHP with built-in
     MySQL support.  This is described in detail in the PHP manual.

   * Error: "undefined reference to `uncompress'" This means that the
     client library is compiled with support for a compressed
     client/server protocol. The fix is to add `-lz' last when linking
     with `-lmysqlclient'.

`DBI' is a generic interface for many databases. That means that you
can write a script that works with many different database engines
without change. You need a DataBase Driver (DBD) defined for each
database type. For MySQL, this driver is called `DBD::mysql'.

`NUM_OF_PARAMS'        The number of placeholders in the prepared
                       statement.
`NULLABLE'             Which columns can be `NULL'.
`trace'                Perform tracing for debugging.

*MySQL-specific Methods*

`insertid'             The latest `AUTO_INCREMENT' value.
`is_blob'              Which columns are `BLOB' values.
`is_key'               Which columns are keys.
`is_num'               Which columns are numeric.
`is_pri_key'           Which columns are primary keys.
`is_not_null'          Which columns CANNOT be `NULL'. See `NULLABLE'.
`length'               Maximum possible column sizes.
`max_length'           Maximum column sizes actually present in result.
`NAME'                 Column names.
`NUM_OF_FIELDS'        Number of fields returned.
`table'                Table names in returned set.
`type'                 All column types.

The Perl methods are described in more detail in the following sections.
Variables used for method return values have these meanings:

`$dbh'
     Database handle

`$sth'
     Statement handle

`$rc'
     Return code (often a status)

`$rv'
     Return value (often a row count)

*Portable DBI Methods*

`connect($data_source, $username, $password)'
     Use the `connect' method to make a database connection to the data
     source. The `$data_source' value should begin with
     `DBI:driver_name:'.  Example uses of `connect' with the
     `DBD::mysql' driver:
          $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$database", $user, $password);
          $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname",
                              $user, $password);
          $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname:$port",
                              $user, $password);
     If the user name and/or password are undefined, `DBI' uses the
     values of the `DBI_USER' and `DBI_PASS' environment variables,
     respectively. If you don't specify a hostname, it defaults to
     `'localhost''. If you don't specify a port number, it defaults to
     the default MySQL port (3306).

     As of `Msql-Mysql-modules' Version 1.2009, the `$data_source'
     value allows certain modifiers:

    `mysql_read_default_file=file_name'
          Read `filename' as an option file.  For information on option
          files, see *Note Option files::.

    `mysql_read_default_group=group_name'
          The default group when reading an option file is normally the
          `[client]' group.  By specifying the
          `mysql_read_default_group' option, the default group becomes
          the `[group_name]' group.

    `mysql_compression=1'
          Use compressed communication between the client and server
          (MySQL Version 3.22.3 or later).

    `mysql_socket=/path/to/socket'
          Specify the pathname of the Unix socket that is used to
          connect to the server (MySQL Version 3.21.15 or later).

     Multiple modifiers may be given; each must be preceded by a
     semicolon.

     For example, if you want to avoid hardcoding the user name and
     password into a `DBI' script, you can take them from the user's
     `~/.my.cnf' option file instead by writing your `connect' call
     like this:

          $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                          . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf",
                          $user, $password);

     This call will read options defined for the `[client]' group in the
     option file.  If you wanted to do the same thing but use options
     specified for the `[perl]' group as well, you could use this:

          $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                          . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf"
                          . ";mysql_read_default_group=perl",
                          $user, $password);

`disconnect'
     The `disconnect' method disconnects the database handle from the
     database.  This is typically called right before you exit from the
     program.  Example:
          $rc = $dbh->disconnect;

`prepare($statement)'
     Prepares a SQL statement for execution by the database engine and
     returns a statement handle `($sth)', which you can use to invoke
     the `execute' method.  Typically you handle `SELECT' statements
     (and `SELECT'-like statements such as `SHOW', `DESCRIBE', and
     `EXPLAIN') by means of `prepare' and `execute'.  Example:
          $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement)
              or die "Can't prepare $statement: $dbh->errstr\n";

`execute'
     The `execute' method executes a prepared statement. For
     non-`SELECT' statements, `execute' returns the number of rows
     affected.  If no rows are affected, `execute' returns `"0E0"',
     which Perl treats as zero but regards as true. If an error occurs,
     `execute' returns `undef'. For `SELECT' statements, `execute' only
     starts the SQL query in the database; you need to use one of the
     `fetch_*' methods described below to retrieve the data.  Example:
          $rv = $sth->execute
                    or die "can't execute the query: $sth->errstr;

`do($statement)'
     The `do' method prepares and executes a SQL statement and returns
     the number of rows affected.  If no rows are affected, `do' returns
     `"0E0"', which Perl treats as zero but regards as true.  This
     method is generally used for non-`SELECT' statements that cannot
     be prepared in advance (due to driver limitations) or that do not
     need to be executed more than once (inserts, deletes, etc.).
     Example:
          $rv = $dbh->do($statement)
                  or die "Can't execute $statement: $dbh- >errstr\n";

     Generally the 'do' statement is MUCH faster (and is preferable)
     than prepare/execute for statements that don't contain parameters.

`quote($string)'
     The `quote' method is used to "escape" any special characters
     contained in the string and to add the required outer quotation
     marks.  Example:
          $sql = $dbh->quote($string)

`fetchrow_array'
     This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as an
     array of field values.  Example:
          while(@row = $sth->fetchrow_array) {
                  print qw($row[0]\t$row[1]\t$row[2]\n);
          }

`fetchrow_arrayref'
     This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as a
     reference to an array of field values. Example:
          while($row_ref = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
                  print qw($row_ref->[0]\t$row_ref->[1]\t$row_ref->[2]\n);
          }

`fetchrow_hashref'
     This method fetches a row of data and returns a reference to a hash
     table containing field name/value pairs. This method is not nearly
     as efficient as using array references as demonstrated above.
     Example:
          while($hash_ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
                  print qw($hash_ref->{firstname}\t$hash_ref->{lastname}\t\
                          $hash_ref- > title}\n);
          }

`fetchall_arrayref'
     This method is used to get all the data (rows) to be returned from
     the SQL statement. It returns a reference to an array of
     references to arrays for each row. You access or print the data by
     using a nested loop. Example:
          my $table = $sth->fetchall_arrayref
                          or die "$sth->errstr\n";
          my($i, $j);
          for $i ( 0 .. $#{$table} ) {
                  for $j ( 0 .. $#{$table->[$i]} ) {
                          print "$table->[$i][$j]\t";
                  }
                  print "\n";
          }

`finish'
     Indicates that no more data will be fetched from this statement
     handle. You call this method to free up the statement handle and
     any system resources associated with it.  Example:
          $rc = $sth->finish;

`rows'
     Returns the number of rows changed (updated, deleted, etc.) by the
     last command.  This is usually used after a non-`SELECT' `execute'
     statement.  Example:
          $rv = $sth->rows;

`NULLABLE'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of TRUE indicates that this column
     may contain `NULL' values.  Example:
          $null_possible = $sth->{NULLABLE};

`NUM_OF_FIELDS'
     This attribute indicates the number of fields returned by a
     `SELECT' or `SHOW FIELDS' statement.  You may use this for
     checking whether a statement returned a result: A zero value
     indicates a non-`SELECT' statement like `INSERT', `DELETE', or
     `UPDATE'.  Example:
          $nr_of_fields = $sth->{NUM_OF_FIELDS};

`data_sources($driver_name)'
     This method returns an array containing names of databases
     available to the MySQL server on the host `'localhost''.  Example:
          @dbs = DBI->data_sources("mysql");

`ChopBlanks'
     This attribute determines whether the `fetchrow_*' methods will
     chop leading and trailing blanks from the returned values.
     Example:
          $sth->{'ChopBlanks'} =1;

`trace($trace_level)'
`trace($trace_level, $trace_filename)'
     The `trace' method enables or disables tracing.  When invoked as a
     `DBI' class method, it affects tracing for all handles.  When
     invoked as a database or statement handle method, it affects
     tracing for the given handle (and any future children of the
     handle).  Setting `$trace_level' to 2 provides detailed trace
     information.  Setting `$trace_level' to 0 disables tracing.  Trace
     output goes to the standard error output by default.  If
     `$trace_filename' is specified, the file is opened in append mode
     and output for _all_ traced handles is written to that file.
     Example:
          DBI->trace(2);                # trace everything
          DBI->trace(2,"/tmp/dbi.out"); # trace everything to
                                        # /tmp/dbi.out
          $dth->trace(2);               # trace this database handle
          $sth->trace(2);               # trace this statement handle

     You can also enable `DBI' tracing by setting the `DBI_TRACE'
     environment variable.  Setting it to a numeric value is equivalent
     to calling `DBI->(value)'.  Setting it to a pathname is equivalent
     to calling `DBI->(2,value)'.

*MySQL-specific Methods*

The methods shown below are MySQL-specific and not part of the `DBI'
standard.  Several of them are now deprecated: `is_blob', `is_key',
`is_num', `is_pri_key', `is_not_null', `length', `max_length', and
`table'.  Where `DBI'-standard alternatives exist, they are noted below:

`insertid'
     If you use the `AUTO_INCREMENT' feature of MySQL, the new
     auto-incremented values will be stored here.  Example:
          $new_id = $sth->{insertid};

     As an alternative, you can use `$dbh->{'mysql_insertid'}'.

`is_blob'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
     respective column is a `BLOB'.  Example:
          $keys = $sth->{is_blob};

`is_key'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
     respective column is a key.  Example:
          $keys = $sth->{is_key};

`is_num'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
     respective column contains numeric values.  Example:
          $nums = $sth->{is_num};

`is_pri_key'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
     respective column is a primary key.  Example:
          $pri_keys = $sth->{is_pri_key};

`is_not_null'
     Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each
     element of the array, a value of FALSE indicates that this column
     may contain `NULL' values.  Example:
          $not_nulls = $sth->{is_not_null};

     `is_not_null' is deprecated; it is preferable to use the
     `NULLABLE' attribute (described above), because that is a DBI
     standard.

`length'
`max_length'
     Each of these methods returns a reference to an array of column
     sizes.  The `length' array indicates the maximum possible sizes
     that each column may be (as declared in the table description).
     The `max_length' array indicates the maximum sizes actually
     present in the result table.  Example:

          $lengths = $sth->{length};
          $max_lengths = $sth->{max_length};

`NAME'
     Returns a reference to an array of column names.  Example:
          $names = $sth->{NAME};

`table'
     Returns a reference to an array of table names.  Example:
          $tables = $sth->{table};

`type'
     Returns a reference to an array of column types.  Example:
          $types = $sth->{type};

chapter will teach you how to install *MyODBC*, and how to use it.
Here, you will also find a list of common programs that are known to
work with *MyODBC*.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Installing MyODBC,  Next: ODBC administrator,  Prev: ODBC,  Up: ODBC

How To Install MyODBC
---------------------

*MyODBC* is a 32-bit ODBC (2.50) level 0 (with level 1 and level 2
features) driver for connecting an ODBC-aware application to MySQL.
*MyODBC* works on Windows95, Windows98, NT, and on most Unix platforms.

*MyODBC* is in public domain, and you can find the newest version at
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html'.

If you have problem with *MyODBC* and your program also works with
OLEDB, you should try the OLEDB driver that you can find in the Contrib
section.  *Note Contrib::.

Normally you only need to install *MyODBC* on Windows machines.  You
only need *MyODBC* for Unix if you have a program like ColdFusion that
is running on the Unix machine and uses ODBC to connect to the
databases.

If you want to install *MyODBC* on a Unix box, you will also need an
*ODBC* manager.  *MyODBC* is known to work with most of the Unix ODBC
managers.  You can find a list at these in the *ODBC*-related links
section on the MySQL useful links page.  *Note Useful Links::.

To install *MyODBC* on Windows, you should download the appropriate
*MyODBC* .zip file (for Windows or NT/Win2000), unpack it with
`WINZIP', or some similar program, and execute the `SETUP.EXE' file.

On Windows/NT you may get the following error when trying to install
*MyODBC*:

     An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
     Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
     use ODBC)

The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing `Ignore' to copy the rest of
the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If this
doesn't work, the solution is to reboot your computer in "safe mode"
(Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts Windows
during rebooting), install *MyODBC*, and reboot to normal mode.

   * To make a connection to a Unix box from a Windows box, with an ODBC
     application (one that doesn't support MySQL natively), you must
     first install *MyODBC* on the Windows machine.

   * The user and Windows machine must have the access privileges to the
     MySQL server on the Unix machine.  This is set up with the `GRANT'
     command. *Note `GRANT': GRANT.

   * You must create an ODBC DSN entry as follows:

        - Open the Control Panel on the Windows machine.

        - Double-click the ODBC Data Sources 32 bits icon.

        - Click the tab User DSN.

        - Click the button Add.

        - Select MySQL in the screen Create New Data Source and click
          the Finish button.

        - The MySQL Driver default configuration screen is shown.
          *Note ODBC administrator::.

   * Now start your application and select the ODBC driver with the DSN
     you specified in the ODBC administrator.

Notice that there are other configuration options on the screen of
MySQL (trace, don't prompt on connect, etc) that you can try if you run
into problems.

How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three possibilities for specifying the server name on
Windows95:

   * Use the IP address of the server.

   * Add a file `\windows\lmhosts' with the following information:

          ip hostname

     For example:

          194.216.84.21 my_hostname

   * Configure the PC to use DNS.

Example of how to fill in the `ODBC setup':
     Windows DSN name:   test
     Description:        This is my test database
     MySql Database:     test
     Server:             194.216.84.21
     User:               monty
     Password:           my_password
     Port:

The value for the `Windows DSN name' field is any name that is unique
in your Windows ODBC setup.

You don't have to specify values for the `Server', `User', `Password',
or `Port' fields in the ODBC setup screen.  However, if you do, the
values will be used as the defaults later when you attempt to make a
connection.  You have the option of changing the values at that time.

If the port number is not given, the default port (3306) is used.

If you specify the option `Read options from C:\my.cnf', the groups
`client' and `odbc' will be read from the `C:\my.cnf' file.  You can
use all options that are usable by `mysql_options()'.  *Note
`mysql_options': mysql_options.


File: mysql.info,  Node: MyODBC connect parameters,  Next: ODBC Problems,  Prev: ODBC administrator,  Up: ODBC

Connect parameters for MyODBC
-----------------------------

One can specify the following parameters for *MyODBC* on the
`[Servername]' section of an `ODBC.INI' file or through  the
`InConnectionString' argument in the `SQLDriverConnect()' call.

*Parameter*    *Default       *Comment*
               value*         
user           ODBC (on       The username used to connect to MySQL.
               Windows)       
server         localhost      The hostname of the MySQL server.
database                      The default database
option         0              A integer by which you can specify how
                              *MyODBC* should work. See below.
port           3306           The TCP/IP port to use if `server' is not
                              `localhost'.
stmt                          A statement that will be executed when
                              connection to `MySQL'.
password                      The password for the `server' `user'
                              combination.
socket                        The socket or Windows pipe to connect to.

The option argument is used to tell *MyODBC* that the client isn't 100%
ODBC compliant. On Windows, one normally sets the option flag by
toggling the different options on the connection screen but one can also
set this in the opton argument. The following options are listed in the
same order as they appear in the *MyODBC* connect screen:

*Bit*   *Meaning*
1       The client can't handle that *MyODBC* returns the real width of
        a column.
2       The client can't handle that MySQL returns the true value of
        affected rows.  If this flag is set then MySQL returns 'found
        rows' instead.  One must have MySQL 3.21.14 or newer to get this
        to work.
4       Make a debug log in c:\myodbc.log.  This is the same as putting
        `MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,c::\myodbc.log' in `AUTOEXEC.BAT'
8       Don't set any packet limit for results and parameters.
16      Don't prompt for questions even if driver would like to prompt
32      Simulate a ODBC 1.0 driver in some context.
64      Ignore use of database name in 'database.table.column'.
128     Force use of ODBC manager cursors (experimental).
256     Disable the use of extended fetch (experimental)
512     Pad CHAR fields to full column length.

The default `MYODBC.DLL' is compiled for optimal performance.  If you
want to to debug *MyODBC* (for example to enable tracing), you should
instead use `MYODBCD.DLL'.  To install this file, copy `MYODBCD.DLL'
over the installed `MYODBC.DLL' file.

How to Report Problems with MyODBC
----------------------------------

*MyODBC* has been tested with Access, Admndemo.exe, C++-Builder,
Borland Builder 4, Centura Team Developer (formerly Gupta SQL/Windows),
ColdFusion (on Solaris and NT with svc pack 5), Crystal Reports,
DataJunction, Delphi, ERwin, Excel, iHTML, FileMaker Pro, FoxPro, Notes
4.5/4.6, SBSS, Perl DBD-ODBC, Paradox, Powerbuilder, Powerdesigner 32
bit, VC++, and Visual Basic.

If you know of any other applications that work with *MyODBC*, please
send mail to <myodbc@lists.mysql.com> about this!

With some programs you may get an error like: `Another user has
modifies the record that you have modified'. In most cases this can be
solved by doing one of the following things:

   * Add a primary key for the table if there isn't one already.

   * Add a timestamp column if there isn't one already.

   * Only use double float fields. Some programs may fail when they
     compare single floats.

If the above doesn't help, you should do a `MyODBC' trace file and try
to figure out why things go wrong.

Programs Known to Work with MyODBC
----------------------------------

Most programs should work with *MyODBC*, but for each of those listed
below, we have tested it ourselves or received confirmation from some
user that it works:

*Program*
     *Comment*

Access
     To make Access work:
        * If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the
          newest (version 2.6 or above) Microsoft MDAC (`Microsoft Data
          Access Components') from `http://www.microsoft.com/data'.
          This will fix the following bug in Access: when you export
          data to MySQL, the table and column names aren't specified.
          Another way to around this bug is to upgrade to MyODBC
          Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version 3.23.x, which together
          provide a workaround for this bug!

          You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service
          Pack 5 (SP5) which can be found here
          `http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q
          239/1/14.ASP'.  This will fix some cases where columns are
          marked as `#deleted#' in Access.

          Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to
          apply the MDAC patch and use MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and
          above to go around this problem.

        * Set the "Return matching rows" MyODBC option field when
          connecting to MySQL.

        * You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or
          updated rows may show up as `#Deleted#'.

        * You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able
          to update.  For maximum portability `TIMESTAMP(14)' or simple
          `TIMESTAMP' is recommended instead of other `TIMESTAMP(X)'
          variations.

        * Only use double float fields. Access fails when comparing
          with single floats.  The symptom usually is that new or
          updated rows may show up as `#Deleted#' or that you can't
          find or update rows.

        * If you still get the error `Another user has changed your
          data' after adding a `TIMESTAMP' column, the following trick
          may help you:

          Don't use `table' data sheet view. Create instead a form with
          the fields you want, and use that `form' data sheet view.
          You should set the `DefaultValue' property for the
          `TIMESTAMP' column to `NOW()'.  It may be a good idea to hide
          the `TIMESTAMP' column from view so your users are not
          confused.

        * Access on NT will report `BLOB' columns as `OLE OBJECTS'. If
          you want to have `MEMO' columns instead, you should change the
          column to `TEXT' with `ALTER TABLE'.

        * Access can't always handle `DATE' columns properly. If you
          have a problem with these, change the columns to `DATETIME'.

        * In some cases, Access may generate illegal SQL queries that
          MySQL can't understand. You can fix this by selecting
          `"Query|SQLSpecific|Pass-Through"' from the Access menu.

        * If you have in Access a column defined as BYTE, Access will
          try to export this as `TINYINT' instead of `TINYINT
          UNSIGNED'.  This will give you problems if you have values >
          127 in the column!

        * If you are using Access 7.0, You should use the option flag
          `Return matching rows'.

        * If you are using Access 2.0, You should use the option flags
          `Return matching rows' and `Simulate ODBC 1.0'.

ADO
     When you are coding with the ADO API and *MyODBC* you need to put
     attention in some default properties that aren't supported by the
     MySQL server.  For example, using the `CursorLocation Property' as
     `adUseServer' will return for the `RecordCount Property' a result
     of -1. To have the right value, you need to set this property to
     `adUseClient', like is showing in the VB code below:

          Dim myconn As New ADODB.Connection
          Dim myrs As New Recordset
          Dim mySQL As String
          Dim myrows As Long
          
          myconn.Open "DSN=MyODBCsample"
          mySQL = "SELECT * from user"
          myrs.Source = mySQL
          Set myrs.ActiveConnection = myconn
          myrs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
          myrs.Open
          myrows = myrs.RecordCount
          
          myrs.Close
          myconn.Close

     Another workaround is to use a `SELECT COUNT(*)' statement for a
     similar query to get the correct row count.

Active server pages (ASP)
     You should use the option flag `Return matching rows'.

BDE applications
     To get these to work, you should set the option flags `Don't
     optimize column widths' and `Return matching rows'.

Borland Builder 4
     When you start a query you can use the property `Active' or use the
     method `Open'.  Note that `Active' will start by automatically
     issuing a `SELECT * FROM ...' query that may not be a good thing if
     your tables are big!

ColdFusion (On Unix)
     The following information is taken from the ColdFusion
     documentation:

     Use the following information to configure ColdFusion Server for
     Linux to use the unixODBC driver with *MyODBC* for MySQL data
     sources.  Allaire has verified that *MyODBC* Version 2.50.26 works
     with MySQL Version 3.22.27 and ColdFusion for Linux. (Any newer
     version should also work.) You can download *MyODBC* at
     `http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html'

     ColdFusion Version 4.5.1 allows you to us the ColdFusion
     Administrator to add the MySQL data source. However, the driver is
     not included with ColdFusion Version 4.5.1. Before the MySQL driver
     will appear in the ODBC datasources drop-down list, you must build
     and copy the *MyODBC* driver to `/opt/coldfusion/lib/libmyodbc.so'.

     The Contrib directory contains the program mydsn-xxx.zip which
     allows you to build and remove the DSN registry file for the
     MyODBC driver on Coldfusion applications.

DataJunction
     You have to change it to output `VARCHAR' rather than `ENUM', as
     it exports the latter in a manner that causes MySQL grief.

Excel
     Works. Some tips:
        * If you have problems with dates, try to select them as
          strings using the `CONCAT()' function. For example:
               select CONCAT(rise_time), CONCAT(set_time)
                   from sunrise_sunset;
          Values retrieved as strings this way should be correctly
          recognized as time values by Excel97.

          The purpose of `CONCAT()' in this example is to fool ODBC
          into thinking the column is of "string type". Without the
          `CONCAT()', ODBC knows the column is of time type, and Excel
          does not understand that.

          Note that this is a bug in Excel, because it automatically
          converts a string to a time. This would be great if the
          source was a text file, but is plain stupid when the source
          is an ODBC connection that reports exact types for each
          column.

Word
     To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
     use the `MyODBC' driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

     For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:

        * Insert rows using the `mysql' client command-line tool.

        * Create a DSN file using the MyODBC driver, for example, my
          for the db above.

        * Open the Word application.

        * Create a blank new documentation.

        * Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert
          database.

        * Press the button Get Data.

        * At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms
          Query.

        * In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file
          my.

        * Select the new query.

        * Select the columns that you want.

        * Make a filter if you want.

        * Make a Sort if you want.

        * Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.

        * Click Finish.

        * Click Insert data and select the records.

        * Click OK and you see the rows in your Word document.

Delphi
     You must use BDE Version 3.2 or newer.  Set the `Don't optimize
     column width' option field when connecting to MySQL.

     Also, here is some potentially useful Delphi code that sets up
     both an ODBC entry and a BDE entry for *MyODBC* (the BDE entry
     requires a BDE Alias Editor that is free at a Delphi Super Page
     near you. (Thanks to Bryan Brunton <bryan@flesherfab.com> for
     this):

          fReg:= TRegistry.Create;
            fReg.OpenKey('\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\DocumentsFab', True);
            fReg.WriteString('Database', 'Documents');
            fReg.WriteString('Description', ' ');
            fReg.WriteString('Driver', 'C:\WINNT\System32\myodbc.dll');
            fReg.WriteString('Flag', '1');

            Memo1.Lines.Add('LANGDRIVER=');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('MAX ROWS=-1');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('SCHEMA CACHE DIR=');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('SCHEMA CACHE SIZE=8');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('SCHEMA CACHE TIME=-1');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('SQLPASSTHRU MODE=SHARED AUTOCOMMIT');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('SQLQRYMODE=');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('ENABLE SCHEMA CACHE=FALSE');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('ENABLE BCD=FALSE');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('ROWSET SIZE=20');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('BLOBS TO CACHE=64');
            Memo1.Lines.Add('BLOB SIZE=32');
          
            AliasEditor.Add('DocumentsFab','MySQL',Memo1.Lines);

C++ Builder
     Tested with BDE Version 3.0. The only known problem is that when
     the table schema changes, query fields are not updated. BDE,
     however, does not seem to recognize primary keys, only the index
     PRIMARY, though this has not been a problem.

Vision
     You should use the option flag `Return matching rows'.

Visual Basic
     To be able to update a table, you must define a primary key for
     the table.

     Visual Basic with ADO can't handle big integers. This means that
     some queries like `SHOW PROCESSLIST' will not work properly.  The
     fix is to set add the option `OPTION=16834' in the ODBC connect
     string or set the `Change BIGINT columns to INT' option in the
     MyODBC connect screen.  You may also want to set the `Return
     matching rows' option.

VisualInterDev
     If you get the error `[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver does
     not support this parameter' the reason may be that you have a
     `BIGINT' in your result.  Try setting the `Change BIGINT columns
     to INT' option in the MyODBC connect screen.

Visual Objects
     You should use the option flag `Don't optimize column widths'.

How to Get the Value of an `AUTO_INCREMENT' Column in ODBC
----------------------------------------------------------

A common problem is how to get the value of an automatically generated
ID from an `INSERT'. With ODBC, you can do something like this (assuming
that `auto' is an `AUTO_INCREMENT' field):

     INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
     SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();

Or, if you are just going to insert the ID into another table, you can
do this:

     INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
     INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');

*Note Getting unique ID::.

For the benefit of some ODBC applications (at least Delphi and Access),
the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row:
     SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL;


File: mysql.info,  Node: MyODBC bug report,  Prev: ODBC and last_insert_id,  Up: ODBC

Reporting Problems with MyODBC
------------------------------

If you encounter difficulties with *MyODBC*, you should start by making
a log file from the ODBC manager (the log you get when requesting logs
from ODBCADMIN) and a *MyODBC* log.

To get a *MyODBC* log, you need to do the following:

  1. Ensure that you are using `myodbcd.dll' and not `myodbc.dll'.  The
     easiest way to do this is to get `myodbcd.dll' from the MyODBC
     distribution and copy it over the `myodbc.dll', which is probably
     in your `C:\windows\system32' or `C:\winnt\system32' directory.

     Note that you probably want to restore the old myodbc.dll file
     when you have finished testing, as this is a lot faster than
     `myodbcd.dll'.

  2. Tag the `Trace MyODBC' option flag in the *MyODBC*
     connect/configure screen.  The log will be written to file
     `C:\myodbc.log'.

     If the trace option is not remembered when you are going back to
     the above screen, it means that you are not using the `myodbcd.dll'
     driver (see above).

  3. Start your application and try to get it to fail.

Check the `MyODBC trace file', to find out what could be wrong.  You
should be able to find out the issued queries by searching after the
string `>mysql_real_query' in the `myodbc.log' file.

You should also try duplicating the queries in the `mysql' monitor or
`admndemo' to find out if the error is MyODBC or MySQL.

If you find out something is wrong, please only send the relevant rows
(max 40 rows) to <myodbc@lists.mysql.com>.  Please never send the whole
MyODBC or ODBC log file!

If you are unable to find out what's wrong, the last option is to make
an archive (tar or zip) that contains a MyODBC trace file, the ODBC log
file, and a README file that explains the problem.  You can send this
to `ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret'.  Only we at MySQL AB
will have access to the files you upload, and we will be very discrete
with the data!

If you can create a program that also shows this problem, please upload
this too!

If the program works with some other SQL server, you should make an
ODBC log file where you do exactly the same thing in the other SQL
server.

Remember that the more information you can supply to us, the more
likely it is that we can fix the problem!

* Building clients::            Building Client Programs
* Threaded clients::            How to Make a Threaded Client

The C API code is distributed with MySQL. It is included in the
`mysqlclient' library and allows C programs to access a database.

Many of the clients in the MySQL source distribution are written in C.
If you are looking for examples that demonstrate how to use the C API,
take a look at these clients. You can find these in the `clients'
directory in the MySQL source distribution.

Most of the other client APIs (all except Java) use the `mysqlclient'
library to communicate with the MySQL server. This means that, for
example, you can take advantage of many of the same environment
variables that are used by other client programs, because they are
referenced from the library.  See *Note Client-Side Scripts::, for a
list of these variables.

The client has a maximum communication buffer size. The size of the
buffer that is allocated initially (16K bytes) is automatically
increased up to the maximum size (the maximum is 16M). Because buffer
sizes are increased only as demand warrants, simply increasing the
default maximum limit does not in itself cause more resources to be
used. This size check is mostly a check for erroneous queries and
communication packets.

The communication buffer must be large enough to contain a single SQL
statement (for client-to-server traffic) and one row of returned data
(for server-to-client traffic).  Each thread's communication buffer is
dynamically enlarged to handle any query or row up to the maximum
limit.  For example, if you have `BLOB' values that contain up to 16M
of data, you must have a communication buffer limit of at least 16M (in
both server and client).  The client's default maximum is 16M, but the
default maximum in the server is 1M.  You can increase this by changing
the value of the `max_allowed_packet' parameter when the server is
started.  *Note Server parameters::.

The MySQL server shrinks each communication buffer to
`net_buffer_length' bytes after each query.  For clients, the size of
the buffer associated with a connection is not decreased until the
connection is closed, at which time client memory is reclaimed.

For programming with threads, consult the 'how to make a thread-safe
client' chapter. *Note Threaded clients::.

C API Datatypes
---------------

`MYSQL'
     This structure represents a handle to one database connection. It
     is used for almost all MySQL functions.

`MYSQL_RES'
     This structure represents the result of a query that returns rows
     (`SELECT', `SHOW', `DESCRIBE', `EXPLAIN').  The information
     returned from a query is called the _result set_ in the remainder
     of this section.

`MYSQL_ROW'
     This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is
     currently implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You
     cannot treat these as null-terminated strings if field values may
     contain binary data, because such values may contain null bytes
     internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling `mysql_fetch_row()'.

`MYSQL_FIELD'
     This structure contains information about a field, such as the
     field's name, type, and size. Its members are described in more
     detail below.  You may obtain the `MYSQL_FIELD' structures for
     each field by calling `mysql_fetch_field()' repeatedly.  Field
     values are not part of this structure; they are contained in a
     `MYSQL_ROW' structure.

`MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET'
     This is a type-safe representation of an offset into a MySQL field
     list.  (Used by `mysql_field_seek()'.)  Offsets are field numbers
     within a row, beginning at zero.

`my_ulonglong'
     The type used for the number of rows and for
     `mysql_affected_rows()', `mysql_num_rows()', and
     `mysql_insert_id()'. This type provides a range of `0' to
     `1.84e19'.

     On some systems, attempting to print a value of type `my_ulonglong'
     will not work.  To print such a value, convert it to `unsigned
     long' and use a `%lu' print format.  Example:
          printf (Number of rows: %lu\n", (unsigned long) mysql_num_rows(result));

The `MYSQL_FIELD' structure contains the members listed below:

`char * name'
     The name of the field, as a null-terminated string.

`char * table'
     The name of the table containing this field, if it isn't a
     calculated field.  For calculated fields, the `table' value is an
     empty string.

`char * def'
     The default value of this field, as a null-terminated string.
     This is set only if you use `mysql_list_fields()'.

`enum enum_field_types type'
     The type of the field.  The `type' value may be one of the
     following:

     *Type value*         *Type meaning*
     `FIELD_TYPE_TINY'    `TINYINT' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_SHORT'   `SMALLINT' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_LONG'    `INTEGER' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_INT24'   `MEDIUMINT' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_LONGLONG'`BIGINT' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_DECIMAL' `DECIMAL' or `NUMERIC' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_FLOAT'   `FLOAT' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_DOUBLE'  `DOUBLE' or `REAL' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP'`TIMESTAMP' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_DATE'    `DATE' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_TIME'    `TIME' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_DATETIME'`DATETIME' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_YEAR'    `YEAR' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_STRING'  String (`CHAR' or `VARCHAR') field
     `FIELD_TYPE_BLOB'    `BLOB' or `TEXT' field (use
                          `max_length' to determine the
                          maximum length)
     `FIELD_TYPE_SET'     `SET' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_ENUM'    `ENUM' field
     `FIELD_TYPE_NULL'    `NULL'-type field
     `FIELD_TYPE_CHAR'    Deprecated; use `FIELD_TYPE_TINY'
                          instead

     You can use the `IS_NUM()' macro to test whether or not a field
     has a numeric type.  Pass the `type' value to `IS_NUM()' and it
     will evaluate to TRUE if the field is numeric:

          if (IS_NUM(field->type))
              printf("Field is numeric\n");

`unsigned int length'
     The width of the field, as specified in the table definition.

`unsigned int max_length'
     The maximum width of the field for the result set (the length of
     the longest field value for the rows actually in the result set).
     If you use `mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_list_fields()', this
     contains the maximum length for the field.  If you use
     `mysql_use_result()', the value of this variable is zero.

`unsigned int flags'
     Different bit-flags for the field.  The `flags' value may have zero
     or more of the following bits set:

     *Flag value*         *Flag meaning*
     `NOT_NULL_FLAG'      Field can't be `NULL'
     `PRI_KEY_FLAG'       Field is part of a primary key
     `UNIQUE_KEY_FLAG'    Field is part of a unique key
     `MULTIPLE_KEY_FLAG'  Field is part of a non-unique key
     `UNSIGNED_FLAG'      Field has the `UNSIGNED' attribute
     `ZEROFILL_FLAG'      Field has the `ZEROFILL' attribute
     `BINARY_FLAG'        Field has the `BINARY' attribute
     `AUTO_INCREMENT_FLAG'Field has the `AUTO_INCREMENT'
                          attribute
     `ENUM_FLAG'          Field is an `ENUM' (deprecated)
     `BLOB_FLAG'          Field is a `BLOB' or `TEXT'
                          (deprecated)
     `TIMESTAMP_FLAG'     Field is a `TIMESTAMP' (deprecated)

     Use of the `BLOB_FLAG', `ENUM_FLAG', and `TIMESTAMP_FLAG' flags is
     deprecated because they indicate the type of a field rather than
     an attribute of its type.  It is preferable to test `field->type'
     against `FIELD_TYPE_BLOB', `FIELD_TYPE_ENUM', or
     `FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP' instead.

     The example below illustrates a typical use of the `flags' value:

          if (field->flags & NOT_NULL_FLAG)
              printf("Field can't be null\n");

     You may use the following convenience macros to determine the
     boolean status of the `flags' value:

     `IS_NOT_NULL(flags)' True if this field is defined as
                          `NOT NULL'
     `IS_PRI_KEY(flags)'  True if this field is a primary
                          key
     `IS_BLOB(flags)'     True if this field is a `BLOB' or
                          `TEXT' (deprecated; test
                          `field->type' instead)

`unsigned int decimals'
     The number of decimals for numeric fields.

*mysql_use_result()*    Initiates a row-by-row result set retrieval.

To connect to the server, call `mysql_init()' to initialize a
connection handler, then call `mysql_real_connect()' with that handler
(along with other information such as the hostname, user name, and
password).  Upon connection, `mysql_real_connect()' sets the
`reconnect' flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of `1'. This
flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be performed because
of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the server before giving
up.  When you are done with the connection, call `mysql_close()' to
terminate it.

While a connection is active, the client may send SQL queries to the
server using `mysql_query()' or `mysql_real_query()'.  The difference
between the two is that `mysql_query()' expects the query to be
specified as a null-terminated string whereas `mysql_real_query()'
expects a counted string.  If the string contains binary data (which may
include null bytes), you must use `mysql_real_query()'.

For each non-`SELECT' query (for example, `INSERT', `UPDATE',
`DELETE'), you can find out how many rows were changed (affected) by
calling `mysql_affected_rows()'.

For `SELECT' queries, you retrieve the selected rows as a result set.
(Note that some statements are `SELECT'-like in that they return rows.
These include `SHOW', `DESCRIBE', and `EXPLAIN'.  They should be
treated the same way as `SELECT' statements.)

There are two ways for a client to process result sets.  One way is to
retrieve the entire result set all at once by calling
`mysql_store_result()'.  This function acquires from the server all the
rows returned by the query and stores them in the client.  The second
way is for the client to initiate a row-by-row result set retrieval by
calling `mysql_use_result()'.  This function initializes the retrieval,
but does not actually get any rows from the server.

In both cases, you access rows by calling `mysql_fetch_row()'.  With
`mysql_store_result()', `mysql_fetch_row()' accesses rows that have
already been fetched from the server.  With `mysql_use_result()',
`mysql_fetch_row()' actually retrieves the row from the server.
Information about the size of the data in each row is available by
calling `mysql_fetch_lengths()'.

After you are done with a result set, call `mysql_free_result()' to
free the memory used for it.

The two retrieval mechanisms are complementary.  Client programs should
choose the approach that is most appropriate for their requirements.
In practice, clients tend to use `mysql_store_result()' more commonly.

An advantage of `mysql_store_result()' is that because the rows have all
been fetched to the client, you not only can access rows sequentially,
you can move back and forth in the result set using `mysql_data_seek()'
or `mysql_row_seek()' to change the current row position within the
result set.  You can also find out how many rows there are by calling
`mysql_num_rows()'.  On the other hand, the memory requirements for
`mysql_store_result()' may be very high for large result sets and you
are more likely to encounter out-of-memory conditions.

An advantage of `mysql_use_result()' is that the client requires less
memory for the result set because it maintains only one row at a time
(and because there is less allocation overhead, `mysql_use_result()'
can be faster).  Disadvantages are that you must process each row
quickly to avoid tying up the server, you don't have random access to
rows within the result set (you can only access rows sequentially), and
you don't know how many rows are in the result set until you have
retrieved them all.  Furthermore, you _must_ retrieve all the rows even
if you determine in mid-retrieval that you've found the information you
were looking for.

The API makes it possible for clients to respond appropriately to
queries (retrieving rows only as necessary) without knowing whether or
not the query is a `SELECT'.  You can do this by calling
`mysql_store_result()' after each `mysql_query()' (or
`mysql_real_query()').  If the result set call succeeds, the query was
a `SELECT' and you can read the rows.  If the result set call fails,
call `mysql_field_count()' to determine whether or not a result was
actually to be expected.  If `mysql_field_count()' returns zero, the
query returned no data (indicating that it was an `INSERT', `UPDATE',
`DELETE', etc.), and was not expected to return rows.  If
`mysql_field_count()' is non-zero, the query should have returned rows,
but didn't.  This indicates that the query was a `SELECT' that failed.
See the description for `mysql_field_count()' for an example of how
this can be done.

Both `mysql_store_result()' and `mysql_use_result()' allow you to
obtain information about the fields that make up the result set (the
number of fields, their names and types, etc.).  You can access field
information sequentially within the row by calling
`mysql_fetch_field()' repeatedly, or by field number within the row by
calling `mysql_fetch_field_direct()'.  The current field cursor
position may be changed by calling `mysql_field_seek()'.  Setting the
field cursor affects subsequent calls to `mysql_fetch_field()'.  You
can also get information for fields all at once by calling
`mysql_fetch_fields()'.

For detecting and reporting errors, MySQL provides access to error
information by means of the `mysql_errno()' and `mysql_error()'
functions.  These return the error code or error message for the most
recently invoked function that can succeed or fail, allowing you to
determine when an error occurred and what it was.

In the descriptions below, a parameter or return value of `NULL' means
`NULL' in the sense of the C programming language, not a MySQL `NULL'
value.

Functions that return a value generally return a pointer or an integer.
Unless specified otherwise, functions returning a pointer return a
non-`NULL' value to indicate success or a `NULL' value to indicate an
error, and functions returning an integer return zero to indicate
success or non-zero to indicate an error.  Note that "non-zero" means
just that.  Unless the function description says otherwise, do not test
against a value other than zero:

     if (result)                   /* correct */
         ... error ...
     
     if (result < 0)               /* incorrect */
         ... error ...
     
     if (result == -1)             /* incorrect */
         ... error ...

When a function returns an error, the *Errors* subsection of the
function description lists the possible types of errors.  You can find
out which of these occurred by calling `mysql_errno()'.  A string
representation of the error may be obtained by calling `mysql_error()'.


File: mysql.info,  Node: mysql_affected_rows,  Next: mysql_close,  Prev: C API functions,  Up: C API functions

`mysql_affected_rows()'
.......................

`my_ulonglong mysql_affected_rows(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

Returns the number of rows changed by the last `UPDATE', deleted by the
last `DELETE' or inserted by the last `INSERT' statement. May be called
immediately after `mysql_query()' for `UPDATE', `DELETE', or `INSERT'
statements.  For `SELECT' statements, `mysql_affected_rows()' works like
`mysql_num_rows()'.

Return Values
.............

An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected or
retrieved.  Zero indicates that no records where updated for an
`UPDATE' statement, no rows matched the `WHERE' clause in the query or
that no query has yet been executed.  -1 indicates that the query
returned an error or that, for a `SELECT' query,
`mysql_affected_rows()' was called prior to calling
`mysql_store_result()'.

Errors
......

None.

Example
.......

     mysql_query(&mysql,"UPDATE products SET cost=cost*1.25 WHERE group=10");
     printf("%ld products updated",(long) mysql_affected_rows(&mysql));

If one specifies the flag `CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS' when connecting to
`mysqld', `mysql_affected_rows()' will return the number of rows
matched by the `WHERE' statement for `UPDATE' statements.

Note that when one uses a `REPLACE' command, `mysql_affected_rows()'
will return 2 if the new row replaced and old row.  This is because in
this case one row was inserted and then the duplicate was deleted.


File: mysql.info,  Node: mysql_close,  Next: mysql_connect,  Prev: mysql_affected_rows,  Up: C API functions

`mysql_close()'
...............

`void mysql_close(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

Closes a previously opened connection.  `mysql_close()' also deallocates
the connection handle pointed to by `mysql' if the handle was allocated
automatically by `mysql_init()' or `mysql_connect()'.

Return Values
.............

None.

Errors
......

None.


File: mysql.info,  Node: mysql_connect,  Next: mysql_change_user,  Prev: mysql_close,  Up: C API functions

`mysql_connect()'
.................

`MYSQL *mysql_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
const char *passwd)'

Description
...........

This function is deprecated.  It is preferable to use
`mysql_real_connect()' instead.

`mysql_connect()' attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL
database engine running on `host'.  `mysql_connect()' must complete
successfully before you can execute any of the other API functions,
with the exception of `mysql_get_client_info()'.

The meanings of the parameters are the same as for the corresponding
parameters for `mysql_real_connect()' with the difference that the
connection parameter may be `NULL'. In this case the C API allocates
memory for the connection structure automatically and frees it when you
call `mysql_close()'. The disadvantage of this approach is that you
can't retrieve an error message if the connection fails.  (To get error
information from `mysql_errno()' or `mysql_error()', you must provide a
valid `MYSQL' pointer.)

Return Values
.............

Same as for `mysql_real_connect()'.

Errors
......

Same as for `mysql_real_connect()'.


File: mysql.info,  Node: mysql_change_user,  Next: mysql_character_set_name,  Prev: mysql_connect,  Up: C API functions

`mysql_change_user()'
.....................

`my_bool mysql_change_user(MYSQL *mysql, const char *user, const char
*password, const char *db)'

Description
...........

Changes the user and causes the database specified by `db' to become
the default (current) database on the connection specified by `mysql'.
In subsequent queries, this database is the default for table
references that do not include an explicit database specifier.

This function was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.3.

`mysql_change_user()' fails unless the connected user can be
authenticated or if he doesn't have permission to use the database.  In
this case the user and database are not changed

The `db' parameter may be set to `NULL' if you don't want to have a
default database.

Return values
.............

Zero for success.  Non-zero if an error occurred.

Errors
......

The same that you can get from `mysql_real_connect()'.

`CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC'
     Commands were executed in an improper order.

`CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR'
     The MySQL server has gone away.

`CR_SERVER_LOST'
     The connection to the server was lost during the query.

`CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR'
     An unknown error occurred.

`ER_UNKNOWN_COM_ERROR'
     The MySQL server doesn't implement this command (probably an old
     server)

`ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR'
     The user or password was wrong.

`ER_BAD_DB_ERROR'
     The database didn't exist.

`ER_DBACCESS_DENIED_ERROR'
     The user did not have access rights to the database.

`ER_WRONG_DB_NAME'
     The database name was too long.

`mysql_eof()'
.............

`my_bool mysql_eof(MYSQL_RES *result)'

Description
...........

This function is deprecated.  `mysql_errno()' or `mysql_error()' may be
used instead.

`mysql_eof()' determines whether or not the last row of a result set
has been read.

If you acquire a result set from a successful call to
`mysql_store_result()', the client receives the entire set in one
operation.  In this case, a `NULL' return from `mysql_fetch_row()'
always means the end of the result set has been reached and it is
unnecessary to call `mysql_eof()'.

On the other hand, if you use `mysql_use_result()' to initiate a result
set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by
one as you call `mysql_fetch_row()' repeatedly.  Because an error may
occur on the connection during this process, a `NULL' return value from
`mysql_fetch_row()' does not necessarily mean the end of the result set
was reached normally.  In this case, you can use `mysql_eof()' to
determine what happened.  `mysql_eof()' returns a non-zero value if the
end of the result set was reached and zero if an error occurred.

Historically, `mysql_eof()' predates the standard MySQL error functions
`mysql_errno()' and `mysql_error()'.  Because those error functions
provide the same information, their use is preferred over
`mysql_eof()', which is now deprecated.  (In fact, they provide more
information, because `mysql_eof()' returns only a boolean value whereas
the error functions indicate a reason for the error when one occurs.)

Return Values
.............

Zero if no error occurred. Non-zero if the end of the result set has
been reached.

Errors
......

None.

Example
.......

The following example shows how you might use `mysql_eof()':

     mysql_query(&mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
     result = mysql_use_result(&mysql);
     while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
     {
         // do something with data
     }
     if(!mysql_eof(result))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
     }

However, you can achieve the same effect with the standard MySQL error
functions:

     mysql_query(&mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
     result = mysql_use_result(&mysql);
     while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
     {
         // do something with data
     }
     if(mysql_errno(&mysql))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
     }

`mysql_errno()'
...............

`unsigned int mysql_errno(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

For the connection specified by `mysql', `mysql_errno()' returns the
error code for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  A return value of zero means that no error occurred. Client
error message numbers are listed in the MySQL `errmsg.h' header file.
Server error message numbers are listed in `mysqld_error.h'. In the
MySQL source distribution you can find a complete list of error
messages and error numbers in the file `Docs/mysqld_error.txt'.

Return Values
.............

An error code value. Zero if no error occurred.

Errors

`mysql_error()'
...............

`char *mysql_error(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

For the connection specified by `mysql', `mysql_error()' returns the
error message for the most recently invoked API function that can
succeed or fail.  An empty string (`""') is returned if no error
occurred.  This means the following two tests are equivalent:

     if(mysql_errno(&mysql))
     {
         // an error occurred
     }
     
     if(mysql_error(&mysql)[0] != '\0')
     {
         // an error occurred
     }

The language of the client error messages may be changed by recompiling
the MySQL client library. Currently you can choose error messages in
several different languages.  *Note Languages::.

Return Values
.............

A character string that describes the error.  An empty string if no
error occurred.

Errors
......

None.

escape the string according to the current character set while
`mysql_escape_string()' does not respect the current charset setting.

`mysql_fetch_field()'
.....................

`MYSQL_FIELD *mysql_fetch_field(MYSQL_RES *result)'

Description
...........

Returns the definition of one column of a result set as a `MYSQL_FIELD'
structure. Call this function repeatedly to retrieve information about
all columns in the result set.  `mysql_fetch_field()' returns `NULL'
when no more fields are left.

`mysql_fetch_field()' is reset to return information about the first
field each time you execute a new `SELECT' query.  The field returned by
`mysql_fetch_field()' is also affected by calls to `mysql_field_seek()'.

If you've called `mysql_query()' to perform a `SELECT' on a table but
have not called `mysql_store_result()', MySQL returns the default blob
length (8K bytes) if you call `mysql_fetch_field()' to ask for the
length of a `BLOB' field.  (The 8K size is chosen because MySQL doesn't
know the maximum length for the `BLOB'. This should be made
configurable sometime.) Once you've retrieved the result set,
`field->max_length' contains the length of the largest value for this
column in the specific query.

Return Values
.............

The `MYSQL_FIELD' structure for the current column. `NULL' if no
columns are left.

Errors
......

None.

Example
.......

     MYSQL_FIELD *field;

that column's field definition as a `MYSQL_FIELD' structure. You may use
this function to retrieve the definition for an arbitrary column.  The
value of `fieldnr' should be in the range from 0 to

`mysql_fetch_lengths()'
.......................

`unsigned long *mysql_fetch_lengths(MYSQL_RES *result)'

Description
...........

Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row within a result
set.  If you plan to copy field values, this length information is also
useful for optimization, because you can avoid calling `strlen()'.  In
addition, if the result set contains binary data, you _must_ use this
function to determine the size of the data, because `strlen()' returns
incorrect results for any field containing null characters.

The length for empty columns and for columns containing `NULL' values is
zero.  To see how to distinguish these two cases, see the description
for `mysql_fetch_row()'.

Return Values
.............

An array of unsigned long integers representing the size of each column
(not including any terminating null characters).  `NULL' if an error
occurred.

Errors
......

`mysql_fetch_lengths()' is valid only for the current row of the result
set.  It returns `NULL' if you call it before calling
`mysql_fetch_row()' or after retrieving all rows in the result.

Example
.......

     MYSQL_ROW row;
     unsigned long *lengths;
     unsigned int num_fields;
     unsigned int i;
     
     row = mysql_fetch_row(result);

`mysql_fetch_row()'
...................

`MYSQL_ROW mysql_fetch_row(MYSQL_RES *result)'

Description
...........

Retrieves the next row of a result set. When used after
`mysql_store_result()', `mysql_fetch_row()' returns `NULL' when there
are no more rows to retrieve.  When used after `mysql_use_result()',
`mysql_fetch_row()' returns `NULL' when there are no more rows to
retrieve or if an error occurred.

The number of values in the row is given by `mysql_num_fields(result)'.
If `row' holds the return value from a call to `mysql_fetch_row()',
pointers to the values are accessed as `row[0]' to
`row[mysql_num_fields(result)-1]'.  `NULL' values in the row are
indicated by `NULL' pointers.

The lengths of the field values in the row may be obtained by calling
`mysql_fetch_lengths()'.  Empty fields and fields containing `NULL'
both have length 0; you can distinguish these by checking the pointer
for the field value.  If the pointer is `NULL', the field is `NULL';
otherwise the field is empty.

Return Values
.............

A `MYSQL_ROW' structure for the next row.  `NULL' if there are no more
rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

Errors
......

`CR_SERVER_LOST'
     The connection to the server was lost during the query.

`CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR'
     An unknown error occurred.

Example
.......

     MYSQL_ROW row;

     unsigned int i;
     
     num_fields = mysql_num_fields(result);
     while ((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
     {
        unsigned long *lengths;
        lengths = mysql_fetch_lengths(result);
        for(i = 0; i < num_fields; i++)
        {
            printf("[%.*s] ", (int) lengths[i], row[i] ? row[i] : "NULL");
        }

`mysql_field_count()'
.....................

`unsigned int mysql_field_count(MYSQL *mysql)'

If you are using a version of MySQL earlier than Version 3.22.24, you
should use `unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL *mysql)' instead.

Description
...........

Returns the number of columns for the most recent query on the
connection.

The normal use of this function is when `mysql_store_result()' returned
`NULL' (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you
can call `mysql_field_count()' to determine whether or not
`mysql_store_result()' should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether
or not the query was a `SELECT' (or `SELECT'-like) statement.  The
example shown below illustrates how this may be done.

*Note `NULL mysql_store_result()': NULL mysql_store_result.

Return Values
.............

An unsigned integer representing the number of fields in a result set.

Errors
......

None.

Example
.......

     MYSQL_RES *result;
     unsigned int num_fields;
     unsigned int num_rows;
     
     if (mysql_query(&mysql,query_string))
     {
         // error
     }
     else // query succeeded, process any data returned by it
     {
         result = mysql_store_result(&mysql);
         if (result)  // there are rows
         {
             num_fields = mysql_num_fields(result);
             // retrieve rows, then call mysql_free_result(result)
         }
         else  // mysql_store_result() returned nothing; should it have?
         {
             if(mysql_field_count(&mysql) == 0)
             {
                 // query does not return data
                 // (it was not a SELECT)
                 num_rows = mysql_affected_rows(&mysql);
             }
             else // mysql_store_result() should have returned data
             {
                 fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
             }
         }
     }

An alternative is to replace the `mysql_field_count(&mysql)' call with
`mysql_errno(&mysql)'.  In this case, you are checking directly for an
error from `mysql_store_result()' rather than inferring from the value
of `mysql_field_count()' whether or not the statement was a `SELECT'.

Note that `mysql_insert_id()' returns `0' if the previous query does
not generate an `AUTO_INCREMENT' value.  If you need to save the value
for later, be sure to call `mysql_insert_id()' immediately after the
query that generates the value.

`mysql_insert_id()' is updated after `INSERT' and `UPDATE' statements
that generate an `AUTO_INCREMENT' value or that set a column value to
`LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)'.  *Note Miscellaneous functions::.

Also note that the value of the SQL `LAST_INSERT_ID()' function always
contains the most recently generated `AUTO_INCREMENT' value, and is not
reset between queries because the value of that function is maintained
in the server.

Return Values
.............

The value of the `AUTO_INCREMENT' field that was updated by the previous
query.  Returns zero if there was no previous query on the connection
or if the query did not update an `AUTO_INCREMENT' value.

Errors
......

None.

match the simple regular expression specified by the `wild' parameter.
`wild' may contain the wild-card characters `%' or `_', or may be a
`NULL' pointer to match all fields.  Calling `mysql_list_fields()' is
similar to executing the query `SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name [LIKE wild]'.

Note that it's recommended that you use `SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name'
instead of `mysql_list_fields()'.

`mysql_num_fields()'
....................

`unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL_RES *result)'

or

`unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL *mysql)'

The second form doesn't work on MySQL Version 3.22.24 or newer.  To
pass a `MYSQL*' argument, you must use `unsigned int
mysql_field_count(MYSQL *mysql)' instead.

Description
...........

Returns the number of columns in a result set.

Note that you can get the number of columns either from a pointer to a
result set or to a connection handle.  You would use the connection
handle if `mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_use_result()' returned
`NULL' (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you can
call `mysql_field_count()' to determine whether or not
`mysql_store_result()' should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether
or not the query was a `SELECT' (or `SELECT'-like) statement.  The
example shown below illustrates how this may be done.

*Note `NULL mysql_store_result()': NULL mysql_store_result.

Return Values
.............

An unsigned integer representing the number of fields in a result set.

Errors
......

None.

Example
.......

     MYSQL_RES *result;
     unsigned int num_fields;
     unsigned int num_rows;
     
     if (mysql_query(&mysql,query_string))
     {
         // error
     }
     else // query succeeded, process any data returned by it
     {
         result = mysql_store_result(&mysql);
         if (result)  // there are rows
         {
             num_fields = mysql_num_fields(result);
             // retrieve rows, then call mysql_free_result(result)
         }
         else  // mysql_store_result() returned nothing; should it have?
         {
             if (mysql_errno(&mysql))
     	{
                fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
     	}
             else if (mysql_field_count(&mysql) == 0)
             {
                 // query does not return data
                 // (it was not a SELECT)
                 num_rows = mysql_affected_rows(&mysql);
             }
         }
     }

An alternative (if you KNOW that your query should have returned a
result set) is to replace the `mysql_errno(&mysql)' call with a check if
`mysql_field_count(&mysql)' is = 0.  This will only happen if something
went wrong.

`mysql_num_rows()'
..................

`my_ulonglong mysql_num_rows(MYSQL_RES *result)'

Description
...........

Returns the number of rows in the result set.

The use of `mysql_num_rows()' depends on whether you use
`mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_use_result()' to return the result
set.  If you use `mysql_store_result()', `mysql_num_rows()' may be
called immediately.  If you use `mysql_use_result()',
`mysql_num_rows()' will not return the correct value until all the rows
in the result set have been retrieved.

Return Values
.............

The number of rows in the result set.

Errors
......

None.

`mysql_options()'
.................

`int mysql_options(MYSQL *mysql, enum mysql_option option, const char
*arg)'

Description
...........

Can be used to set extra connect options and affect behavior for a
connection.  This function may be called multiple times to set several
options.

`mysql_options()' should be called after `mysql_init()' and before
`mysql_connect()' or `mysql_real_connect()'.

The `option' argument is the option that you want to set; the `arg'
argument is the value for the option. If the option is an integer, then
`arg' should point to the value of the integer.

Possible options values:

*Option*           *Argument type*    *Function*
`MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT'`unsigned int *'   Connect timeout in seconds.
`MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS'Not used           Use the compressed client/server
                                      protocol.
`MYSQL_OPT_NAMED_PIPE'Not used           Use named pipes to connect to a
                                      MySQL server on NT.
`MYSQL_INIT_COMMAND'`char *'           Command to execute when connecting
                                      to the MySQL server. Will
                                      automatically be re-executed when
                                      reconnecting.
`MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE'`char *'           Read options from the named option
                                      file instead of from `my.cnf'.
`MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP'`char *'           Read options from the named group
                                      from `my.cnf' or the file specified
                                      with `MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE'.

Note that the group `client' is always read if you use
`MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE' or `MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP'.

The specified group in the option file may contain the following
options:

`connect_timeout'      Connect timeout in seconds. On Linux this timeout
                       is also used for waiting for the first answer
                       from the server.
`compress'             Use the compressed client/server protocol.
`database'             Connect to this database if no database was
                       specified in the connect command.
`debug'                Debug options.
`host'                 Default host name.
`init-command'         Command to execute when connecting to MySQL
                       server. Will automatically be re-executed when
                       reconnecting.
`interactive-timeout'  Same as specifying `CLIENT_INTERACTIVE' to
                       `mysql_real_connect()'. *Note
                       mysql_real_connect::.
`password'             Default password.
`pipe'                 Use named pipes to connect to a MySQL server on
                       NT.
`port'                 Default port number.
`return-found-rows'    Tell `mysql_info()' to return found rows instead
                       of updated rows when using `UPDATE'.
`socket'               Default socket number.

`user'                 Default user.

Note that `timeout' has been replaced by `connect_timeout', but
`timeout' will still work for a while.

For more information about option files, see *Note Option files::.

Return Values
.............

Zero for success.  Non-zero if you used an unknown option.

Example
.......

     MYSQL mysql;
     
     mysql_init(&mysql);
     mysql_options(&mysql,MYSQL_OPT_COMPRESS,0);
     mysql_options(&mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"odbc");
     if (!mysql_real_connect(&mysql,"host","user","passwd","database",0,NULL,0))
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to database: Error: %s\n",
               mysql_error(&mysql));
     }

The above requests the client to use the compressed client/server
protocol and read the additional options from the `odbc' section in the
`my.cnf' file.

...........

Checks whether or not the connection to the server is working. If it
has gone down, an automatic reconnection is attempted.

This function can be used by clients that remain idle for a long while,
to check whether or not the server has closed the connection and
reconnect if necessary.

`mysql_query()'
...............

`int mysql_query(MYSQL *mysql, const char *query)'

Description
...........

Executes the SQL query pointed to by the null-terminated string `query'.
The query must consist of a single SQL statement.  You should not add a
terminating semicolon (`;') or `\g' to the statement.

`mysql_query()' cannot be used for queries that contain binary data; you
should use `mysql_real_query()' instead.  (Binary data may contain the
`\0' character, which `mysql_query()' interprets as the end of the
query string.)

If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you
can use `mysql_field_count()' to check for this.  *Note
`mysql_field_count': mysql_field_count.

Return Values
.............

Zero if the query was successful. Non-zero if an error occurred.

Errors
......

`CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC'
     Commands were executed in an improper order.

`CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR'

            const char *user, const char *passwd, const char *db,
                    unsigned int port, const char *unix_socket,
                  unsigned int client_flag)'

Description
...........

`mysql_real_connect()' attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL
database engine running on `host'.  `mysql_real_connect()' must
complete successfully before you can execute any of the other API
functions, with the exception of `mysql_get_client_info()'.

The parameters are specified as follows:

   * The first parameter should be the address of an existing `MYSQL'
     structure.  Before calling `mysql_real_connect()' you must call
     `mysql_init()' to initialize the `MYSQL' structure. You can change
     a lot of connect options with the `mysql_options()' call. *Note
     mysql_options::.

   * The value of `host' may be either a hostname or an IP address.  If
     `host' is `NULL' or the string `"localhost"', a connection to the
     local host is assumed. If the OS supports sockets (Unix) or named
     pipes (Windows), they are used instead of TCP/IP to connect to the
     server.

   * The `user' parameter contains the user's MySQL login ID.  If
     `user' is `NULL', the current user is assumed.  Under Unix, this is
     the current login name.  Under Windows ODBC, the current user name
     must be specified explicitly.  *Note ODBC administrator::.

   * The `passwd' parameter contains the password for `user'.  If
     `passwd' is `NULL', only entries in the `user' table for the user
     that have a blank (empty) password field will be checked for a
     match. This allows the database administrator to set up the MySQL
     privilege system in such a way that users get different privileges
     depending on whether or not they have specified a password.

     NOTE: Do not attempt to encrypt the password before calling
     `mysql_real_connect()'; password encryption is handled
     automatically by the client API.

   * `db' is the database name.  If `db' is not `NULL', the connection
     will set the default database to this value.

   * If `port' is not 0, the value will be used as the port number for
     the TCP/IP connection.  Note that the `host' parameter determines
     the type of the connection.

   * If `unix_socket' is not `NULL', the string specifies the socket or
     named pipe that should be used.  Note that the `host' parameter
     determines the type of the connection.

   * The value of `client_flag' is usually 0, but can be set to a
     combination of the following flags in very special circumstances:

     *Flag name*       *Flag meaning* `mysqld' to be more
                       ODBC-friendly.
     `CLIENT_COMPRESS' Use compression protocol.
     `CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS'Return the number of found (matched) rows, not
                       the number of affected rows.
     `CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE'Allow spaces after function names. Makes all
                       functions names reserved words.
     `CLIENT_INTERACTIVE'Allow `interactive_timeout' seconds (instead
                       of `wait_timeout' seconds) of inactivity
                       before closing the connection.
     `CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA'Don't allow the `db_name.tbl_name.col_name'
                       syntax.  This is for ODBC. It causes the
                       parser to generate an error if you use that
                       syntax, which is useful for trapping bugs in
                       some ODBC programs.
     `CLIENT_ODBC'     The client is an ODBC client. This changes
     `CLIENT_SSL'      Use SSL (encrypted protocol).

Return Values
.............

A `MYSQL*' connection handle if the connection was successful, `NULL'
if the connection was unsuccessful.  For a successful connection, the
return value is the same as the value of the first parameter.

Errors
......

`CR_CONN_HOST_ERROR'
     Failed to connect to the MySQL server.

`CR_CONNECTION_ERROR'
     Failed to connect to the local MySQL server.

`CR_IPSOCK_ERROR'
     Failed to create an IP socket.

`CR_OUT_OF_MEMORY'
     Out of memory.

`CR_SOCKET_CREATE_ERROR'
     Failed to create a Unix socket.

`CR_UNKNOWN_HOST'
     Failed to find the IP address for the hostname.

`CR_VERSION_ERROR'
     A protocol mismatch resulted from attempting to connect to a
     server with a client library that uses a different protocol
     version.  This can happen if you use a very old client library to
     connect to a new server that wasn't started with the
     `--old-protocol' option.

`CR_NAMEDPIPEOPEN_ERROR'
     Failed to create a named pipe on Windows.

`CR_NAMEDPIPEWAIT_ERROR'
     Failed to wait for a named pipe on Windows.

`CR_NAMEDPIPESETSTATE_ERROR'
     Failed to get a pipe handler on Windows.

`CR_SERVER_LOST'
     If `connect_timeout' > 0 and it took longer then `connect_timeout'
     seconds to connect to the server or if the server died while
     executing the `init-command'.

Example
.......

     MYSQL mysql;
     
     mysql_init(&mysql);
     mysql_options(&mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"your_prog_name");
     if (!mysql_real_connect(&mysql,"host","user","passwd","database",0,NULL,0))
     {
         fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to database: Error: %s\n",
               mysql_error(&mysql));
     }

By using `mysql_options()' the MySQL library will read the `[client]'
and `your_prog_name' sections in the `my.cnf' file which will ensure
that your program will work, even if someone has set up MySQL in some
non-standard way.

Note that upon connection, `mysql_real_connect()' sets the `reconnect'
flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of `1'. This flag
indicates, in the event that a query cannot be performed because of a
lost connection, to try reconnecting to the server before giving up.

`mysql_real_escape_string()'
............................

`unsigned int mysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to, const
char *from, unsigned int length)'

Description
...........

This function is used to create a legal SQL string that you can use in a
SQL statement. *Note String syntax::.

The string in `from' is encoded to an escaped SQL string, taking into
account the current character set of the connection. The result is
placed in `to' and a terminating null byte is appended.  Characters
encoded are `NUL' (ASCII 0), `\n', `\r', `\', `'', `"', and Control-Z
(*note Literals::).

The string pointed to by `from' must be `length' bytes long.  You must
allocate the `to' buffer to be at least `length*2+1' bytes long.  (In
the worse case, each character may need to be encoded as using two
bytes, and you need room for the terminating null byte.)  When
`mysql_escape_string()' returns, the contents of `to' will be a
null-terminated string.  The return value is the length of the encoded
string, not including the terminating null character.

Example
.......

     char query[1000],*end;
     
     end = strmov(query,"INSERT INTO test_table values(");
     *end++ = '\'';
     end += mysql_real_escape_string(&mysql, end,"What's this",11);
     *end++ = '\'';
     *end++ = ',';
     *end++ = '\'';
     end += mysql_real_escape_string(&mysql, end,"binary data: \0\r\n",16);
     *end++ = '\'';
     *end++ = ')';
     
     if (mysql_real_query(&mysql,query,(unsigned int) (end - query)))
     {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to insert row, Error: %s\n",
                mysql_error(&mysql));
     }

The `strmov()' function used in the example is included in the
`mysqlclient' library and works like `strcpy()' but returns a pointer
to the terminating null of the first parameter.

Return Values
.............

The length of the value placed into `to', not including the terminating
null character.

Errors
......

None.

`length' bytes long.  The query must consist of a single SQL statement.
You should not add a terminating semicolon (`;') or `\g' to the
statement.

You _must_ use `mysql_real_query()' rather than `mysql_query()' for
queries that contain binary data, because binary data may contain the
`\0' character.  In addition, `mysql_real_query()' is faster than
`mysql_query()' because it does not call `strlen()' on the query string.

If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you
can use `mysql_field_count()' to check for this.  *Note
`mysql_field_count': mysql_field_count.

`MYSQL_ROW_OFFSET mysql_row_seek(MYSQL_RES *result, MYSQL_ROW_OFFSET
offset)'

Description
...........

Sets the row cursor to an arbitrary row in a query result set.  This
requires that the result set structure contains the entire result of
the query, so `mysql_row_seek()' may be used in conjunction only with
`mysql_store_result()', not with `mysql_use_result()'.

The offset should be a value returned from a call to `mysql_row_tell()'
or to `mysql_row_seek()'.  This value is not simply a row number; if you
want to seek to a row within a result set using a row number, use
`mysql_data_seek()' instead.

Return Values

`mysql_store_result()'
......................

`MYSQL_RES *mysql_store_result(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

You must call `mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_use_result()' for every
query that successfully retrieves data (`SELECT', `SHOW', `DESCRIBE',
`EXPLAIN').

You don't have to call `mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_use_result()'
for other queries, but it will not do any harm or cause any notable
performance if you call `mysql_store_result()' in all cases.  You can
detect if the query didn't have a result set by checking if
`mysql_store_result()' returns 0 (more about this later one).

If you want to know if the query should return a result set or not, you
can use `mysql_field_count()' to check for this.  *Note
`mysql_field_count': mysql_field_count.

`mysql_store_result()' reads the entire result of a query to the client,
allocates a `MYSQL_RES' structure, and places the result into this
structure.

`mysql_store_results()' returns a null pointer if the query didn't
return a result set (if the query was, for example, an `INSERT'
statement).

`mysql_store_results()' also returns a null pointer if reading of the
result set failed. You can check if you got an error by checking if
`mysql_error()' doesn't return a null pointer, if `mysql_errno()'
returns <> 0, or if `mysql_field_count()' returns <> 0.

An empty result set is returned if there are no rows returned.  (An
empty result set differs from a null pointer as a return value.)

Once you have called `mysql_store_result()' and got a result back that
isn't a null pointer, you may call `mysql_num_rows()' to find out how
many rows are in the result set.

You can call `mysql_fetch_row()' to fetch rows from the result set, or
`mysql_row_seek()' and `mysql_row_tell()' to obtain or set the current
row position within the result set.

You must call `mysql_free_result()' once you are done with the result
set.

*Note `NULL mysql_store_result()': NULL mysql_store_result.

Return Values
.............

A `MYSQL_RES' result structure with the results. `NULL' if an error
occurred.

`unsigned long mysql_thread_id(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

Returns the thread ID of the current connection.  This value can be
used as an argument to `mysql_kill()' to kill the thread.

If the connection is lost and you reconnect with `mysql_ping()', the
thread ID will change.  This means you should not get the thread ID and
store it for later. You should get it when you need it.

`mysql_use_result()'
....................

`MYSQL_RES *mysql_use_result(MYSQL *mysql)'

Description
...........

You must call `mysql_store_result()' or `mysql_use_result()' for every
query that successfully retrieves data (`SELECT', `SHOW', `DESCRIBE',
`EXPLAIN').

`mysql_use_result()' initiates a result set retrieval but does not
actually read the result set into the client like `mysql_store_result()'
does.  Instead, each row must be retrieved individually by making calls
to `mysql_fetch_row()'.  This reads the result of a query directly from
the server without storing it in a temporary table or local buffer,
which is somewhat faster and uses much less memory than
`mysql_store_result()'.  The client will only allocate memory for the
current row and a communication buffer that may grow up to
`max_allowed_packet' bytes.

On the other hand, you shouldn't use `mysql_use_result()' if you are
doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side, or if the
output is sent to a screen on which the user may type a `^S' (stop
scroll).  This will tie up the server and prevent other threads from
updating any tables from which the data is being fetched.

When using `mysql_use_result()', you must execute `mysql_fetch_row()'
until a `NULL' value is returned, otherwise the unfetched rows will be
returned as part of the result set for your next query. The C API will
give the error `Commands out of sync; You can't run this command now'
if you forget to do this!

You may not use `mysql_data_seek()', `mysql_row_seek()',
`mysql_row_tell()', `mysql_num_rows()', or `mysql_affected_rows()' with
a result returned from `mysql_use_result()', nor may you issue other
queries until the `mysql_use_result()' has finished.  (However, after
you have fetched all the rows, `mysql_num_rows()' will accurately
return the number of rows fetched.)

You must call `mysql_free_result()' once you are done with the result
set.

Return Values
.............

A `MYSQL_RES' result structure. `NULL' if an error occurred.

Why Is It that After `mysql_query()' Returns Success, `mysql_store_result()' Sometimes Returns `NULL?'
......................................................................................................

It is possible for `mysql_store_result()' to return `NULL' following a
successful call to `mysql_query()'.  When this happens, it means one of
the following conditions occurred:

   * There was a `malloc()' failure (for example, if the result set was
     too large).

   * The data couldn't be read (an error occurred on the connection).

   * The query returned no data (for example, it was an `INSERT',
     `UPDATE', or `DELETE').

You can always check whether or not the statement should have produced a
non-empty result by calling `mysql_field_count()'.  If
`mysql_field_count()' returns zero, the result is empty and the last
query was a statement that does not return values (for example, an
`INSERT' or a `DELETE').  If `mysql_field_count()' returns a non-zero
value, the statement should have produced a non-empty result.  See the
description of the `mysql_field_count()' function for an example.

You can test for an error by calling `mysql_error()' or `mysql_errno()'.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Query results,  Next: Getting unique ID,  Prev: NULL mysql_store_result,  Up: C API problems

What Results Can I Get From a Query?
....................................

In addition to the result set returned by a query, you can also get the
following information:

   * `mysql_affected_rows()' returns the number of rows affected by the
     last query when doing an `INSERT', `UPDATE', or `DELETE'. An
     exception is that if `DELETE' is used without a `WHERE' clause, the
     table is re-created empty, which is much faster! In this case,
     `mysql_affected_rows()' returns zero for the number of records
     affected.

   * `mysql_num_rows()' returns the number of rows in a result set.
     With `mysql_store_result()', `mysql_num_rows()' may be called as
     soon as `mysql_store_result()' returns.  With `mysql_use_result()',
     `mysql_num_rows()' may be called only after you have fetched all
     the rows with `mysql_fetch_row()'.

   * `mysql_insert_id()' returns the ID generated by the last query
     that inserted a row into a table with an `AUTO_INCREMENT' index.
     *Note `mysql_insert_id()': mysql_insert_id.

   * Some queries (`LOAD DATA INFILE ...', `INSERT INTO ... SELECT
     ...', `UPDATE') return additional information.  The result is
     returned by `mysql_info()'.  See the description for `mysql_info()'
     for the format of the string that it returns.  `mysql_info()'
     returns a `NULL' pointer if there is no additional information.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Getting unique ID,  Next: C API linking problems,  Prev: Query results,  Up: C API problems

How Can I Get the Unique ID for the Last Inserted Row?
......................................................

If you insert a record in a table containing a column that has the
`AUTO_INCREMENT' attribute, you can get the most recently generated ID
by calling the `mysql_insert_id()' function.

You can also retrieve the ID by using the `LAST_INSERT_ID()' function in
a query string that you pass to `mysql_query()'.

You can check if an `AUTO_INCREMENT' index is used by executing the
following code. This also checks if the query was an `INSERT' with an
`AUTO_INCREMENT' index:

     if (mysql_error(&mysql)[0] == 0 &&
         mysql_num_fields(result) == 0 &&
         mysql_insert_id(&mysql) != 0)
     {
         used_id = mysql_insert_id(&mysql);
     }

The most recently generated ID is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It
will not even be changed if you update another `AUTO_INCREMENT' column
with a non-magic value (that is, a value that is not `NULL' and not
`0').

If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert
it into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

     INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
         VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
     INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
         VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table

Problems Linking with the C API
...............................

When linking with the C API, the following errors may occur on some
systems:

     gcc -g -o client test.o -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lsocket -lnsl
     
     Undefined        first referenced
      symbol          in file
     floor            /usr/local/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a(password.o)
     ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to client

If this happens on your system, you must include the math library by
adding `-lm' to the end of the compile/link line.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Building clients,  Next: Threaded clients,  Prev: C API problems,  Up: C

Building Client Programs
------------------------

If you compile MySQL clients that you've written yourself or that you
obtain from a third party, they must be linked using the `-lmysqlclient
-lz' option on the link command.  You may also need to specify a `-L'
option to tell the linker where to find the library.  For example, if
the library is installed in `/usr/local/mysql/lib', use
`-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz' on the link command.

For clients that use MySQL header files, you may need to specify a `-I'
option when you compile them (for example,
`-I/usr/local/mysql/include'), so the compiler can find the header
files.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Threaded clients,  Prev: Building clients,  Up: C

How to Make a Threaded Client
-----------------------------

The client library is almost thread safe. The biggest problem is that
the subroutines in `net.c' that read from sockets are not interrupt
safe.  This was done with the thought that you might want to have your
own alarm that can break a long read to a server.  If you install
interrupt handlers for the `SIGPIPE' interrupt, the socket handling
should be thread safe.

In the older binaries we distribute on our Web site, the client
libraries are not normally compiled with the thread-safe option (the
Windows binaries are by default compiled to be thread safe).  Newer
binary distributions should have both a normal and a thread-safe client
library.

To get a threaded client where you can interrupt the client from other
threads and set timeouts when talking with the MySQL server, you should
use the `-lmysys', `-lstring', and `-ldbug' libraries and the
`net_serv.o' code that the server uses.

If you don't need interrupts or timeouts, you can just compile a thread
safe client library `(mysqlclient_r)' and use this.  *Note MySQL C API:
C.  In this case you don't have to worry about the `net_serv.o' object
file or the other MySQL libraries.

When using a threaded client and you want to use timeouts and
interrupts, you can make great use of the routines in the `thr_alarm.c'
file.  If you are using routines from the `mysys' library, the only
thing you must remember is to call `my_init()' first! *Note C Thread
functions::.

All functions except `mysql_real_connect()' are by default thread safe.
The following notes describe how to compile a thread safe client
library and use it in a thread-safe manner.  (The notes below for
`mysql_real_connect()' actually apply to `mysql_connect()' as well, but
because `mysql_connect()' is deprecated, you should be using
`mysql_real_connect()' anyway.)

To make `mysql_real_connect()' thread safe, you must recompile the
client library with this command:

     shell> ./configure --enable-thread-safe-client

This will create a thread-safe client library `libmysqlclient_r'.
`--enable-thread-safe-client'.  This library is thread safe per
connection.  You can let two threads share the same connection as long
as you do the following:

   * Two threads can't send a query to the MySQL at the same time on
     the same connection.  In particular, you have to ensure that
     between a `mysql_query()' and `mysql_store_result()' no other
     thread is using the same connection.

   * Many threads can access different result sets that are retrieved
     with `mysql_store_result()'.

   * If you use `mysql_use_result', you have to ensure that no other
     thread is asking anything on the same connection until the result
     set is closed.  However, it really is best for threaded clients
     that share the same connection to use `mysql_use_result()'.

   * If you want to use multiple threads on the same connection, you
     must have a mutex lock around your `mysql_query()' and
     `mysql_store_result()' call combination.  Once
     `mysql_store_result()' is ready, the lock can be released and other
     threads may query the same connection.

   * If you program with POSIX threads, you can use
     `pthread_mutex_lock()' and `pthread_mutex_unlock()' to establish
     and release a mutex lock.

You need to know the following if you have a thread that is calling
MySQL functions, but that thread has not created the connection to the
MySQL database:

When you call `mysql_init()' or `mysql_connect()', MySQL will create a
thread specific variable for the thread that is used by the debug
library (among other things).

If you have in a thread call a MySQL function, before a thread has
called `mysql_init()' or `mysql_connect()', the thread will not have
the necessary thread specific variables in place and you are likely to
end up with a core dump sooner or later.

The get things to work smoothly you have to do the following:

  1. Call `my_init()' at the start of your program if it calls any
     other MySQL function before calling `mysql_real_connect()'.

  2. Call `my_thread_init()' in the thread handler before calling any
     MySQL function.

  3. In the thread, call `my_thread_end()' before calling
     `pthread_exit()'.  This will free the memory used by MySQL thread
     specific variables.

You may get some errors because of undefined symbols when linking your
client with `mysqlclient_r'. In most cases this is because you haven't
included the thread libraries on the link/compile line.

VC++) with Borland C++. You can do one of the following to avoid this
problem.

   * You can use the static MySQL libraries for Borland C++ that you

Adding New Functions to MySQL
=============================

There are two ways to add new functions to MySQL:

   * You can add the function through the user-definable function (UDF)
     interface.  User-definable functions are added and removed
     dynamically using the `CREATE FUNCTION' and `DROP FUNCTION'
     statements.  *Note `CREATE FUNCTION': CREATE FUNCTION.

   * You can add the function as a native (built in) MySQL function.
     Native functions are compiled into the `mysqld' server and become
     available on a permanent basis.

Each method has advantages and disadvantages:

   * If you write a user-definable function, you must install the
     object file in addition to the server itself.  If you compile your
     function into the server, you don't need to do that.

   * You can add UDFs to a binary MySQL distribution.  Native functions
     require you to modify a source distribution.

   * If you upgrade your MySQL distribution, you can continue to use
     your previously installed UDFs.  For native functions, you must
     repeat your modifications each time you upgrade.

Whichever method you use to add new functions, they may be used just
like native functions such as `ABS()' or `SOUNDEX()'.

* CREATE FUNCTION::             `CREATE FUNCTION/DROP FUNCTION' Syntax

`CREATE FUNCTION/DROP FUNCTION' Syntax
--------------------------------------

     CREATE [AGGREGATE] FUNCTION function_name RETURNS {STRING|REAL|INTEGER}
            SONAME shared_library_name
     
     DROP FUNCTION function_name

A user-definable function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like native (built in) MySQL functions such as
`ABS()' and `CONCAT()'.

`AGGREGATE' is a new option for MySQL Version 3.23.  An `AGGREGATE'
function works exactly like a native MySQL `GROUP' function like `SUM'
or `COUNT()'.

`CREATE FUNCTION' saves the function's name, type, and shared library
name in the `mysql.func' system table.  You must have the *insert* and
*delete* privileges for the `mysql' database to create and drop
functions.

All active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless
you start `mysqld' with the `--skip-grant-tables' option.  In this
case, UDF initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An
active function is one that has been loaded with `CREATE FUNCTION' and
not removed with `DROP FUNCTION'.)

For instructions on writing user-definable functions, see *Note Adding
functions::.  For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written
in C or C++, your operating system must support dynamic loading and you
must have compiled `mysqld' dynamically (not statically).

Adding a New User-definable Function
------------------------------------

* Menu:

* UDF calling sequences::       UDF calling sequences
* UDF arguments::               Argument processing
* UDF return values::           Return values and error handling
* UDF compiling::               Compiling and installing user-definable functions

For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or C++
and your operating system must support dynamic loading.  The MySQL
source distribution includes a file `sql/udf_example.cc' that defines 5
new functions.  Consult this file to see how UDF calling conventions
work.

For `mysqld' to be able to use UDF functions, you should configure MySQL
with `--with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic' The reason is that to on many
platforms (including Linux) you can load a dynamic library (with
`dlopen()') from a static linked program, which you would get if you
are using `--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static' If you want to use an UDF
that needs to access symbols from `mysqld' (like the `methaphone'
example in `sql/udf_example.cc' that uses `default_charset_info'), you
must link the program with `-rdynamic'.  (see `man dlopen').

For each function that you want to use in SQL statements, you should
define corresponding C (or C++) functions.  In the discussion below,
the name "xxx" is used for an example function name.  To distinquish
between SQL and C/C++ usage, `XXX()' (uppercase) indicates a SQL
function call, and `xxx()' (lowercase) indicates a C/C++ function call.

The C/C++ functions that you write to implement the interface for
`XXX()' are:

`xxx()' (required)
     The main function.  This is where the function result is computed.
     The correspondence between the SQL type and return type of your
     C/C++ function is shown below:

     *SQL type*    *C/C++ type*
     `STRING'      `char *'
     `INTEGER'     `long long'
     `REAL'        `double'

`xxx_init()' (optional)
     The initialization function for `xxx()'.  It can be used to:

        * Check the number of arguments to `XXX()'.

        * Check that the arguments are of a required type or,
          alternatively, tell MySQL to coerce arguments to the types
          you want when the main function is called.

        * Allocate any memory required by the main function.

        * Specify the maximum length of the result.

        * Specify (for `REAL' functions) the maximum number of decimals.

        * Specify whether or not the result can be `NULL'.

`xxx_deinit()' (optional)
     The deinitialization function for `xxx()'.  It should deallocate
     any memory allocated by the initialization function.

When a SQL statement invokes `XXX()', MySQL calls the initialization
function `xxx_init()' to let it perform any required setup, such as
argument checking or memory allocation.  If `xxx_init()' returns an
error, the SQL statement is aborted with an error message and the main
and deinitialization functions are not called.  Otherwise, the main
function `xxx()' is called once for each row.  After all rows have been
processed, the deinitialization function `xxx_deinit()' is called so it
can perform any required cleanup.

All functions must be thread safe (not just the main function, but the
initialization and deinitialization functions as well). This means that
you are not allowed to allocate any global or static variables that
change!  If you need memory, you should allocate it in `xxx_init()' and
free it in `xxx_deinit()'.

UDF Calling Sequences
.....................

The main function should be declared as shown below.  Note that the
return type and parameters differ, depending on whether you will
declare the SQL function `XXX()' to return `STRING', `INTEGER', or
`REAL' in the `CREATE FUNCTION' statement:

For `STRING' functions:

     char *xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                   char *result, unsigned long *length,
                   char *is_null, char *error);

For `INTEGER' functions:

     long long xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                   char *is_null, char *error);

For `REAL' functions:

     double xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                   char *is_null, char *error);

The initialization and deinitialization functions are declared like
this:

     my_bool xxx_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message);
     
     void xxx_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid);

The `initid' parameter is passed to all three functions.  It points to a
`UDF_INIT' structure that is used to communicate information between
functions.  The `UDF_INIT' structure members are listed below.  The
initialization function should fill in any members that it wishes to
change.  (To use the default for a member, leave it unchanged.):

`my_bool maybe_null'
     `xxx_init()' should set `maybe_null' to `1' if `xxx()' can return
     `NULL'.  The default value is `1' if any of the arguments are
     declared `maybe_null'.

`unsigned int decimals'
     Number of decimals.  The default value is the maximum number of
     decimals in the arguments passed to the main function.  (For
     example, if the function is passed `1.34', `1.345', and `1.3', the
     default would be 3, because `1.345' has 3 decimals.

`unsigned int max_length'
     The maximum length of the string result.  The default value
     differs depending on the result type of the function.  For string
     functions, the default is the length of the longest argument.  For
     integer functions, the default is 21 digits.  For real functions,
     the default is 13 plus the number of decimals indicated by
     `initid->decimals'.  (For numeric functions, the length includes
     any sign or decimal point characters.)

`char *ptr'
     A pointer that the function can use for its own purposes.  For
     example, functions can use `initid->ptr' to communicate allocated
     memory between functions.  In `xxx_init()', allocate the memory
     and assign it to this pointer:

          initid->ptr = allocated_memory;

     In `xxx()' and `xxx_deinit()', refer to `initid->ptr' to use or
     deallocate the memory.


File: mysql.info,  Node: UDF arguments,  Next: UDF return values,  Prev: UDF calling sequences,  Up: Adding UDF

Argument Processing
...................

The `args' parameter points to a `UDF_ARGS' structure that thas the
members listed below:

`unsigned int arg_count'
     The number of arguments.  Check this value in the initialization
     function if you want your function to be called with a particular
     number of arguments.  For example:

          if (args->arg_count != 2)
          {
              strcpy(message,"XXX() requires two arguments");
              return 1;
          }

`enum Item_result *arg_type'
     The types for each argument.  The possible type values are
     `STRING_RESULT', `INT_RESULT', and `REAL_RESULT'.

     To make sure that arguments are of a given type and return an
     error if they are not, check the `arg_type' array in the
     initialization function.  For example:

          if (args->arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT ||
              args->arg_type[1] != INT_RESULT)
          {
              strcpy(message,"XXX() requires a string and an integer");
              return 1;
          }

     As an alternative to requiring your function's arguments to be of
     particular types, you can use the initialization function to set
     the `arg_type' elements to the types you want.  This causes MySQL
     to coerce arguments to those types for each call to `xxx()'.  For
     example, to specify coercion of the first two arguments to string
     and integer, do this in `xxx_init()':

          args->arg_type[0] = STRING_RESULT;
          args->arg_type[1] = INT_RESULT;

`char **args'
     `args->args' communicates information to the initialization
     function about the general nature of the arguments your function
     was called with.  For a constant argument `i', `args->args[i]'
     points to the argument value.  (See below for instructions on how
     to access the value properly.)  For a non-constant argument,
     `args->args[i]' is `0'.  A constant argument is an expression that
     uses only constants, such as `3' or `4*7-2' or `SIN(3.14)'.  A
     non-constant argument is an expression that refers to values that
     may change from row to row, such as column names or functions that
     are called with non-constant arguments.

     For each invocation of the main function, `args->args' contains the
     actual arguments that are passed for the row currently being
     processed.

     Functions can refer to an argument `i' as follows:

        * An argument of type `STRING_RESULT' is given as a string
          pointer plus a length, to allow handling of binary data or
          data of arbitrary length.  The string contents are available
          as `args->args[i]' and the string length is
          `args->lengths[i]'.  You should not assume that strings are
          null-terminated.

        * For an argument of type `INT_RESULT', you must cast
          `args->args[i]' to a `long long' value:

               long long int_val;
               int_val = *((long long*) args->args[i]);

        * For an argument of type `REAL_RESULT', you must cast
          `args->args[i]' to a `double' value:

               double    real_val;
               real_val = *((double*) args->args[i]);

`unsigned long *lengths'
     For the initialization function, the `lengths' array indicates the
     maximum string length for each argument.  For each invocation of
     the main function, `lengths' contains the actual lengths of any
     string arguments that are passed for the row currently being
     processed.  For arguments of types `INT_RESULT' or `REAL_RESULT',
     `lengths' still contains the maximum length of the argument (as
     for the initialization function).

Return Values and Error Handling
................................

The initialization function should return `0' if no error occurred and
`1' otherwise.  If an error occurs, `xxx_init()' should store a
null-terminated error message in the `message' parameter.  The message
will be returned to the client.  The message buffer is
`MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE' characters long, but you should try to keep the
message to less than 80 characters so that it fits the width of a
standard terminal screen.

The return value of the main function `xxx()' is the function value, for
`long long' and `double' functions.  A string functions should return a
pointer to the result and store the length of the string in the
`length' arguments. `result' is a buffer at least 255 bytes long.  Set
these to the contents and length of the return value.  For example:

     memcpy(result, "result string", 13);
     *length = 13;

If your string functions that needs to return a string longer than 255
bytes, you must allocate the space for it with `malloc()' in your
`xxx_init()' function or your `xxx()' function and free it in your
`xxx_deinit()' function.  You can store the allocated memory in the
`ptr' slot in the `UDF_INIT' structure for reuse by future `xxx()'
calls.  *Note UDF calling sequences::.

To indicate a return value of `NULL' in the main function, set
`is_null' to `1':

     *is_null = 1;

To indicate an error return in the main function, set the `error'
parameter to `1':

     *error = 1;

If `xxx()' sets `*error' to `1' for any row, the function value is
`NULL' for the current row and for any subsequent rows processed by the
statement in which `XXX()' was invoked.  (`xxx()' will not even be
called for subsequent rows.) *NOTE:* In MySQL versions prior to
3.22.10, you should set both `*error' and `*is_null':

     *error = 1;
     *is_null = 1;

Compiling and Installing User-definable Functions
.................................................

Files implementing UDFs must be compiled and installed on the host
where the server runs.  This process is described below for the example
UDF file `udf_example.cc' that is included in the MySQL source
distribution.  This file contains the following functions:

   * `metaphon()' returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
     This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for
     English.

   * `myfunc_double()' returns the sum of the ASCII values of the
     characters in its arguments, divided by the sum of the length of
     its arguments.

   * `myfunc_int()' returns the sum of the length of its arguments.

   * `sequence([const int])' returns an sequence starting from the given
     number or 1 if no number has been given.

   * `lookup()' returns the IP number for a hostname.

   * `reverse_lookup()' returns the hostname for an IP number.  The
     function may be called with a string `"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"' or four
     numbers.

A dynamically loadable file should be compiled as a sharable object
file, using a command something like this:

     shell> gcc -shared -o udf_example.so myfunc.cc

You can easily find out the correct compiler options for your system by
running this command in the `sql' directory of your MySQL source tree:

     shell> make udf_example.o

You should run a compile command similar to the one that `make'
displays, except that you should remove the `-c' option near the end of
the line and add `-o udf_example.so' to the end of the line.  (On some
systems, you may need to leave  the `-c' on the command.)

Once you compile a shared object containing UDFs, you must install it
and tell MySQL about it.  Compiling a shared object from
`udf_example.cc' produces a file named something like `udf_example.so'
(the exact name may vary from platform to platform).  Copy this file to
some directory searched by `ld', such as `/usr/lib'.  On many systems,
you can set the `LD_LIBRARY' or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
to point at the directory where you have your UDF function files. The
`dlopen' manual page tells you which variable you should use on your
system. You should set this in `mysql.server' or `safe_mysqld' and
restart `mysqld'.

After the library is installed, notify `mysqld' about the new functions
with these commands:

     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";
     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_double RETURNS REAL SONAME "udf_example.so";
     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_int RETURNS INTEGER SONAME "udf_example.so";
     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";
     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION reverse_lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME "udf_example.so";

Functions can be deleted using `DROP FUNCTION':

     mysql> DROP FUNCTION metaphon;
     mysql> DROP FUNCTION myfunc_double;
     mysql> DROP FUNCTION myfunc_int;
     mysql> DROP FUNCTION lookup;
     mysql> DROP FUNCTION reverse_lookup;

The `CREATE FUNCTION' and `DROP FUNCTION' statements update the system
table `func' in the `mysql' database.  The function's name, type and
shared library name are saved in the table.  You must have the *insert*
and *delete* privileges for the `mysql' database to create and drop
functions.

You should not use `CREATE FUNCTION' to add a function that has already
been created.  If you need to reinstall a function, you should remove
it with `DROP FUNCTION' and then reinstall it with `CREATE FUNCTION'.
You would need to do this, for example, if you recompile a new version
of your function, so that `mysqld' gets the new version.  Otherwise the
server will continue to use the old version.

Active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless you
start `mysqld' with the `--skip-grant-tables' option.  In this case, UDF
initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An active
function is one that has been loaded with `CREATE FUNCTION' and not
removed with `DROP FUNCTION'.)


File: mysql.info,  Node: Adding native function,  Prev: Adding UDF,  Up: Adding functions

Adding a New Native Function
----------------------------

The procedure for adding a new native function is described below.  Note
that you cannot add native functions to a binary distribution because
the procedure involves modifying MySQL source code.  You must compile
MySQL yourself from a source distribution.  Also note that if you
migrate to another version of MySQL (for example, when a new version is
released), you will need to repeat the procedure with the new version.

To add a new native MySQL function, follow these steps:

  1. Add one line to `lex.h' that defines the function name in the
     `sql_functions[]' array.

  2. If the function prototype is simple (just takes zero, one, two or
     three arguments), you should in lex.h specify SYM(FUNC_ARG#)
     (where # is the number of arguments) as the second argument in the
     `sql_functions[]' array and add a function that creates a function
     object in `item_create.cc'.  Take a look at `"ABS"' and
     `create_funcs_abs()' for an example of this.

     If the function prototype is complicated (for example takes a
     variable number of arguments), you should add two lines to
     `sql_yacc.yy'. One indicates the preprocessor symbol that `yacc'
     should define (this should be added at the beginning of the file).
     Then define the function parameters and add an "item" with these
     parameters to the `simple_expr' parsing rule.  For an example,
     check all occurrences of `ATAN' in `sql_yacc.yy' to see how this
     is done.

  3. In `item_func.h', declare a class inheriting from `Item_num_func'
     or `Item_str_func', depending on whether your function returns a
     number or a string.

  4. In `item_func.cc', add one of the following declarations, depending
     on whether you are defining a numeric or string function:
          double   Item_func_newname::val()
          longlong Item_func_newname::val_int()
          String  *Item_func_newname::Str(String *str)

     If you inherit your object from any of the standard items (like
     `Item_num_func' you probably only have to define one of the above
     functions and let the parent object take care of the other
     functions.  For example, the `Item_str_func' class defines a
     `val()' function that executes `atof()' on the value returned by
     `::str()'.

  5. You should probably also define the following object function:
          void Item_func_newname::fix_length_and_dec()
     This function should at least calculate `max_length' based on the
     given arguments. `max_length' is the maximum number of characters
     the function may return.  This function should also set `maybe_null
     = 0' if the main function can't return a `NULL' value.  The
     function can check if any of the function arguments can return
     `NULL' by checking the arguments `maybe_null' variable. You can
     take a look at `Item_func_mod::fix_length_and_dec' for a typical
     example of how to do this.

All functions must be thread safe (In other words, don't use any global
or static variables in the functions without protecting them with
mutexes).

If you want to return `NULL', from `::val()', `::val_int()' or
`::str()' you should set `null_value' to 1 and return 0.

For `::str()' object functions, there are some additional
considerations to be aware of:

   * The `String *str' argument provides a string buffer that may be
     used to hold the result. (For more information about the `String'
     type, take a look at the `sql_string.h' file.)

   * The `::str()' function should return the string that holds the
     result or `(char*) 0' if the result is `NULL'.

   * All current string functions try to avoid allocating any memory
     unless absolutely necessary!

Adding New Procedures to MySQL
==============================

In MySQL, you can define a procedure in C++ that can access and modify
the data in a query before it is sent to the client.  The modification
can be done on row-by-row or `GROUP BY' level.

We have created an example procedure in MySQL Version 3.23 to show you
what can be done.

Additionally we recommend you to take a look at 'mylua', which you can
find in the Contrib directory. *Note Contrib::.  Which this you can use
the LUA language to load a procedure at runtime into `mysqld'.

Procedure Analyse
-----------------

`analyse([max elements,[max memory]])'

This procedure is defined in the `sql/sql_analyse.cc'.  This examines
the result from your query and returns an analysis of the results:

   * `max elements' (default 256) is the maximum number of distinct
     values `analyse' will notice per column.  This is used by
     `analyse' to check if the optimal column type should be of type
     `ENUM'.

   * `max memory' (default 8192) is the maximum memory `analyse' should
     allocate per column while trying to find all distinct values.

MySQL Threads
-------------

The MySQL server creates the following threads:

   * The TCP/IP connection thread handles all connection requests and
     creates a new dedicated thread to handle the authentication and
     and SQL query processing for each connection.

   * On Windows NT there is a named pipe handler thread that does the
     same work as the TCP/IP connection thread on named pipe connect
     requests.

   * The signal thread handles all signals.  This thread also normally
     handles alarms and calls `process_alarm()' to force timeouts on
     connections that have been idle too long.

   * If `mysqld' is compiled with `-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD', a dedicated
     thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some
     systems where there are problems with `sigwait()' or if one wants
     to use the `thr_alarm()' code in ones application without a
     dedicated signal handling thread.

   * If one uses the `--flush_time=#' option, a dedicated thread is
     created to flush all tables at the given interval.

   * Every connection has its own thread.

   * Every different table on which one uses `INSERT DELAYED' gets its
     own thread.

   * If you use `--master-host', a slave replication thread will be
     started to read and apply updates from the master.

`mysqladmin processlist' only shows the connection, `INSERT DELAYED',
and replication threads.

MySQL Test Suite
----------------

Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on
proprietary customer data and for that reason has not been publicly
available. The only publicly available part of our testing process
consisted of the `crash-me' test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the
`sql-bench' directory, and miscellaneous tests located in `tests'
directory. The lack of a standardized publicly available test suite has
made it difficult for our users, as well developers, to do regression
tests on the MySQL code. To address this problem, we have created a new
test system that is included in the source and binary distributions
starting in Version 3.23.29.

The current set of test cases doesn't test everything in MySQL, but it
should catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library
issues, and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal
is to have the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions
to our test suite.  You may especially want to contribute tests that
examine the functionality critical to your system, as this will ensure
that all future MySQL releases will work well with your applications.

Running the MySQL Test Suite
............................

The test system consist of a test language interpreter (`mysqltest'), a
shell script to run all tests(`mysql-test-run'), the actual test cases
written in a special test language, and their expected results.  To run
the test suite on your system after a build, type `make test' or
`mysql-test/mysql-test-run' from the source root.  If you have
installed a binary distribution, `cd' to the install root (eg.
`/usr/local/mysql'), and do `scripts/mysql-test-run'.  All tests should
succeed.  If not, you should try to find out why and report the problem
if this is a bug in MySQL.  *Note Reporting mysqltest bugs::.

If you have a copy of `mysqld' running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not
using ports `9306' and `9307'.  If one of those ports is taken, you
should edit `mysql-test-run' and change the values of the master and/or
slave port to one that is available.

You can run one individual test case with `mysql-test/mysql-test-run
test_name'.

If one test fails, you should test running `mysql-test-run' with the
`--force' option to check if any other tests fails.

Extending the MySQL Test Suite
..............................

You can use the `mysqltest' language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it - we
plan to do this shortly.  You can, however, look at our current test
cases and use them as an example.  The following points should help you
get started:

   * The tests are located in `mysql-test/t/*.test'

   * A test case consists of `;' terminated statements and is similar
     to the input of `mysql' command line client.  A statement by
     default is a query to be sent to MySQL server, unless it is
     recognized as internal command ( eg. `sleep' ).

   * All queries that produce results, e.g. `SELECT', `SHOW',
     `EXPLAIN', etc., must be preceded with `@/path/to/result/file'.
     The file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to
     generate the result file is to run `mysqltest -r <
     t/test-case-name.test' from `mysql-test' directory, and then edit
     the generated result files, if needed, to adjust them to the
     expected output.  In that case, be very careful about not adding
     or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only change
     the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make
     sure the fields are separated with a hard tab, and there is a hard
     tab at the end.  You may want to use `od -c' to make sure your
     text editor has not messed anything up during edit.  We, of
     course, hope that you will never have to edit the output of
     `mysqltest -r' as you only have to do it when you find a bug.

   * To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files
     in `mysql-test/r' directory and name them `test_name.result'.  If
     the test produces more than one result, you should use
     `test_name.a.result', `test_name.b.result', etc.

   * If a statement returns an error, you should on the line before the
     statement specify with the `--error error-number'.  The error
     number can be a list of possible error numbers separated with
     `',''.

   * If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the
     first line of the test file, put `source
     include/master-slave.inc;'.  To switch between master and slave,
     use `connection master;' and `connection slave;'.  If you need to
     do something on an alternate connection, you can do `connection
     master1;' for the master, and `connection slave1;' for the slave.

   * If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like
     this:
          let $1=1000;
          while ($1)
          {
           # do your queries here
           dec $1;
          }

   * To sleep between queries, use the `sleep' command. It supports
     fractions of a second, so you can do `sleep 1.3;', for example, to
     sleep 1.3 seconds.

   * To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put
     them in the command-line format in
     `mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt'. For the master, put them in
     `mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt'.

   * If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case
     to contribute, e-mail to <internals@lists.mysql.com>. As the list
     does not accept attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files
     to: <ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/Incoming>

Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite
......................................

If your MySQL version doesn't pass the test suite you should do the
following:

   * Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as
     possible of what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the
     `mysqlbug' script so that we can get information about your system
     and `MySQL' version. *Note Bug reports::.

   * Make sure to include the output of `mysql-test-run', as well as
     contents of all `.reject' files in `mysql-test/r' directory.

   * If a test in the test suite fails, check if the test fails also
     when run by its own:

          cd mysql-test
          mysql-test-run --local test-name

     If this fails, then you should configure MySQL with `--with-debug'
     and run `mysql-test-run' with the `--debug' option. If this also
     fails send the trace file `var/tmp/master.trace' to
     ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret so that we can examine
     it. Please remember to also include a full description of your
     system, the version of the mysqld binary and how you compiled it.

   * Try also to run `mysql-test-run' with the `--force' option to see
     if there is any other test that fails.

   * If you have compiled MySQL yourself, check our manual for how to
     compile MySQL on your platform or, preferable, use one of the
     binaries we have compiled for you at
     `http://www.mysql.com/downloads/'.  All our standard binaries
     should pass the test suite !

   * If you get an error, like `Result length mismatch' or `Result
     content mismatch' it means that the output of the test didn't match
     exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in MySQL or that
     your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
     circumstances.

     Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as
     the result file with the `.reject' extension.  If your test case is
     failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see
     how they are different, examine both with `od -c' and also check
     their lengths.

   * If a test fails totally, you should check the logs file in the
     `mysql-test/var/log' directory for hints of what went wrong.

   * If you have compiled MySQL with debugging you can try to debug this
     by running `mysql-test-run' with the `--gdb' and/or `--debug'
     options.  *Note Making trace files::.

     If you have not compiled MySQL for debugging you should probably
     do that.  Just specify the `--with-debug' options to `configure'!
     *Note Installing source::.

File: mysql.info,  Node: What is crashing,  Next: Common errors,  Prev: Problems,  Up: Problems

How to Determine What Is Causing Problems
=========================================

When you run into problems, the first thing you should do is to find out
which program / piece of equipment is causing problems:

   * If you have one of the following symptoms, then it is probably a
     hardware (like memory, motherboard, CPU, or hard disk) or kernel
     problem:
        - The keyboard doesn't work.  This can normally be checked by
          pressing Caps Lock. If the Caps Lock light doesn't change you
          have to replace your keyboard.  (Before doing this, you
          should try to reboot your computer and check all cables to
          the keyboard.)

        - The mouse pointer doesn't move.

        - The machine doesn't answer to a remote machine's pings.

        - Different, unrelated programs don't behave correctly.

        - If your system rebooted unexpectedly (a faulty user level
          program should NEVER be able to take down your system).

     In this case you should start by checking all your cables and run
     some diagnostic tool to check your hardware!  You should also
     check if there are any patches, updates, or service packs for your
     operating system that could likely solve your problems.  Check
     also that all your libraries (like glibc) are up to date.

     It's always good to use a machine with ECC memory to discover
     memory problems early!

   * If your keyboard is locked up, you may be able to fix this by
     logging into your machine from another machine and execute
     `kbd_mode -a' on it.

   * Please examine your system log file (/var/log/messages or similar)
     for reasons for your problems.  If you think the problem is in
     MySQL then you should also examine MySQL's log files. *Note Update
     log::.

   * If you don't think you have hardware problems, you should try to
     find out which program is causing problems.

     Try using `top', `ps', `taskmanager', or some similar program, to
     check which program is taking all CPU or is locking the machine.

   * Check with `top', `df', or a similar program if you are out of
     memory, disk space, open files, or some other critical resource.

   * If the problem is some runaway process, you can always try to kill
     it. If it doesn't want to die, there is probably a bug in the
     operating system.

If after you have examined all other possibilities and you have
concluded that it's the MySQL server or a MySQL client that is causing
the problem, it's time to do a bug report for our mailing list or our
support team.  In the bug report, try to give a very detailed
description of how the system is behaving and what you think is
happening. You should also state why you think it's MySQL that is
causing the problems.  Take into consideration all the situations in
this chapter. State any problems exactly how they appear when you
examine your system. Use the 'cut and paste' method for any output
and/or error messages from programs and/or log files!

Try to describe in detail which program is not working and all symptoms
you see!  We have in the past received many bug reports that just state
"the system doesn't work".  This doesn't provide us with any
information about what could be the problem.

If a program fails, it's always useful to know:

   * Has the program in question made a segmentation fault (core
     dumped)?

   * Is the program taking the whole CPU? Check with `top'. Let the
     program run for a while, it may be evaluating something heavy.

   * If it's the `mysqld' server that is causing problems, can you do
     `mysqladmin -u root ping' or `mysqladmin -u root processlist'?

   * What does a client program say (try with `mysql', for example)
     when you try to connect to the MySQL server?  Does the client jam?
     Do you get any output from the program?

When sending a bug report, you should of follow the outlines described
in this manual. *Note Asking questions::.

`Access denied' Error
---------------------

*Note Privileges::, and especially. *Note Access denied::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Gone away,  Next: Can not connect to server,  Prev: Error Access denied,  Up: Common errors

`MySQL server has gone away' Error
----------------------------------

This section also covers the related `Lost connection to server during
query' error.

The most common reason for the `MySQL server has gone away' error is
that the server timed out and closed the connection. By default, the
server closes the connection after 8 hours if nothing has happened. You
can change the time limit by setting the `wait_timeout' variable when
you start `mysqld'.

Another common reason to receive the `MySQL server has gone away' error
is because you have issued a "close" on your MySQL connection and then
tried to run a query on the closed connection.

You can check that the MySQL hasn't died by executing `mysqladmin
version' and examining the uptime.

If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again for the
client to do an automatic reconnection.

You normally can get the following error codes in this case (which one
you get is OS-dependent):

`CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR' The client couldn't send a question to the server.
`CR_SERVER_LOST'       The client didn't get an error when writing to
                       the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or
                       any answer) to the question.

You can also get these errors if you send a query to the server that is
incorrect or too large. If `mysqld' gets a packet that is too large or
out of order, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client
and closes the connection.  If you need big queries (for example, if
you are working with big `BLOB' columns), you can increase the query
limit by starting `mysqld' with the `-O max_allowed_packet=#' option
(default 1M). The extra memory is allocated on demand, so `mysqld' will
use more memory only when you issue a big query or when `mysqld' must
return a big result row!


File: mysql.info,  Node: Can not connect to server,  Next: Blocked host,  Prev: Gone away,  Up: Common errors

`Can't connect to [local] MySQL server' error
---------------------------------------------

A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the `mysqld' server in two
different ways: Unix sockets, which connect through a file in the file
system (default `/tmp/mysqld.sock') or TCP/IP, which connects through a
port number.  Unix sockets are faster than TCP/IP but can only be used
when connecting to a server on the same computer.  Unix sockets are
used if you don't specify a hostname or if you specify the special
hostname `localhost'.

On Windows you can connect only with TCP/IP if the `mysqld' server is
running on Win95/Win98. If mysqld is running on NT and started with
`enable-named-pipe', you can also connect with named pipes.  The name
of the named pipe is MySQL.  If you don't give a hostname when
connecting to `mysqld', a MySQL client will first try to connect to the
named pipe, and if this doesn't work it will connect to the TCP/IP
port.  You can force the use of named pipes on Windows by using `.' as
the hostname.

The error (2002) `Can't connect to ...' normally means that there isn't
a MySQL server running on the system or that you are using a wrong
socket file or TCP/IP port when trying to connect to the `mysqld'
server.

Start by checking (using `ps' or the task manager on Windows) that
there is a process running named `mysqld' on your server!  If there
isn't any `mysqld' process, you should start one. *Note Starting
server::.

If a `mysqld' process is running, you can check the server by trying
these different connections (the port number and socket pathname might
be different in your setup, of course):

     shell> mysqladmin version
     shell> mysqladmin variables
     shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
     shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
     shell> mysqladmin -h 'ip for your host' version
     shell> mysqladmin --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version

Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the
`hostname' command; these cause the output of `hostname' (that is, the
current hostname) to be substituted into the `mysqladmin' command.

Here are some reasons the `Can't connect to local MySQL server' error
might occur:

   * `mysqld' is not running.

   * You are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads.  If you are
     running on a system that doesn't have native threads, `mysqld'
     uses the MIT-pthreads package.  *Note Which OS::.  However, all
     MIT-pthreads versions doesn't support Unix sockets. On a system
     without sockets support you must always specify the hostname
     explicitly when connecting to the server. Try using this command
     to check the connection to the server:
          shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` version

   * Someone has removed the Unix socket that `mysqld' uses (default
     `/tmp/mysqld.sock').  You might have a `cron' job that removes the
     MySQL socket (for example, a job that removes old files from the
     `/tmp' directory).  You can always run `mysqladmin version' and
     check that the socket `mysqladmin' is trying to use really exists.
     The fix in this case is to change the `cron' job to not remove
     `mysqld.sock' or to place the socket somewhere else.  *Note
     Problems with mysql.sock::.

   * You have started the `mysqld' server with the
     `--socket=/path/to/socket' option.  If you change the socket
     pathname for the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients
     about the new path. You can do this by providing the socket path
     as an argument to the client. *Note Problems with mysql.sock::.

   * You are using Linux and one thread has died (core dumped).  In
     this case you must kill the other `mysqld' threads (for example,
     with the `mysql_zap' script before you can start a new MySQL
     server.  *Note Crashing::.

   * You may not have read and write privilege to either the directory
     that holds the socket file or privilege to the socket file itself.
     In this case you have to either change the privilege for the
     directory / file or restart `mysqld' so that it uses a directory
     that you can access.

If you get the error message `Can't connect to MySQL server on
some_hostname', you can try the following things to find out what the
problem is :

   * Check if the server is up by doing `telnet your-host-name
     tcp-ip-port-number' and press `RETURN' a couple of times.  If there
     is a MySQL server running on this port you should get a responses
     that includes the version number of the running MySQL server.  If
     you get an error like `telnet: Unable to connect to remote host:
     Connection refused', then there is no server running on the given
     port.

   * Try connecting to the `mysqld' daemon on the local machine and
     check the TCP/IP port that `mysqld' it's configured to use
     (variable `port') with `mysqladmin variables'.

   * Check that your `mysqld' server is not started with the
     `--skip-networking' option.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Blocked host,  Next: Too many connections,  Prev: Can not connect to server,  Up: Common errors

`Host '...' is blocked' Error
-----------------------------

If you get an error like this:

     Host 'hostname' is blocked because of many connection errors.
     Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'

this means that `mysqld' has gotten a lot (`max_connect_errors') of
connect requests from the host `'hostname'' that have been interrupted
in the middle. After `max_connect_errors' failed requests, `mysqld'
assumes that something is wrong (like an attack from a cracker), and
blocks the site from further connections until someone executes the
command `mysqladmin flush-hosts'.

By default, `mysqld' blocks a host after 10 connection errors.  You can
easily adjust this by starting the server like this:

     shell> safe_mysqld -O max_connect_errors=10000 &

Note that if you get this error message for a given host, you should
first check that there isn't anything wrong with TCP/IP connections
from that host.  If your TCP/IP connections aren't working, it won't do
you any good to increase the value of the `max_connect_errors' variable!


File: mysql.info,  Node: Too many connections,  Next: Non-transactional tables,  Prev: Blocked host,  Up: Common errors

`Too many connections' Error
----------------------------

If you get the error `Too many connections' when you try to connect to
MySQL, this means that there is already `max_connections' clients
connected to the `mysqld' server.

If you need more connections than the default (100), then you should
restart `mysqld' with a bigger value for the `max_connections' variable.

Note that `mysqld' actually allows (`max_connections'+1) clients to
connect.  The last connection is reserved for a user with the *process*
privilege.  By not giving this privilege to normal users (they
shouldn't need this), an administrator with this privilege can log in
and use `SHOW PROCESSLIST' to find out what could be wrong. *Note
SHOW::.

The maximum number of connects MySQL is depending on how good the
thread library is on a given platform. Linux or Solaris should be able
to support 500-1000 simultaneous connections, depending on how much RAM
you have and what your clients are doing.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Non-transactional tables,  Next: Out of memory,  Prev: Too many connections,  Up: Common errors

`Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back' Error
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get the error/warning: `Warning: Some non-transactional changed
tables couldn't be rolled back' when trying to do a `ROLLBACK', this
means that some of the tables you used in the transaction didn't
support transactions.  These non-transactional tables will not be
affected by the `ROLLBACK' statement.

The most typical case when this happens is when you have tried to create
a table of a type that is not supported by your `mysqld' binary.  If
`mysqld' doesn't support a table type (or if the table type is disabled
by a startup option) , it will instead create the table type with the
table type that is most resembles to the one you requested, probably
`MyISAM'.

You can check the table type for a table by doing:

`SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name''. *Note SHOW TABLE STATUS::.

You can check the extensions your `mysqld' binary supports by doing:

`show variables like 'have_%''. *Note SHOW VARIABLES::.

`Out of memory' Error
---------------------

If you issue a query and get something like the following error:

     mysql: Out of memory at line 42, 'malloc.c'
     mysql: needed 8136 byte (8k), memory in use: 12481367 bytes (12189k)
     ERROR 2008: MySQL client ran out of memory

note that the error refers to the MySQL client `mysql'. The reason for
this error is simply that the client does not have enough memory to
store the whole result.

To remedy the problem, first check that your query is correct. Is it
reasonable that it should return so many rows?  If so, you can use
`mysql --quick', which uses `mysql_use_result()' to retrieve the result
set.  This places less of a load on the client (but more on the server).


File: mysql.info,  Node: Packet too large,  Next: Communication errors,  Prev: Out of memory,  Up: Common errors

`Packet too large' Error
------------------------

When a MySQL client or the `mysqld' server gets a packet bigger than
`max_allowed_packet' bytes, it issues a `Packet too large' error and
closes the connection.

If you are using the `mysql' client, you may specify a bigger buffer by
starting the client with `mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=8M'.

If you are using other clients that do not allow you to specify the
maximum packet size (such as `DBI'), you need to set the packet size
when you start the server.  You cau use a command-line option to
`mysqld' to set `max_allowed_packet' to a larger size.  For example, if
you are expecting to store the full length of a `BLOB' into a table,
you'll need to start the server with the
`--set-variable=max_allowed_packet=16M' option.

You can also get strange problems with large packets if you are using
big blobs, but you haven't given `mysqld' access to enough memory to
handle the query.  If you suspect this is the case, try adding `ulimit
-d 256000' to the beginning of the `safe_mysqld' script and restart
`mysqld'.

Communication Errors / Aborted Connection
-----------------------------------------

Starting with `MySQL 3.23.40' you only get the `Aborted connection'
error of you start `mysqld' with `--warnings'.

If you find errors like the following in your error log.

     010301 14:38:23  Aborted connection 854 to db: 'users' user: 'josh'

*Note Error log::.

This means that something of the following has happened:

   * The client program did not call `mysql_close()' before exit.

   * The client had been sleeping more than `wait_timeout' or
     `interactive_timeout' without doing any requests. *Note SHOW
     VARIABLES::.

   * The client program ended abruptly in the middle of the transfer.

When the above happens, the server variable `Aborted_clients' is
incremented.

The server variable `Aborted_connects' is incremented when:

   * When a connection packet doesn't contain the right information.

   * When the user didn't have privileges to connect to a database.

   * When a user uses a wrong password.

   * When it takes more than `connect_timeout' seconds to get a connect
     package.

Note that the above could indicate that someone is trying to break into
your database!

*Note SHOW VARIABLES::.

Other reasons for problems with Aborted clients / Aborted connections.
   * Usage of duplex Ethernet protocol, both half and full with Linux.
     Many Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You should test for
     this bug by transferring a huge file via ftp between these two
     machines. If a transfer goes in burst-pause-burst-pause ... mode
     then you are experiencing a Linux duplex syndrome. The only
     solution to this problem is switching of both half and full
     duplexing on hubs and switches.

   * Some problem with the thread library that causes interrupts on
     reads.

   * Badly configured TCP/IP.

   * Faulty Ethernets or hubs or switches, cables ... This can be
     diagnosed properly only by replacing hardware.

   * `max_allowed_packet' is too small or queries require more memory
     than you have alloacated for `mysqld'. *Note Packet too large::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Full table,  Next: Cannot create,  Prev: Communication errors,  Up: Common errors

`The table is full' Error
-------------------------

This error occurs in older MySQL versions when an in-memory temporary
table becomes larger than `tmp_table_size' bytes. To avoid this
problem, you can use the `-O tmp_table_size=#' option to `mysqld' to
increase the temporary table size or use the SQL option
`SQL_BIG_TABLES' before you issue the problematic query. *Note `SET
OPTION': SET OPTION.

You can also start `mysqld' with the `--big-tables' option.  This is
exactly the same as using `SQL_BIG_TABLES' for all queries.

In MySQL Version 3.23, in-memory temporary tables will automatically be
converted to a disk-based `MyISAM' table after the table size gets
bigger than `tmp_table_size'.

`Can't create/write to file' Error
----------------------------------

If you get an error for some queries of type:

     Can't create/write to file '\\sqla3fe_0.ism'.

this means that MySQL can't create a temporary file for the result set
in the given temporary directory. (The above error is a typical error
message on Windows, and the Unix error message is similar.)  The fix is
to start `mysqld' with `--tmpdir=path' or to add to your option file:

     [mysqld]
     tmpdir=C:/temp

assuming that the `c:\\temp' directory exists. *Note Option files::.

Check also the error code that you get with `perror'. One reason may
also be a disk full error;

     shell> perror 28
     Error code  28:  No space left on device

`Commands out of sync' Error in Client
--------------------------------------

If you get `Commands out of sync; You can't run this command now' in
your client code, you are calling client functions in the wrong order!

This can happen, for example, if you are using `mysql_use_result()' and
try to execute a new query before you have called `mysql_free_result()'.
It can also happen if you try to execute two queries that return data
without a `mysql_use_result()' or `mysql_store_result()' in between.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Ignoring user,  Next: Cannot find table,  Prev: Commands out of sync,  Up: Common errors

`Ignoring user' Error
---------------------

If you get the following error:

`Found wrong password for user: 'some_user@some_host'; Ignoring user'

this means that when `mysqld' was started or when it reloaded the
permissions tables, it found an entry in the `user' table with an
invalid password.  As a result, the entry is simply ignored by the
permission system.

Possible causes of and fixes for this problem:

   * You may be running a new version of `mysqld' with an old `user'
     table.  You can check this by executing `mysqlshow mysql user' to
     see if the password field is shorter than 16 characters. If so,
     you can correct this condition by running the
     `scripts/add_long_password' script.

   * The user has an old password (8 characters long) and you didn't
     start `mysqld' with the `--old-protocol' option.  Update the user
     in the `user' table with a new password or restart `mysqld' with
     `--old-protocol'.

   * You have specified a password in the `user' table without using the
     `PASSWORD()' function.  Use `mysql' to update the user in the
     `user' table with a new password. Make sure to use the `PASSWORD()'
     function:

          mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD('your password')
                     where user='XXX';


File: mysql.info,  Node: Cannot find table,  Next: Cannot initialize character set,  Prev: Ignoring user,  Up: Common errors

`Table 'xxx' doesn't exist' Error
---------------------------------

If you get the error `Table 'xxx' doesn't exist' or `Can't find file:
'xxx' (errno: 2)', this means that no table exists in the current
database with the name `xxx'.

Note that as MySQL uses directories and files to store databases and
tables, the database and table names are *case sensitive*!  (On Windows
the databases and tables names are not case sensitive, but all
references to a given table within a query must use the same case!)

You can check which tables you have in the current database with `SHOW
TABLES'. *Note `SHOW': SHOW.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Cannot initialize character set,  Next: Not enough file handles,  Prev: Cannot find table,  Up: Common errors

`Cant' initialize character set xxx' error.
-------------------------------------------

If you get an error like:

     MySQL Connection Failed: Can't initialize character set xxx

This means one of the following things:

   * The character set is a multi-byte character set and you have not
     support for the character set in the client.

     In this case you need to recompile the client with
     `--with-charset=xxx' or with `--with-extra-charsets=xxx'.  *Note
     configure options::.

     All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
     `--with-extra-character-sets=complex' which will enable support for
     all multi-byte character sets. *Note Character sets::.

   * The character set is a simple character set which is not compiled
     into `mysqld' and the character set definition files is not in the
     place where the client expect to find them.

     In this case you need to:

        * Recompile the client with support for the character set.
          *Note configure options::.

        * Specify to the client where the character set definition
          files are. For many client you can do this with the
          `--character-sets-dir=path-to-charset-dir' option.

        * Copy the character definition files to the path where the
          client expect them to be.

File Not Found
--------------

If you get `ERROR '...' not found (errno: 23)', `Can't open file: ...
(errno: 24)', or any other error with `errno 23' or `errno 24' from
MySQL, it means that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for
MySQL.  You can use the `perror' utility to get a description of what
the error number means:

     shell> perror 23
     File table overflow
     shell> perror 24
     Too many open files
     shell> perror 11
     Resource temporarily unavailable

The problem here is that `mysqld' is trying to keep open too many files
simultaneously.  You can either tell `mysqld' not to open so many files
at once or increase the number of file descriptors available to
`mysqld'.

To tell `mysqld' to keep open fewer files at a time, you can make the
table cache smaller by using the `-O table_cache=32' option to
`safe_mysqld' (the default value is 64). Reducing the value of
`max_connections' will also reduce the number of open files (the
default value is 90).

To change the number of file descriptors available to `mysqld', you can
use the option `--open-files-limit=#' to `safe_mysqld' or `-O
open-files-limit=#' to `mysqld'. *Note SHOW VARIABLES::.  The easiest
way to do that is to add the option to your option file.  *Note Option
files::.  If you have an old `mysqld' version that doesn't support
this, you can edit the `safe_mysqld' script.  There is a commented-out
line `ulimit -n 256' in the script.  You can remove the `'#'' character
to uncomment this line, and change the number 256 to affect the number
of file descriptors available to `mysqld'.

`ulimit' (and `open-files-limit') can increase the number of file
descriptors, but only up to the limit imposed by the operating system.
There is also a 'hard' limit that can only be overrided if you start
`safe_mysqld' or `mysqld' as root (Just remember that you need to also
use the `--user=..' option in this case).  If you need to increase the
OS limit on the number of file descriptors available to each process,
consult the documentation for your operating system.

Note that if you run the `tcsh' shell, `ulimit' will not work!  `tcsh'
will also report incorrect values when you ask for the current limits!
In this case you should start `safe_mysqld' with `sh'!

Problems When Linking with the MySQL Client Library
---------------------------------------------------

If you are linking your program and you get errors for unreferenced
symbols that start with `mysql_', like the following:

     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o: In function `main':
     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0xb): undefined reference to `mysql_init'
     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x31): undefined reference to `mysql_real_connect'
     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x57): undefined reference to `mysql_real_connect'
     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x69): undefined reference to `mysql_error'
     /tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x9a): undefined reference to `mysql_close'

you should be able to solve this by adding `-Lpath-to-the-mysql-library
-lmysqlclient' *LAST* on your link line.

If you get `undefined reference' errors for the `uncompress' or
`compress' function, add `-lz' *LAST* on your link line and try again!

If you get `undefined reference' errors for functions that should exist
on your system, like `connect', check the man page for the function in
question, for which libraries you should add to the link line!

If you get `undefined reference' errors for functions that don't exist
on your system, like the following:

     mf_format.o(.text+0x201): undefined reference to `__lxstat'

it usually means that your library is compiled on a system that is not
100 % compatible with yours.  In this case you should download the
latest MySQL source distribution and compile this yourself.  *Note
Installing source::.

If you are trying to run a program and you then get errors for
unreferenced symbols that start with `mysql_' or that the `mysqlclient'
library can't be found, this means that your system can't find the
share `libmysqlclient.so' library.

The fix for this is to tell your system to search after shared
libraries where the library is located by one of the following methods:

   * Add the path to the directory where you have `libmysqlclient.so'
     the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.

   * Add the path to the directory where you have `libmysqlclient.so'
     the `LD_LIBRARY' environment variable.

   * Copy `libmysqlclient.so' to some place that is searched by your
     system, like `/lib', and update the shared library information by
     executing `ldconfig'.

Another way to solve this problem is to link your program statically,
with `-static', or by removing the dynamic MySQL libraries before
linking your code. In the second case you should be sure that no other
programs are using the dynamic libraries!

How to Run MySQL As a Normal User
---------------------------------

The MySQL server `mysqld' can be started and run by any user.  In order
to change `mysqld' to run as a Unix user `user_name', you must do the
following:

  1. Stop the server if it's running (use `mysqladmin shutdown').

  2. Change the database directories and files so that `user_name' has
     privileges to read and write files in them (you may need to do
     this as the Unix `root' user):

          shell> chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir

     If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are
     symlinks, you'll also need to follow those links and change the
     directories and files they point to.  `chown -R' may not follow
     symlinks for you.

  3. Start the server as user `user_name', or, if you are using MySQL
     Version 3.22 or later, start `mysqld' as the Unix `root' user and
     use the `--user=user_name' option.  `mysqld' will switch to run as
     the Unix user `user_name' before accepting any connections.

  4. To start the server as the given user name automatically at system
     startup time, add a `user' line that specifies the user name to
     the `[mysqld]' group of the `/etc/my.cnf' option file or the
     `my.cnf' option file in the server's data directory. For example:

          [mysqld]
          user=user_name

At this point, your `mysqld' process should be running fine and dandy as
the Unix user `user_name'. One thing hasn't changed, though: the
contents of the permissions tables. By default (right after running the
permissions table install script `mysql_install_db'), the MySQL user
`root' is the only user with permission to access the `mysql' database
or to create or drop databases.  Unless you have changed those
permissions, they still hold. This shouldn't stop you from accessing
MySQL as the MySQL `root' user when you're logged in as a Unix user
other than `root'; just specify the `-u root' option to the client
program.

Note that accessing MySQL as `root', by supplying `-u root' on the
command line, has _nothing_ to do with MySQL running as the Unix `root'
user, or, indeed, as another Unix user. The access permissions and user
names of MySQL are completely separate from Unix user names. The only
connection with Unix user names is that if you don't provide a `-u'
option when you invoke a client program, the client will try to connect
using your Unix login name as your MySQL user name.

If your Unix box itself isn't secured, you should probably at least put
a password on the MySQL `root' users in the access tables.  Otherwise,
any user with an account on that machine can run `mysql -u root
db_name' and do whatever he likes.

Problems with File Permissions
------------------------------

If you have problems with file permissions, for example, if `mysql'
issues the following error message when you create a table:

     ERROR: Can't find file: 'path/with/filename.frm' (Errcode: 13)

then the environment variable `UMASK' might be set incorrectly when
`mysqld' starts up.  The default umask value is `0660'. You can change
this behavior by starting `safe_mysqld' as follows:

     shell> UMASK=384  # = 600 in octal
     shell> export UMASK
     shell> /path/to/safe_mysqld &

By default MySQL will create database and `RAID' directories with
permission type 0700.  You can modify this behavior by setting the
`UMASK_DIR' variable. If you set this, new directories are created with
the combined `UMASK' and `UMASK_DIR'. For example, if you want to give
group access to all new directories, you can do:

     shell> UMASK_DIR=504  # = 770 in octal
     shell> export UMASK_DIR
     shell> /path/to/safe_mysqld &

In MySQL Version 3.23.25 and above, MySQL assumes that the value for
`UMASK' and `UMASK_DIR' is in octal if it starts with a zero.

What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing
----------------------------------

All MySQL versions are tested on many platforms before they are
released.  This doesn't mean that there aren't any bugs in MySQL, but
it means if there are bugs, they are very few and can be hard to find.
If you have a problem, it will always help if you try to find out
exactly what crashes your system, as you will have a much better chance
of getting this fixed quickly.

First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that the
`mysqld' daemon dies or whether your problem has to do with your
client.  You can check how long your `mysqld' server has been up by
executing `mysqladmin version'.  If `mysqld' has died, you may find the
reason for this in the file `mysql-data-directory/`hostname`.err'.
*Note Error log::.

Many crashes of MySQL are caused by corrupted index / data files.
MySQL will update the data on disk, with the `write()' system call,
after every SQL statement and before the client is notified about the
result. (This is not true if you are running with `delayed_key_writes',
in which case only the data is written.)  This means that the data is
safe even if `mysqld' crashes, as the OS will ensure that the not
flushed data is written to disk.  You can force MySQL to sync
everything to disk after every SQL command by starting `mysqld' with
`--flush'.

The above means that normally you shouldn't get corrupted tables unless:

   * Someone/something killed `mysqld' or the machine in the middle of
     an update.

   * You have found a bug in `mysqld' that caused it to die in the
     middle of an update.

   * Someone is manipulating the data/index files outside of *mysqld*
     without locking the table properly.

   * If you are running many `mysqld' servers on the same data on a
     system that doesn't support good file system locks (normally
     handled by the `lockd' daemon ) or if you are running multiple
     servers with `--skip-locking'

   * You have a crashed index/data file that contains very wrong data
     that got `mysqld' confused.

   * You have found a bug in the data storage code. This isn't that
     likely, but it's at least possible.  In this case you can try to
     change the file type to another database handler by using `ALTER
     TABLE' on a repaired copy of the table!

Because it is very difficult to know why something is crashing, first
try to check whether or not things that work for others crash for you.
Please try the following things:

   * Take down the `mysqld' daemon with `mysqladmin shutdown', run
     `myisamchk --silent --force */*.MYI' on all tables, and restart the
     `mysqld' daemon.  This will ensure that you are running from a
     clean state.  *Note MySQL Database Administration::.

   * Use `mysqld --log' and try to determine from the information in
     the log whether or not some specific query kills the server. About
     95% of all bugs are related to a particular query!  Normally this
     is one of the last queries in the log file just before MySQL
     restarted. *Note Query log::.  If you can repeatadly kill MySQL
     with one of the queries, even when you have checked all tables
     just before doing the query, then you have been able to locate the
     bug and should do a bug report for this!  *Note Bug reports::.

   * Try to make a test case that we can use to reproduce the problem.
     *Note Reproduceable test case::.

   * Try running the included mysql-test test and the MySQL benchmarks.
     *Note MySQL test suite::.  They should test MySQL rather well.
     You can also add code that to the benchmarks to simulates your
     application!  The benchmarks can be found in the `bench' directory
     in the source distribution or, for a binary distribution, in the
     `sql-bench' directory under your MySQL installation directory.

   * Try `fork_test.pl' and `fork2_test.pl'.

   * If you configure MySQL for debugging, it will be much easier to
     gather information about possible errors if something goes wrong.
     Reconfigure MySQL with the `--with-debug' option or
     `--with-debug=full' to `configure' and then recompile.  *Note
     Debugging server::.

   * Configuring MySQL for debugging causes a safe memory allocator to
     be included that can find some errors. It also provides a lot of
     output about what is happening.

   * Have you applied the latest patches for your operating system?

   * Use the `--skip-locking' option to `mysqld'.  On some systems, the
     `lockd' lock manager does not work properly; the `--skip-locking'
     option tells `mysqld' not to use external locking.  (This means
     that you cannot run 2 `mysqld' servers on the same data and that
     you must be careful if you use `myisamchk', but it may be
     instructive to try the option as a test.)

   * Have you tried `mysqladmin -u root processlist' when `mysqld'
     appears to be running but not responding?  Sometimes `mysqld' is
     not comatose even though you might think so.  The problem may be
     that all connections are in use, or there may be some internal
     lock problem.  `mysqladmin processlist' will usually be able to
     make a connection even in these cases, and can provide useful
     information about the current number of connections and their
     status.

   * Run the command `mysqladmin -i 5 status' or `mysqladmin -i 5 -r
     status' or in a separate window to produce statistics while you run
     your other queries.

   * Try the following:
       1. Start `mysqld' from `gdb' (or in another debugger).  *Note
          Using gdb on mysqld::.

       2. Run your test scripts.

       3. Print the backtrace and the local variables at the 3 lowest
          levels. In gdb you can do this with the following commands
          when `mysqld' has crashed inside gdb:

               backtrace
               info local
               up
               info local
               up
               info local

          With gdb you can also examine which threads exist with `info
          threads' and switch to a specific thread with `thread #',
          where `#' is the thread id.

   * Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to force MySQL
     to crash or misbehave.

   * Send a normal bug report. *Note Bug reports::. Be even more
     detailed than usual.  Because MySQL works for many people, it may
     be that the crash results from something that exists only on your
     computer (for example, an error that is related to your particular
     system libraries).

   * If you have a problem with tables with dynamic-length rows and you
     are not using `BLOB/TEXT' columns (but only `VARCHAR' columns), you
     can try to change all `VARCHAR' to `CHAR' with `ALTER TABLE'.
     This will force MySQL to use fixed-size rows.  Fixed-size rows
     take a little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
     corruption!

     The current dynamic row code has been in use at MySQL AB for at
     least 3 years without any problems, but by nature dynamic-length
     rows are more prone to errors, so it may be a good idea to try the
     above to see if it helps!

How to Reset a Forgotten Password
---------------------------------

If you have forgotten the `root' user password for MySQL, you can
restore it with the following procedure:

  1. Take down the `mysqld' server by sending a `kill' (not `kill -9')
     to the `mysqld' server.  The pid is stored in a `.pid' file, which
     is normally in the MySQL database directory:

          kill `cat /mysql-data-directory/hostname.pid`

     You must be either the Unix `root' user or the same user the server
     runs as to do this.

  2. Restart `mysqld' with the `--skip-grant-tables' option.

  3. Connect to the `mysqld' server with `mysql -h hostname mysql' and
     change the password with a `GRANT' command. *Note `GRANT': GRANT.
     You can also do this with `mysqladmin -h hostname -u user password
     'new password''

  4. Load the privilege tables with: `mysqladmin -h hostname
     flush-privileges' or with the SQL command `FLUSH PRIVILEGES'.

Note that after you started `mysqld' with `--skip-grant-tables', any
usage of `GRANT' commands will give you an `Unknown command' error
until you have executed `FLUSH PRIVILEGES'.

How MySQL Handles a Full Disk
-----------------------------

When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

   * It checks once every minute to see whether or not there is enough
     space to write the current row. If there is enough space, it
     continues as if nothing had happened.

   * Every 6 minutes it writes an entry to the log file warning about
     the disk full condition.

To alleviate the problem, you can take the following actions:

   * To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to insert all
     records.

   * To abort the thread, you must send a `mysqladmin kill' to the
     thread.  The thread will be aborted the next time it checks the
     disk (in 1 minute).

   * Note that other threads may be waiting for the table that caused
     the disk full condition.  If you have several "locked" threads,
     killing the one thread that is waiting on the disk-full condition
     will allow the other threads to continue.

Exceptions to the above behaveour is when you use `REPAIR' or
`OPTIMIZE' or when the indexes are created in a batch after an `LOAD
DATA INFILE' or after an `ALTER TABLE' statement.

All of the above commands may use big temporary files that left to
themself would cause big problems for the rest of the system.  If MySQL
gets disk full while doing any of the above operations, it will remove
the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed (except for
`ALTER TABLE', in which the old table will be left unchanged).


File: mysql.info,  Node: Temporary files,  Next: Problems with mysql.sock,  Prev: Full disk,  Up: Administration Issues

Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files
----------------------------------

MySQL uses the value of the `TMPDIR' environment variable as the
pathname of the directory in which to store temporary files.  If you
don't have `TMPDIR' set, MySQL uses the system default, which is
normally `/tmp' or `/usr/tmp'.  If the file system containing your
temporary file directory is too small, you should edit `safe_mysqld' to
set `TMPDIR' to point to a directory in a file system where you have
enough space!  You can also set the temporary directory using the
`--tmpdir' option to `mysqld'.

MySQL creates all temporary files as hidden files. This ensures that
the temporary files will be removed if `mysqld' is terminated.  The
disadvantage of using hidden files is that you will not see a big
temporary file that fills up the file system in which the temporary
file directory is located.

When sorting (`ORDER BY' or `GROUP BY'), MySQL normally uses one or two
temporary files. The maximum disk-space needed is:

     (length of what is sorted + sizeof(database pointer))
     * number of matched rows
     * 2

`sizeof(database pointer)' is usually 4, but may grow in the future for
really big tables.

For some `SELECT' queries, MySQL also creates temporary SQL tables.
These are not hidden and have names of the form `SQL_*'.

`ALTER TABLE' creates a temporary table in the same directory as the
original table.

How to Protect or change the MySQL socket file `/tmp/mysql.sock'
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you have problems with the fact that anyone can delete the MySQL
communication socket `/tmp/mysql.sock', you can, on most versions of
Unix, protect your `/tmp' file system by setting the `sticky' bit on
it.  Log in as `root' and do the following:

     shell> chmod +t /tmp

This will protect your `/tmp' file system so that files can be deleted
only by their owners or the superuser (`root').

You can check if the `sticky' bit is set by executing `ls -ld /tmp'.
If the last permission bit is `t', the bit is set.

You can change the place where MySQL uses / puts the socket file the
following ways:

   * Specify the path in a global or local option file.  For example,
     put in `/etc/my.cnf':

          [client]
          socket=path-for-socket-file
          
          [mysqld]
          socket=path-for-socket-file
     *Note Option files::.

   * Specifying this on the command line to `safe_mysqld' and most
     clients with the `--socket=path-for-socket-file' option.

   * Specify the path to the socket in the `MYSQL_UNIX_PORT' environment
     variable.

   * Defining the path with the `configure' option
     `--with-unix-socket-path=path-for-socket-file'. *Note configure
     options::.

You can test that the socket works with this command:

     shell> mysqladmin --socket=/path/to/socket version

Time Zone Problems
------------------

If you have a problem with `SELECT NOW()' returning values in GMT and
not your local time, you have to set the `TZ' environment variable to
your current time zone.  This should be done for the environment in
which the server runs, for example, in `safe_mysqld' or `mysql.server'.
*Note Environment variables::.

File: mysql.info,  Node: Case sensitivity,  Next: Using DATE,  Prev: Query Issues,  Up: Query Issues

Case Sensitivity in Searches
----------------------------

By default, MySQL searches are case-insensitive (although there are
some character sets that are never case insensitive, such as `czech').
That means that if you search with `col_name LIKE 'a%'', you will get
all column values that start with `A' or `a'. If you want to make this
search case-sensitive, use something like `INSTR(col_name, "A")=1' to
check a prefix. Or use `STRCMP(col_name, "A") = 0' if the column value
must be exactly `"A"'.

Simple comparison operations (`>=, >, = , < , <=', sorting and
grouping) are based on each character's "sort value". Characters with
the same sort value (like E, e and ) are treated as the same character!

In older MySQL versions `LIKE' comparisons where done on the uppercase
value of each character (E == e but E <> ).  In newer MySQL versions
`LIKE' works just like the other comparison operators.

If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion,
declare it as `BINARY'. *Note `CREATE TABLE': CREATE TABLE.

If you are using Chinese data in the so-called big5 encoding, you want
to make all character columns `BINARY'. This works because the sorting
order of big5 encoding characters is based on the order of ASCII codes.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Using DATE,  Next: Problems with NULL,  Prev: Case sensitivity,  Up: Query Issues

Problems Using `DATE' Columns
-----------------------------

The format of a `DATE' value is `'YYYY-MM-DD''. According to ANSI SQL,
no other format is allowed. You should use this format in `UPDATE'
expressions and in the WHERE clause of `SELECT' statements.  For
example:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date >= '1997-05-05';

As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a number if
the date is used in a numeric context (and vice versa). It is also smart
enough to allow a "relaxed" string form when updating and in a `WHERE'
clause that compares a date to a `TIMESTAMP', `DATE', or a `DATETIME'
column.  (Relaxed form means that any punctuation character may be used
as the separator between parts. For example, `'1998-08-15'' and
`'1998#08#15'' are equivalent.) MySQL can also convert a string
containing no separators (such as `'19980815''), provided it makes
sense as a date.

The special date `'0000-00-00'' can be stored and retrieved as
`'0000-00-00'.' When using a `'0000-00-00'' date through *MyODBC*, it
will automatically be converted to `NULL' in *MyODBC* Version 2.50.12
and above, because ODBC can't handle this kind of date.

Because MySQL performs the conversions described above, the following
statements work:

     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES (19970505);
     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');
     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997.05.05');
     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
     mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');
     
     mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= '1997-05-05';
     mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= 19970505;
     mysql> SELECT mod(idate,100) FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= 19970505;
     mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= '19970505';

However, the following will not work:

     mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE STRCMP(idate,'19970505')=0;

`STRCMP()' is a string function, so it converts `idate' to a string and
performs a string comparison.  It does not convert `'19970505'' to a
date and perform a date comparison.

Note that MySQL does no checking whether or not the date is correct.
If you store an incorrect date, such as `'1998-2-31'', the wrong date
will be stored. If the date cannot be converted to any reasonable
value, a `0' is stored in the `DATE' field.  This is mainly a speed
issue and we think it is up to the application to check the dates, and
not the server.

Problems with `NULL' Values
---------------------------

The concept of the `NULL' value is a common source of confusion for
newcomers to SQL, who often think that `NULL' is the same thing as an
empty string `'''.  This is not the case! For example, the following
statements are completely different:

     mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
     mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ("");

Both statements insert a value into the `phone' column, but the first
inserts a `NULL' value and the second inserts an empty string.  The
meaning of the first can be regarded as "phone number is not known" and
the meaning of the second can be regarded as "she has no phone".

In SQL, the `NULL' value is always false in comparison to any other
value, even `NULL'.  An expression that contains `NULL' always produces
a `NULL' value unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for the
operators and functions involved in the expression. All columns in the
following example return `NULL':

     mysql> SELECT NULL,1+NULL,CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);

If you want to search for column values that are `NULL', you cannot use
the `=NULL' test. The following statement returns no rows, because
`expr = NULL' is FALSE, for any expression:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;

To look for `NULL' values, you must use the `IS NULL' test.  The
following shows how to find the `NULL' phone number and the empty phone
number:

     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
     mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = "";

In MySQL, as in many other SQL servers, you can't index columns that
can have `NULL' values.  You must declare such columns `NOT NULL'.
Conversely, you cannot insert `NULL' into an indexed column.

When reading data with `LOAD DATA INFILE', empty columns are updated
with `'''. If you want a `NULL' value in a column, you should use `\N'
in the text file. The literal word `'NULL'' may also be used under some
circumstances.  *Note `LOAD DATA': LOAD DATA.

When using `ORDER BY', `NULL' values are presented first. If you sort
in descending order using `DESC', `NULL' values are presented last.
When using `GROUP BY', all `NULL' values are regarded as equal.

To help with `NULL' handling, you can use the `IS NULL' and `IS NOT
NULL' operators and the `IFNULL()' function.

For some column types, `NULL' values are handled specially.  If you
insert `NULL' into the first `TIMESTAMP' column of a table, the current
date and time is inserted.  If you insert `NULL' into an
`AUTO_INCREMENT' column, the next number in the sequence is inserted.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Problems with alias,  Next: Deleting from related tables,  Prev: Problems with NULL,  Up: Query Issues

Problems with `alias'
---------------------

You can use an alias to refer to a column in the `GROUP BY', `ORDER
BY', or in the `HAVING' part.  Aliases can also be used to give columns
better names:

     SELECT SQRT(a*b) as rt FROM table_name GROUP BY rt HAVING rt > 0;
     SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name GROUP BY id HAVING cnt > 0;
     SELECT id AS "Customer identity" FROM table_name;

Note that ANSI SQL doesn't allow you to refer to an alias in a `WHERE'
clause.  This is because when the `WHERE' code is executed the column
value may not yet be determined. For example, the following query is
*illegal*:

     SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name WHERE cnt > 0 GROUP BY id;

The `WHERE' statement is executed to determine which rows should be
included in the `GROUP BY' part while `HAVING' is used to decide which
rows from the result set should be used.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Deleting from related tables,  Next: No matching rows,  Prev: Problems with alias,  Up: Query Issues

Deleting Rows from Related Tables
---------------------------------

As MySQL doesn't support sub-selects or use of more than one table in
the `DELETE' statement, you should use the following approach to delete
rows from 2 related tables:

  1. `SELECT' the rows based on some `WHERE' condition in the main
     table.

  2. `DELETE' the rows in the main table based on the same condition.

  3. `DELETE FROM related_table WHERE related_column IN
     (selected_rows)'.

If the total number of characters in the query with `related_column' is
more than 1,048,576 (the default value of `max_allowed_packet', you
should split it into smaller parts and execute multiple `DELETE'
statements.  You will probably get the fastest `DELETE' by only
deleting 100-1000 `related_column' id's per query if the
`related_column' is an index.  If the `related_column' isn't an index,
the speed is independent of the number of arguments in the `IN' clause.


File: mysql.info,  Node: No matching rows,  Prev: Deleting from related tables,  Up: Query Issues

Solving Problems with No Matching Rows
--------------------------------------

If you have a complicated query that has many tables and that doesn't
return any rows, you should use the following procedure to find out what
is wrong with your query:

  1. Test the query with `EXPLAIN' and check if you can find something
     that is obviously wrong. *Note `EXPLAIN': EXPLAIN.

  2. Select only those fields that are used in the `WHERE' clause.

  3. Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns some
     rows.  If the tables are big, it's a good idea to use `LIMIT 10'
     with the query.

  4. Do a `SELECT' for the column that should have matched a row against
     the table that was last removed from the query.

  5. If you are comparing `FLOAT' or `DOUBLE' columns with numbers that
     have decimals, you can't use `='!  This problem is common in most
     computer languages because floating-point values are not exact
     values:

          mysql> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE float_column=3.5;
             ->
          mysql> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE float_column between 3.45 and 3.55;

     In most cases, changing the `FLOAT' to a `DOUBLE' will fix this!

  6. If you still can't figure out what's wrong, create a minimal test
     that can be run with `mysql test < query.sql' that shows your
     problems.  You can create a test file with `mysqldump --quick
     database tables > query.sql'. Open the file in an editor, remove
     some insert lines (if there are too many of these), and add your
     select statement at the end of the file.

     Test that you still have your problem by doing:

          shell> mysqladmin create test2
          shell> mysql test2 < query.sql

     Post the test file using `mysqlbug' to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.

Problems with `ALTER TABLE'.
----------------------------

`ALTER TABLE' changes a table to the current character set.  If you
during `ALTER TABLE' get a duplicate key error, then the cause is
either that the new character sets maps to keys to the same value or
that the table is corrupted, in which case you should run `REPAIR
TABLE' on the table.

If `ALTER TABLE' dies with an error like this:

     Error on rename of './database/name.frm' to './database/B-a.frm' (Errcode: 17)

the problem may be that MySQL has crashed in a previous `ALTER TABLE'
and there is an old table named `A-something' or `B-something' lying
around.  In this case, go to the MySQL data directory and delete all
files that have names starting with `A-' or `B-'.  (You may want to
move them elsewhere instead of deleting them.)

`ALTER TABLE' works the following way:

   * Create a new table named `A-xxx' with the requested changes.

   * All rows from the old table are copied to `A-xxx'.

   * The old table is renamed `B-xxx'.

   * `A-xxx' is renamed to your old table name.

   * `B-xxx' is deleted.

If something goes wrong with the renaming operation, MySQL tries to
undo the changes.  If something goes seriously wrong (this shouldn't
happen, of course), MySQL may leave the old table as `B-xxx', but a
simple rename on the system level should get your data back.

How To Change the Order of Columns in a Table
---------------------------------------------

The whole point of SQL is to abstract the application from the data
storage format.  You should always specify the order in which you wish
to retrieve your data.  For example:

     SELECT col_name1, col_name2, col_name3 FROM tbl_name;

will return columns in the order `col_name1', `col_name2', `col_name3',
whereas:

     SELECT col_name1, col_name3, col_name2 FROM tbl_name;

will return columns in the order `col_name1', `col_name3', `col_name2'.

You should *NEVER*, in an application, use `SELECT *' and retrieve the
columns based on their position, because the order in which columns are
returned *CANNOT* be guaranteed over time. A simple change to your
database may cause your application to fail rather dramatically.

If you want to change the order of columns anyway, you can do it as
follows:

  1. Create a new table with the columns in the right order.

  2. Execute `INSERT INTO new_table SELECT fields-in-new_table-order
     FROM old_table'.

  3. Drop or rename `old_table'.

  4. `ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME old_table'.

TEMPORARY TABLE problems
------------------------

The following are a list of the limitations with `TEMPORARY TABLES'.

   * A temporary table can only be of type `HEAP', `ISAM' or `MyISAM'.

   * You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
     For example, the following doesn't work.

          select * from temporary_table, temporary_table as t2;

     We plan to fix the above in 4.0.

   * You can't use `RENAME' on a `TEMPORARY' table.  Note that `ALTER
     TABLE org_name RENAME new_name' works!

     We plan to fix the above in 4.0.

MySQL customer usage
********************

The section 'Some MySQL Users' contains a lot of different links to
MySQL users but doesn't provide that much information about how they
are using MySQL.  *Note Users::. This manual section is to give you an
idea of how other MySQL users are using MySQL to solve their problems.

This manual section is very new and we plan to add more stories here
shortly.  If you are interested in contributing of how you use MySQL in
a unique environment or have success store about how you use MySQL, you
can write to `docs@mysql.com' with subject `Success:'.  Note that as we
are very busy it may take some time before you get some feedback for
your story.

   * *Peter Zaitsev of Spylog.ru* writes: I think you might be
     interested in my database size.  The whole database is currently
     on 15 servers and I think it's about 60.000 of tables containing
     about 5.000.000.000 of rows.  My mostly loaded server currently
     holds about 10.000 of tables with 1.000.000.000 of rows in it.
     Hugest tables have about 50.000.000 of rows, and this value will
     raise as soon as I'll move to 2.4 kernel with large files.
     Currently I have to delete much of logs for large sites to hold
     table sizes in 2Gb.

   * *Texas Instruments* is using MySQL for handling tables that
     contain up to 2,000 million rows in a validation regression
     database.

     This converter can't handle MEMO fields.

   * dbf2mysql.zip
     (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/dbf2mysql.zip) Convert
     between FoxPro `.dbf' files and MySQL tables on Windows.  By
     Alexander Eltsyn, <ae@nica.ru> or <ae@usa.net>.

   * dbf2sql.zip (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/dbf2sql.zip)
     Short and simple prg that can help you transport your data from
     foxpro table into MySQL table. By Danko Josic.

   * dump2h-1.20.gz
     (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/dump2h-1.20.gz) Convert
     from `mysqldump' output to a C header file. By Harry Brueckner,
     <brueckner@mail.respublica.de>.

   * exportsql.txt
     (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/exportsql.txt) A script
     that is similar to `access_to_mysql.txt', except that this one is
     fully configurable, has better type conversion (including
     detection of `TIMESTAMP' fields), provides warnings and suggestions
     while converting, quotes *all* special characters in text and
     binary data, and so on.  It will also convert to `mSQL' v1 and v2,
     and is free of charge for anyone. See
     `http://www.cynergi.net/exportsql/' for the latest version. By
     Pedro Freire, <support@cynergi.net>.  NOTE: Doesn't work with
     Access2!

   * access_to_mysql.txt
     (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/access_to_mysql.txt) Paste
     this function into an Access module of a database that has the
     tables you want to export. See also `exportsql'. By Brian Andrews.
     NOTE: Doesn't work with Access2!

   * importsql.txt
     (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/importsql.txt) A script
     that does the exact reverse of `exportsql.txt'.  That is, it
     imports data from MySQL into an Access database via ODBC. This is
     very handy when combined with exportsql, because it lets you use
     Access for all DB design and administration, and synchronize with
     your actual MySQL server either way. Free of charge. See
     `http://www.netdive.com/freebies/importsql/' for any updates.
     Created by Laurent Bossavit of NetDIVE.  *NOTE:* Doesn't work with
     Access2!

     A C wrapper from `mSQL' to MySQL. By <alfred@sb.net>

   * sqlconv.pl (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/sqlconv.pl) A
     simple script that can be used to copy fields from one MySQL table
     to another in bulk. Basically, you can run `mysqldump' and pipe it
     to the `sqlconv.pl' script. The script will parse through the
     `mysqldump' output and will rearrange the fields so they can be
     inserted into a new table. An example is when you want to create a
     new table for a different site you are working on, but the table
     is just a bit different (that is - fields in different order,
     etc.).  By Steve Shreeve.

   * oracledump (http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/oracledump)
     Perl program to convert Oracle databases to MySQL. Has same output

Developers at MySQL AB
======================

These are the developers that are or have been employed by MySQL AB to
work on MySQL, roughly in the order they started to work with us.
Following each developer is a small list of the tasks that the
developer is responsible for, or the accomplishments they have made.

Michael (Monty) Widenius
     Has written the following parts of MySQL:
        * All the main code in `mysqld'.

        * New functions for the string library.

        * Most of the `mysys' library.

        * The `ISAM' and `MyISAM' libraries (B-tree index file handlers
          with index compression and different record formats).

        * The `HEAP' library. A memory table system with our superior
          full dynamic hashing. In use since 1981 and published around
          1984.

        * The `replace' program (look into it, it's COOL!).

        * *MyODBC*, the ODBC driver for Windows95.

        * Fixing bugs in MIT-pthreads to get it to work for MySQL. And
          also Unireg, a curses-based application tool with many
          utilities.

        * Porting of `mSQL' tools like `msqlperl', `DBD'/`DBI', and
          `DB2mysql'.

        * Most of crash-me and the foundation for the MySQL benchmarks.

David Axmark
        * Coordinator and initial main writer of the *Reference Manual*,
          including enhancements to `texi2html'.

        * Automatic Web site updating from the manual.

        * Initial Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool support.

        * The licensing stuff.

        * Parts of all the text files.  (Nowadays only the `README' is
          left. The rest ended up in the manual.)

        * Lots of testing of new features.

        * Our in-house "free" software lawyer.

        * Mailing list maintainer (who never has the time to do it
          right...)

        * Our original portability code (more than 10 years old now).
          Nowadays only some parts of `mysys' are left.

        * Someone for Monty to call in the middle of the night when he
          just got that new feature to work.

Jani Tolonen
        * `mysqlimport'

        * A lot of extensions to the `mysql' client.

        * `procedure analyse()'

          protocol).

        * MySQL Filesystem (A way to use MySQL databases as files and
          directories).

        * The CASE Expression.

        * The MD5() and COALESCE() functions.

        * `RAID' support for `MyISAM' tables.

Sasha Pachev
        * Replication.

        * `SHOW CREATE TABLE'.

Contributors to MySQL
=====================

Contributors to the MySQL distribution are listed here, in somewhat
random order:

Paul DuBois
     Help with making the Reference Manual correct and understandable.
     That includes rewriting Monty's and David's attempts at English
     into English as other people know it.

Gianmassimo Vigazzola <qwerg@mbox.vol.it> or <qwerg@tin.it>
     The initial port to Win32/NT.

Kim Aldale
     Helped to rewrite Monty's and David's early attempts at English
     into English.

Per Eric Olsson
     For more or less constructive criticism and real testing of the
     dynamic record format.

Irena Pancirov <irena@mail.yacc.it>
     Win32 port with Borland compiler.  `mysqlshutdown.exe' and
     `mysqlwatch.exe'

David J. Hughes
     For the effort to make a shareware SQL database. We at TcX started
     with `mSQL', but found that it couldn't satisfy our purposes so
     instead we wrote a SQL interface to our application builder
     Unireg.  `mysqladmin' and `mysql' are programs that were largely
     influenced by their `mSQL' counterparts. We have put a lot of
     effort into making the MySQL syntax a superset of `mSQL'. Many of
     the API's ideas are borrowed from `mSQL' to make it easy to port
     free `mSQL' programs to MySQL. MySQL doesn't contain any code from
     `mSQL'.  Two files in the distribution (`client/insert_test.c' and
     `client/select_test.c') are based on the corresponding
     (non-copyrighted) files in the `mSQL' distribution, but are
     modified as examples showing the changes necessary to convert code
     from `mSQL' to MySQL.  (`mSQL' is copyrighted David J. Hughes.)

Fred Fish
     For his excellent C debugging and trace library. Monty has made a
     number of smaller improvements to the library (speed and
     additional options).

Richard A. O'Keefe
     For his public domain string library.

Henry Spencer
     For his regex library, used in `WHERE column REGEXP regexp'.

Free Software Foundation
     From whom we got an excellent compiler (`gcc'), the `libc' library
     (from which we have borrowed `strto.c' to get some code working in
     Linux), and the `readline' library (for the `mysql' client).

Free Software Foundation & The XEmacs development team
     For a really great editor/environment used by almost everybody at
     TcX/MySQL AB/detron.

Patrick Lynch
     For helping us acquire `http://www.mysql.com/'.

Fred Lindberg
     For setting up qmail to handle the MySQL mailing list and for the
     incredible help we got in managing the MySQL mailing lists.

Igor Romanenko <igor@frog.kiev.ua>
     `mysqldump' (previously `msqldump', but ported and enhanced by
     Monty).

Yuri Dario
     For keeping up and extending the MySQL OS/2 port.

Tim Bunce, Alligator Descartes
     For the `DBD' (Perl) interface.

Eugene Chan <eugene@acenet.com.sg>
     For porting PHP to MySQL.

Michael J. Miller Jr. <mke@terrapin.turbolift.com>
     For the first MySQL manual. And a lot of spelling/language fixes
     for the FAQ (that turned into the MySQL manual a long time ago).

Yan Cailin
     First translator of the MySQL Reference Manual into simplified
     chinese in early 2000 on which the Big5 and HK coded
     (mysql.hitstar.com (http://mysql.hitstar.com)) versions were
     based. Personal home page at linuxdb.yeah.net
     (http://linuxdb.yeah.net).

Giovanni Maruzzelli <maruzz@matrice.it>
     For porting iODBC (Unix ODBC).

Chris Provenzano
     Portable user level pthreads. From the copyright: This product
     includes software developed by Chris Provenzano, the University of
     California, Berkeley, and contributors.  We are currently using
     version 1_60_beta6 patched by Monty (see
     `mit-pthreads/Changes-mysql').

Xavier Leroy <Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr>
     The author of LinuxThreads (used by MySQL on Linux).

Zarko Mocnik <zarko.mocnik@dem.si>
     Sorting for Slovenian language and the `cset.tar.gz' module that

Note that we tend to update the manual at the same time we make changes
to MySQL.  If you find a version listed below that you can't find on the
MySQL download page (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/), this means that
the version has not yet been released!

Changes in release 4.0.x (Development; Alpha)
=============================================

We have now started to work on MySQL 4.0.  We will update this section
as we add new features, so that others can follow our development.

Our TODO section contains what we plan to have in 4.0. *Note TODO MySQL

Changes in release 4.0.0
------------------------

   * Multi-table `DELETE'.

   * Don't support old client protocols prior to MySQL 3.21 any more.

   * Don't include the old C API functions `mysql_drop_db',
     `mysql_create_db' and `mysql_connect', unless compiled with
     `USE_OLD_FUNCTIONS'.

   * Renamed `safe_mysqld' to `mysqld_safe'.

   * Allow `IN' as a synonym for `FROM' in `SHOW' commands.

   * `SHOW INDEXES' is now a synonym for `SHOW INDEX'.

   * Added support for symbolic links to `MyISAM' tables. Symlink
     handling is now enabled by default for Windows.

   * `LOAD DATA FROM MASTER' "auto-magically" sets up a slave.

   * A new `HANDLER' interface to `MyISAM' tables.

   * `COUNT(DISTINCT)' is about 30% faster.

   * `FULLTEXT' index creation now is much faster.

   * Searching on packed (`CHAR'/`VARCHAR') keys now is much faster.

   * Added `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS' and `FOUND_ROWS()'. This makes it
     possible to know how many rows a query would have returned without
     a `LIMIT' clause.

   * Changed output format of `SHOW OPEN TABLES'.

   * Allow `SELECT expression LIMIT ...'.

   * Added `IDENTITY' as a synonym for `AUTO_INCREMENT' (like Sybase).

   * Added `ORDER BY' syntax to `UPDATE' and `DELETE'.

   * Optimized queries of type: `SELECT DISTINCT * from table_name
     ORDER by key_part1 LIMIT #'

Changes in release 3.23.x  (Stable)
===================================

The 3.23 release has several major features that are not present in
previous versions.  We have added three new table types:

*MyISAM*
     A new ISAM library which is tuned for SQL and supports large files.

*BerkeleyDB* or *BDB*
     Uses the Berkeley DB library from Sleepycat Software to implement
     transaction-safe tables.

*InnoDB*
     A transaction-safe table handler that supports row level locking,
     and many Oracle-like features.

Note that only MyISAM is available in the standard binary distribution.

The 3.23 release also includes support for database replication between
a master and many slaves, full-text indexing, and much more.

All new features are being developed in the 4.0 version.  Only bug
fixes and minor enhancements to existing features will be added to 3.23.

The replication code and BerkeleyDB code is still not as tested and as
the rest of the code, so we will probably need to do a couple of future
releases of 3.23 with small fixes for this part of the code. As long as
you don't use these features, you should be quite safe with MySQL 3.23!

Note that the above doesn't mean that replication or Berkeley DB don't
work; We have done a lot of testing of all code, including replication
and BDB without finding any problems.  It only means that not as many
users use this code as the rest of the code and because of this we are
not yet 100% confident in this code.

Changes in release 3.23.51
--------------------------

   * Cleaned up `NULL' handling for default values in `DESCRIBE
     table_name'.

   * Fixed `truncate()' to round up negative values to the nearest
     integer.

   * Remove end space from `enum' values. (This fixed a problem with
     `SHOW CREATE TABLE').

   * Fixed bug in `CONCAT_WS()' that cut the result.

   * Changed name of variables `Com_show_master_stat' to
     `Com_show_master_status' and `Com_show_slave_stat' to
     `Com_show_slave_status'.

   * Changed handling of `gethostbyname()' to make the client library
     threadsafe even if `gethostbyname_r' doesn't exists.

   * Fixed core-dump problem when giving a wrong password string to
     `GRANT'.

   * Fixed bug in `DROP DATABASE' with symlinked directory.

   * Fixed optimization problem with `DATETIME' and value outside
     `DATETIME' range.

   * Removed BDB documentation.

   * Fixed mit-pthreads to compile with glibc 2.2 (needed for `make
     dist').

   * Fixed the `FLOAT(X+1,X)' is not converted to `FLOAT(X+2,X)'.
     (This also affected `DECIMAL', `DOUBLE' and `REAL' types)

   * Fixed the result from `IF()' is case in-sensitive if the 2 and
     third arguments are case sensitive.

   * Fixed core dump problem on OSF in `gethostbyname_r'.

   * Fixed that underflowed decimal fields is not zero filled.

   * If we get an overflow when inserting `'+11111'' for `decimal(5,0)
     unsigned' columns, we will just drop the sign.

   * Fixed optimization bug with
     `ISNULL(expression_which_cannot_be_null)' and
     `ISNULL(constant_expression)'.

   * Fixed host lookup bug in the glibc library that we used with the
     3.23.50 Linux-x86 binaries.

Changes in release 3.23.50
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem with `crash-me' and gcc 3.0.4.

   * Fixed that `@@unknown_variable' doesn't hang server.

   * Added `@@VERSION' as a synonym for `VERSION()'.

   * `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'xxx'' is now case insensitive.

   * Fixed timeout for `GET_LOCK()' on HPUX with DCE threads.

   * Fixed memory allocation bug in the glibc library used to build
     Linux binaries, which caused mysqld to die in 'free()'.

   * Fixed `SIGINT' and `SIGQUIT' problems in `mysql'.

   * Fixed bug in character table converts when used with big ( > 64K)
     strings.

   * `InnoDB' now retains foreign key constraints through `ALTER TABLE'
     and `CREATE/DROP INDEX'.

   * `InnoDB' now allows foreign key constraints to be added through the
     `ALTER TABLE' syntax.

   * `InnoDB' tables can now be set to automatically grow in size
     (autoextend).

   * Fixed some buffer overflow problems when reading startup
     parameters.

   * Because of problems on shutdown we have now disabled named pipes on
     windows by default.  One can enable named pipes by starting mysqld
     with `--enable-named-pipe'.

   * Fixed bug when using `WHERE key_column = 'J' or key_column='j''.

   * Fixed core-dump bug when using `--log-bin' with `LOAD DATA INFILE'
     without an active database.

   * Fixed bug in `RENAME TABLE' when used with
     `lower_case_table_names=1' (default on Windows).

   * Fixed unlikely core-dump bug when using `DROP TABLE' on a table
     that was in use by a thread that also used queries on only
     temporary tables.

   * Fixed problem with `SHOW CREATE TABLE' and `PRIMARY KEY' when using
     32 indexes.

   * Fixed that one can use `SET PASSWORD' for the anonymous user.

   * Fixed core-dump bug when reading client groups from option files
     using `mysql_options()'.

   * Memory leak (16 bytes per every *corrupted* table) closed.

   * Fixed binary builds to use `--enable-local-infile'.

   * Update source to work with new `bison' version.

   * Updated shell scripts to new agree with new POSIX standard.

   * Fixed bug where `DATE_FORMAT()' returned empty string when used
     with `GROUP BY'.

Changes in release 3.23.49
--------------------------

   * Don't give warning for statement that is only a comment;  This is
     needed for `mysqldump --disable-keys' to work.

   * Fixed unlikely caching bug when doing a join without keys. In this
     case the last used column for a table always returned `NULL'.

   * Added options to make `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE' more secure.

   * MySQL binary release 3.23.48 for Linux contained a new glibc
     library, which has serious problems under high load and RedHat
     7.2.  The 3.23.49 binary release doesn't have this problem.

   * Fixed shutdown problem on NT.

Changes in release 3.23.48
--------------------------

   * Changed to use `autoconf' 2.52 (from `autoconf' 2.13)

   * Fixed bug in complicated join with `const' tables.

   * Added internal safety checks for InnoDB.

   * Some InnoDB variables was always shown in `SHOW VARIABLES' as
     `OFF' on high-byte-first systems (like sparc).

   * Fixed problem with one thread using an InnoDB table and another
     thread doing an `ALTER TABLE' on the same table. Before that,
     mysqld could crash with an assertion failure in row0row.c, line
     474.

   * Tuned the InnoDB SQL optimizer to favor more often index searches
     over table scans.

   * Fixed a performance problem with InnoDB tables when several large
     SELECT queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux
     computer.  Large CPU-bound SELECT queries will now also generally
     run faster on all platforms.

   * If MySQL binlogging is used, InnoDB now prints after crash
     recovery the latest MySQL binlog name and the offset InnoDB was
     able to recover to. This is useful, for example, when
     resynchronizing a master and a slave database in replication.

   * Added better error messages to help in installation problems of
     InnoDB tables.

   * One can now recover also MySQL temporary tables which have become
     orphaned inside the InnoDB tablespace.

   * InnoDB now prevents a `FOREIGN KEY' declaration where the
     signedness is not the same in the referencing and referenced
     integer columns.

   * Calling `SHOW CREATE TABLE' or `SHOW TABLE STATUS' could cause
     memory corruption and make mysqld to crash.  Especially at risk was
     `mysqldump', because it calls frequently `SHOW CREATE TABLE'.

   * If inserts to several tables containing an auto-inc column were
     wrapped inside one `LOCK TABLES', InnoDB asserted in lock0lock.c.

   * In 3.23.47 we allowed several `NULLS' in a `UNIQUE' secondary
     index for an InnoDB table.  But `CHECK TABLE' was not relaxed: it
     reports the table as corrupt.  `CHECK TABLE' no longer complains in
     this situation.

   * `SHOW GRANTS' now shows `REFERENCES' instead of `REFERENCE'.

--------------------------

   * Fixed in when using the following construct: `SELECT ... WHERE

   * Restrict InnoDB keys to 500 bytes.

   * InnoDB now supports `NULL' in keys.

   * Fixed shutdown problem on HPUX. (Introduced in 3.23.46)

   * Fixed core-dump bug in replication when using SELECT
     RELEASE_LOCK();

   * Added new command: `DO expression,[expression]'

   * Added `slave-skip-errors' option

   * Added statistics variables for all MySQL commands. (`SHOW STATUS'
     is now much longer).

   * Fixed default values for InnoDB tables.

   * Fixed that `GROUP BY expr DESC' works.

   * Fixed bug when using `t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t2.key=constant'.

   * `mysql_config' now also work with binary (relocated) distributions.

--------------------------

   * Fixed problem with aliased temporary tables replication

   * InnoDB and BDB tables will now use index when doing an `ORDER BY'
     on the whole table.

   * Fixed bug where one got an empty set instead of a DEADLOCK error
     when using BDB tables.

   * One can now kill `ANALYZE',`REPAIR' and `OPTIMIZE TABLE' when the
     thread is waiting to get a lock on the table.

   * Fixed race condition in `ANALYZE TABLE'.

   * Fixed bug when joining with caching (unlikely to happen).

   * Fixed race condition when using the binary log and `INSERT DELAYED'
     which could cause the binary log to have rows that was not yet
     written to MyISAM tables.

   * Changed caching of binary log to make replication slightly faster.

   * Fixed bug in replication on Mac OS X.

   * `--core-file' now works on Solaris.

   * Fix a bug which could cause InnoDB to complain if it cannot find
     free blocks from the buffer cache during recovery.

   * Fixed bug in InnoDB insert buffer B-tree handling that could cause
     crashes.

   * Fixed bug in InnoDB lock timeout handling.

   * Fixed core dump bug in `ALTER TABLE' on a `TEMPORARY' InnoDB table.

   * Fixed bug in `OPTIMIZE TABLE' that reset index cardinality if it
     was up to date.

   * Fixed problem with `t1 LEFT_JOIN t2 ... WHERE t2.date_column IS
     NULL' when date_column was declared as `NOT NULL'.

   * Fixed bug with BDB tables and keys on `BLOB''s.

   * Fixed bug in `MERGE' tables on OS with 32 bit file pointers.

   * Fixed bug in `TIME_TO_SEC()' when using negative values.

Changes in release 3.23.44
--------------------------

   * Fixed `Rows_examined' count in slow query log.

   * Fixed bug when using a reference to a `AVG()' column in `HAVING'.

   * Fixed that date functions that require correct dates, like
     `DAYOFYEAR(column)' will return `NULL' for `0000-00-00' dates.

   * Fixed bug in const-propagation when comparing columns of different
     types. (`SELECT * FROM date_col="2001-01-01" and
     date_col=time_col')

   * Fixed bug that caused error message `Can't write, because of unique
     constraint' with some `GROUP BY' queries.

   * Fixed problem with sjis character strings used within quoted table
     names.

   * Fixed coredump when using `CREATE ... FULLTEXT' keys with other
     table handlers than MyISAM.

   * Don't use `signal()' on windows because this appears to not be 100
     % reliable.

   * Fixed bug when doing `WHERE column_name=NULL' on an indexed column
     that had `NULL' values.

   * Fixed bug when doing `LEFT JOIN ...  ON (column_name = constant)
     WHERE column_name = constant'.

   * When using replications, aborted queries that contained `%' could
     cause a core dump.

   * `TCP_NODELAY' was not used on some systems. (Speed problem).

   * Applied portability fixes for OS/2 (Patch by Yuri Dario).

The following changes are for `InnoDB' tables:

   * Add missing `InnoDB' variables to `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Foreign keys checking is now done for `InnoDB' tables.

   * `DROP DATABASE' now works also for `InnoDB' tables.

   * `InnoDB' now supports data files and raw disk partitions bigger
     than 4 GB on those operating systems which have big files.

   * `InnoDB' calculates better table cardinality estimates for the
     MySQL optimizer.

   * Accent characters in the default character set latin1 are ordered
     according to the MySQL ordering.

     NOTE: if you are using latin1 and have inserted characters whose
     code is > 127 to an indexed CHAR column, you should run CHECK
     TABLE on your table when you upgrade to 3.23.44, and drop and
     reimport the table if CHECK TABLE reports an error!

   * A new `my.cnf' parameter `innodb_thread_concurrency' helps in
     performance tuning in heavily concurrent environments.

   * A new `my.cnf' parameter `innodb_fast_shutdown' speeds up server
     shutdown.

   * A new `my.cnf' parameter `innodb_force_recovery' helps to save
     your data in case the disk image of the database becomes corrupt.

   * `innodb_monitor' has been improved and a new
     `innodb_table_monitor' added.

   * Increased maximum key length from 500 to 7000 bytes.

   * Fixed a bug in replication of auto-inc columns with multiline
     inserts.

   * Fixed a bug when the case of letters changes in an update of an
     indexed secondary column.

   * Fixed a hang when there are > 24 data files.

   * Fixed a crash when `MAX(col)' is selected from an empty table, and
     col is a not the first column in a multi-column index.

   * Fixed a bug in purge which could cause crashes.

     3.23.42.

   * Fixed unlikely bug, which returned not matching rows, in SELECT
     with many tables and multi-column indexes and 'range' type.

   * Fixed a unlikely core-dump bug when doing `EXPLAIN SELECT' when
     using many tables and `ORDER BY'.

     `CHECKSUM=1'.

   * Added unique error message when one gets a DEADLOCK during a
     transaction with BDB tables.

   * Fixed problem with `BDB' tables and `UNIQUE' columns defined as
     `NULL'.

   * Fixed problem with `myisampack' when using pre-space filled CHAR
     columns.

   * Applied patch from Yuri Dario for OS2.

   * Fixed bug in `--safe-user-create'

Changes in release 3.23.42
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem when using `LOCK TABLES' and `BDB' tables.

   * Fixed problem with `REPAIR TABLE' on MyISAM tables with row lengths
     between 65517 - 65520 bytes

   * Fixed rare hang when doing `mysqladmin shutdown' when there was a
     lot of activity in other threads.

   * Fixed problem with `INSERT DELAYED' where delay thread could be
     hanging on `upgrading locks' without any apparent reasons.

   * Fixed problem with `myisampack' and `BLOB'.

   * Fixes problem when one edited `.MRG' tables by hand.  (Patch from
     Benjamin Pflugmann).

   * Enforce that all tables in a `MERGE' table come from the same
     database.

   * Fixed bug with `LOAD DATA INFILE' and transactional tables.

   * Fix bug when using `INSERT DELAYED' with wrong column definition.

   * Fixed coredump during `REPAIR' of some particularly broken tables.

   * Fixed bug in `InnoDB' and `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns.

   * Fixed bug in `InnoDB' and `RENAME TABLE' columns.

   * Fixed critical bug in `InnoDB' and `BLOB' columns.  If one has
     used `BLOB' columns larger than 8000 bytes in an `InnoDB' table,
     one must dump the table with `mysqldump', drop it and restore it
     from the dump.

   * Applied large patch for OS/2 from Yuri Dario.

   * Fixed problem with `InnoDB' when one could get the error `Can't
     execute the given command...' even when one didn't have an active
     transaction.

   * Applied some minor fixes that concern Gemini.

   * Use real arithmetic operations even in integer context if not all
     arguments are integers. (Fixes uncommon bug in some integer
     contexts).

   * Don't force everything to lower cases on Windows. (To fix problem
     with Windows and `ALTER TABLE').  Now `--lower_case_names' also
     works on Unix.

   * Fixed that automatic rollback that is done when thread end doesn't
     lock other threads.

Changes in release 3.23.41
--------------------------

   * Added option `--sql-mode=option[,option[,option]]'.  *Note
     Command-line options::.

   * Fixed possible problem with `shutdown' on Solaris where the `.pid'
     file wasn't deleted.

   * InnoDB now supports < 4 GB rows. The former limit was 8000 bytes.

   * The `doublewrite' file flush method is used in `InnoDB'.  It
     reduces the need for Unix fsync calls to a fraction and improves
     performance on most Unix flavors.

   * You can now use the `InnoDB' Monitor to print a lot of `InnoDB'
     state information, including locks, to the standard output; useful
     in performance tuning.

   * Several bugs which could cause hangs in `InnoDB' have been fixed.

   * Split `record_buffer' to `record_buffer' and `record_rnd_buffer'.
     To make things compatible to previous MySQL versions, if
     `record_rnd_buffer' is not set, then it takes the value of
     `record_buffer'.

   * Fixed optimizing bug in `ORDER BY' where some `ORDER BY' parts
     where wrongly removed.

   * Fixed overflow bug with `ALTER TABLE' and `MERGE' tables.

   * Added prototypes for `my_thread_init()' and `my_thread_end()' to
     `mysql_com.h'

   * Added option `--safe-user-create' to `mysqld'.

   * Fixed bug in `SELECT DISTINCT ... HAVING' that casued error message
     `Can't find record in '#...'

Changes in release 3.23.40
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem with `--low-priority-updates' and `INSERT''s.

   * Fixed bug in slave thread when under some rare circumstances it
     could get 22 bytes ahead on the offset in the master.

   * Added `slave_wait_timeout' for replication.

   * Fixed problem with `UPDATE' and `BDB' tables.

   * Fixed hard bug in `BDB' tables when using key parts.

   * Fixed problem when using the `GRANT FILE ON database.* ...';
     Previously we added the `DROP' privilege for the database.

   * Fixed `DELETE FROM table_name ... LIMIT 0' and `UPDATE FROM
     table_name ... LIMIT 0' acted as though the `LIMIT' clause was not
     present (they deleted or updated all selected rows).

   * `CHECK TABLE' now checks if an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column contains
     the value 0.

   * Sending a `SIGHUP' to `mysqld' will now only flush the logs, not
     reset the replication.

   * Fixed parser to allow floats of type `1.0e1' (no sign after `e').

   * Option `--force' to `myisamchk' now also updates states.

   * Added option `--warnings' to `mysqld'. Now `mysqld' only prints
     the error `Aborted connection' if this option is used.

   * Fixed problem with `SHOW CREATE TABLE' when you didn't have a
     `PRIMARY KEY'.

   * Properly fixed the rename of `innodb_unix_file_flush_method' to
     `innodb_flush_method'.

   * Fixed bug when converting `UNSIGNED BIGINT' to `DOUBLE'. This
     caused a problem when doing comparisons with `BIGINT' values
     outside of the signed range.

   * Fixed bug in `BDB' tables when querying empty tables.

   * Fixed a bug when using `COUNT(DISTINCT)' with `LEFT JOIN' and
     there wasn't any matching rows.

   * Removed all documentation referring to the `GEMINI' table type.
     `GEMINI' is not released under an Open Source license.

Changes in release 3.23.39
--------------------------

   * The `AUTO_INCREMENT' sequence wasn't reset when dropping and
     adding an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column.

   * `CREATE ... SELECT' now creates non-unique indexes delayed.

   * Fixed problem where `LOCK TABLES table_name READ' followed by
     `FLUSH TABLES' put an exclusive lock on the table.

   * `REAL' @variables with was represented with 2 digits when
     converted to strings.

   * Fixed problem that client 'hung' when `LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER'
     failed.

   * Running `myisamchk --fast --force' will no longer repair tables
     that only had the open count wrong.

   * Added functions to handle symbolic links to make life easier in
     4.0.

   * We are now using the `-lcma' thread library on HP-UX 10.20 so that
     MySQL will be more stable on HP-UX.

   * Fixed problem with `IF()' and number of decimals in the result.

   * Fixed date-part extraction functions to work with dates where day
     and/or month is 0.

   * Extended argument length in option files from 256 to 512 chars.

   * Fixed problem with shutdown when `INSERT DELAYED' was waiting for
     a `LOCK TABLE'.

   * Fixed coredump bug in `InnoDB' when tablespace was full.

   * Fixed problem with `MERGE' tables and big tables (> 4G) when using
     `ORDER BY'.

--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug when `SELECT' from `MERGE' table sometimes results in
     incorrectly ordered rows.

   * Fixed a bug in `REPLACE()' when using the ujis character set.

   * Applied Sleepycat BDB patches 3.2.9.1 and 3.2.9.2.

   * Added option `--skip-stack-trace' to `mysqld'.

   * `CREATE TEMPORARY' now works with `InnoDB' tables.

   * `InnoDB' now promotes sub keys to whole keys.

   * Added option `CONCURRENT' to `LOAD DATA'.

   * Better error message when slave `max_allowed_packet' is too low to
     read a very long log event from the master.

   * Fixed bug when too many rows where removed when using `SELECT
     DISTINCT ... HAVING'.

   * `SHOW CREATE TABLE' now returns `TEMPORARY' for temporary tables.

   * Added `Rows_examined' to slow query log.

   * Fixed problems with function returning empty string when using
     together with a group functions and a `WHERE' that didn't match
     any rows.

   * New program `mysqlcheck'.

   * Added database name to output for administrative commands like
     `CHECK', `REPAIR', `OPTIMIZE'.

   * Lots of portability fixes for `InnoDB'.

   * Changed optimizer so that queries like `SELECT * FROM
     table_name,table_name2 ... ORDER BY key_part1 LIMIT #' will use
     index on `key_part1' instead of `filesort'.

   * Fixed bug when doing `LOCK TABLE to_table WRITE,...; INSERT INTO
     to_table... SELECT ...' when `to_table' was empty.

   * Fixed bug with `LOCK TABLE' and BDB tables.

Changes in release 3.23.37
--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug when using `MATCH' in `HAVING' clause.

   * Fixed a bug when using `HEAP' tables with `LIKE'.

   * Added `--mysql-version' to `safe_mysqld'

   * Changed `INNOBASE' to `InnoDB' (because the `INNOBASE' name was
     already used). All `configure' options and `mysqld' start options
     are now using `innodb' instead of `innobase'. This means that you
     have to change any configuration files where you have used
     `innobase' options before upgrading to this version!

   * Fixed bug when using indexes on `CHAR(255) NULL' columns.

   * Slave thread will now be started even if `master-host' is not set,
     as long as `server-id' is set and valid `master.info' is present

   * Partial updates (terminated with kill) are now logged with a
     special error code to the binary log. Slave will refuse to execute
     them if the error code indicates the update was terminated
     abnormally, and will have to be recovered with `SET
     SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START' after a manual sanity
     check/correction of data integrity.

   * Fixed bug that erroneously logged a drop of internal temporary
     table on thread termination to the binary log - bug affected
     replication.

   * Fixed a bug in `REGEXP()' on 64-bit machines.

   * `UPDATE' and `DELETE' with `WHERE unique_key_part IS NULL' didn't
     update/delete all rows.

   * Disabled `INSERT DELAYED' for tables that support transactions.

   * Fixed bug when using date functions on `TEXT'/`BLOB' column with
     wrong date format.

   * UDFs now also work on Windows. (Patch by Ralph Mason)

   * Fixed bug in `ALTER TABLE' and `LOAD DATA INFILE' that disabled
     key-sorting. These commands should now be faster in most cases.

   * Fixed performance bug where reopened tables (tables that had been
     waiting for `FLUSH' or `REPAIR') would not use indexes for the
     next query.

   * Fixed problem with `ALTER TABLE' to Innobase tables on FreeBSD.

   * Added `mysqld' variables `myisam_max_sort_file_size' and
     `myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size'.

   * Initialize signals early to avoid problem with signals in Innobase.

   * Applied patch for the `tis620' character set to make comparisons
     case-independent and to fix a bug in `LIKE' for this character set.
     *NOTE*: All tables that uses the `tis620' character set must be
     fixed with  `myisamchk -r' or `REPAIR TABLE' !

   * Added `--skip-safemalloc' option to `mysqld'.

Changes in release 3.23.36
--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug that allowed you to use database names containing a `.'
     character.  This fixes a serious security issue when `mysqld' is
     run as root.

   * Fixed bug when thread creation failed (could happen when doing a
     LOT of connections in a short time).

   * Fixed some problems with `FLUSH TABLES' and `TEMPORARY' tables.
     (Problem with freeing the key cache and error `Can't reopen
     table...').

   * Fixed a problem in Innobase with other character sets than `latin1'
     and another problem when using many columns.

   * Fixed bug that caused a core dump when using a very complex query
     involving `DISTINCT' and summary functions.

   * Added `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...'

   * Added `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE'.

   * Fixed bug where the number of affected rows was not returned when
     `MySQL' was compiled without transaction support.

   * Fixed a bug in `UPDATE' where keys weren't always used to find the
     rows to be updated.

   * Fixed a bug in `CONCAT_WS()' where it returned wrong results.

   * Changed `CREATE ... INSERT' and `INSERT ... SELECT' to not allow
     concurrent inserts as this could make the binary log hard to
     repeat.  (Concurrent inserts are enabled if you are not using the
     binary or update log).

   * Changed some macros to be able to use fast mutex with glibc 2.2.

Changes in release 3.23.34
--------------------------

   * Added the `INNOBASE' table handler and the `BDB' table handler to
     the MySQL source distribution.

   * Updated the documentation about `GEMINI' tables.

   * Fixed a bug in `INSERT DELAYED' that caused threads to hang when
     inserting `NULL' into an `AUTO_INCREMENT' column.

   * Fixed a bug in `CHECK TABLE' / `REPAIR TABLE' that could cause a
     thread to hang.

   * `REPLACE' will not replace a row that conflicts with an
     `auto_increment' generated key.

   * `mysqld' now only sets `CLIENT_TRANSACTIONS' in
     `mysql->server_capabilities' if the server supports a
     transaction-safe handler.

   * Fixed `LOAD DATA INFILE' to allow numeric values to be read into
     `ENUM' and `SET' columns.

   * Improved error diagnostic for slave thread exit.

   * Fixed bug in `ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY'.

   * Added option `max_user_connections' to `mysqld'.

   * Limit query length for replication by `max_allowed_packet', not the
     arbitrary limit of 4 MB.

   * Allow space around `=' in argument to `--set-variable'.

   * Fixed problem in automatic repair that could leave some threads in
     state `Waiting for table'.

   * `SHOW CREATE TABLE' now dumps the `UNION()' for `MERGE' tables.

   * `ALTER TABLE' now remembers the old `UNION()' definition.

   * Fixed bug when replicating timestamps.

   * Fixed bug in bidirectional replication.

   * Fixed bug in the `BDB' table handler that occurred when using an
     index on multi-part key where a key part may be `NULL'.

   * Fixed `MAX()' optimization on sub-key for `BDB' tables.

   * Fixed problem where garbage results were returned when using `BDB'
     tables and `BLOB' or `TEXT' fields when joining many tables.

   * Fixed a problem with `BDB' tables and `TEXT' columns.

   * Fixed bug when using a `BLOB' key where a const row wasn't found.

   * Fixed that `mysqlbinlog' writes the timestamp value for each query.
     This ensures that one gets same values for date functions like
     `NOW()' when using `mysqlbinlog' to pipe the queries to another
     server.

   * Allow one to use `--skip-gemini', `--skip-bdb' and
     `--skip-innobase' to `mysqld' even if these databases are not
     compiled in `mysqld'.

   * One can now do `GROUP BY ... DESC'.

   * Fixed a deadlock in the `SET' code, when one ran `SET @foo=bar',
     where `bar' is a column reference, an error was not properly
     generated.

Changes in release 3.23.33
--------------------------

   * Fixed that DNS lookups are not using the same mutex as the hostname
     cache.  This will enable known hosts to be quickly resolved even
     if a DNS lookup takes a long time.

   * Added `--character-sets-dir' to `myisampack'.

   * Removed warnings when running `REPAIR TABLE ... EXTENDED'.

   * Fixed a bug that caused a core dump when using `GROUP BY' on an
     alias, where the alias was the same as an existing column name.

   * Added `SEQUENCE()' as an example UDF function.

   * Changed `mysql_install_db' to use `BINARY' for `CHAR' columns in
     the privilege tables.

   * Changed `TRUNCATE table_name' to `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name' to
     use the same syntax as Oracle.  Until 4.0 we will also allow
     `TRUNCATE table_name' to not crash old code.

   * Fixed 'no found rows' bug in `MyISAM' tables when a `BLOB' was
     first part of a multi-part key.

   * Fixed bug where `CASE' didn't work with `GROUP BY'.

   * Added option `--sort-recover' to `myisamchk'.

   * `myisamchk -S' and `OPTIMIZE TABLE' now work on Windows.

   * Fixed bug when using `DISTINCT' on results from functions that
     referred to a group function, like:
          SELECT a, DISTINCT SEC_TO_TIME(sum(a)) from table_name GROUP BY a, b;

   * Fixed buffer overrun in `libmysqlclient' library.  Fixed bug in
     handling `STOP' event after `ROTATE' event in replication.

   * Fixed another buffer overrun in `DROP DATABASE'.

   * Added `Table_locks_immediate' and `Table_locks_waited' status
     variables.

   * Fixed bug in replication that broke slave server start with
     existing `master.info'. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.23.32.

   * Added `SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n' command to recover from
     replication glitches without a full database copy.

   * Added `max_binlog_size' variable; the binary log will be rotated
     automatically when the size crosses the limit.

   * Added `Last_error', `Last_errno', and `Slave_skip_counter' to
     `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'.

   * Fixed bug in `MASTER_POS_WAIT()' function.

   * Execute coredump handler on `SIGILL', and `SIGBUS' in addition to
     `SIGSEGV'.

   * On x86 Linux, print the current query and thread (connection) id,
     if available, in the coredump handler.

   * Fixed several timing bugs in the test suite.

   * Extended `mysqltest' to take care of the timing issues in the test
     suite.

   * `ALTER TABLE' can now be used to change the definition for a
     `MERGE' table.

   * Fixed creation of `MERGE' tables on Windows.

   * Portability fixes for OpenBSD and OS2.

   * Added `--temp-pool' option to `mysqld'.  Using this option will
     cause most temporary files created to use a small set of names,
     rather than a unique name for each new file.  This is to work
     around a problem in the Linux kernel dealing with creating a bunch
     of new files with different names.  With the old behavior, Linux
     seems to "leak" memory, as it's being allocated to the directory
     entry cache instead of the disk cache.

--------------------------

   * Changed code to get around compiler bug in Compaq C++ on OSF1,
     that broke `BACKUP', `RESTORE', `CHECK', `REPAIR', and `ANALYZE
     TABLE'.

   * Added option `FULL' to `SHOW COLUMNS'. Now we show the privilege
     list for the columns only if this option is given.

   * Fixed bug in `SHOW LOGS' when there weren't any BDB logs.

   * Fixed a timing problem in replication that could delay sending an
     update to the client until a new update was done.

   * Don't convert field names when using `mysql_list_fields()'.  This
     is to keep this code compatible with `SHOW FIELDS'.

   * `MERGE' tables didn't work on Windows.

   * Fixed problem with `SET PASSWORD=...' on Windows.

   * Added missing `my_config.h' to RPM distribution.

   * `TRIM("foo" from "foo")' didn't return an empty string.

   * Added `--with-version-suffix' to `configure'.

   * Fixed coredump when client aborted connection without
     `mysql_close()'.

   * Fixed a bug in `RESTORE TABLE' when trying to restore from a
     non-existent directory.

   * Fixed a bug which caused a core dump on the slave when replicating
     `SET PASSWORD'.

   * Added `MASTER_POS_WAIT()'.

Changes in release 3.23.31
--------------------------

   * The test suite now tests all reachable BDB interface code.  During
     testing we found and fixed many errors in the interface code.

   * Using `HAVING' on an empty table could produce one result row when
     it shouldn't.

   * Fixed that the MySQL RPM is not dependent on Perl5 anymore.

   * Fixed some problems with `HEAP' tables on Windows.

   * `SHOW TABLE STATUS' didn't show correct average row length for
     tables larger than 4G.

   * `CHECK TABLE ... EXTENDED' didn't check row links for fixed size
     tables.

   * Added option `MEDIUM' to `CHECK TABLE'.

   * Fixed problem when using `DECIMAL()' keys on negative numbers.

   * `HOUR()' (and some other `TIME' functions) on a `CHAR' column
     always returned `NULL'.

   * Fixed security bug in something (please upgrade if you are using a
     earlier MySQL 3.23 version).

   * Fixed buffer overflow bug when writing a certain error message.

   * Added usage of `setrlimit()' on Linux to get `-O
     --open-files-limit=#' to work on Linux.

   * Added new `mysqld' variable: `bdb_version'.

   * Fixed bug when using expression of type:
          SELECT ... FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (t1.a=t2.a) WHERE t1.a=t2.a
     In this case the test in the `WHERE' clause was wrongly optimized
     away.

   * Fixed bug in `MyISAM' when deleting keys with possible `NULL'
     values, but the first key-column was not a prefix-compressed text
     column.

   * Fixed `mysql.server' to read the `mysql.server' option section
     instead of `mysql_server'.

   * Fixed `safe_mysqld' and `mysql.server' to also read the `server'
     option section.

   * Added `Threads_created' status variable to `mysqld'.

Changes in release 3.23.30
--------------------------

   * Added `SHOW OPEN TABLES' command.

   * Fixed that `myisamdump' works against old `mysqld' servers.

   * Fixed `myisamchk -k#' so that it works again.

   * Fixed a problem with replication when the binary log file went
     over 2G on 32-bit systems.

   * `LOCK TABLES' will now automatically start a new transaction.

   * Changed `BDB' tables to not use internal subtransactions and reuse
     open files to get more speed.

   * Added option `--mysqld=#' to `safe_mysqld'.

   * Allow hex constants in the `--fields-*-by' and
     `--lines-terminated-by' options to `mysqldump' and `mysqlimport'.
     By Paul DuBois.

   * Added option `--safe-show-database' to `mysqld'.

   * Added `have_bdb', `have_gemini', `have_innobase', `have_raid' and
     `have_ssl' to `SHOW VARIABLES' to make it easy to test for
     supported extensions.

   * Added option `--open-files-limit' to `mysqld'.

   * Changed option `--open-files' to `--open-files-limit' in
     `safe_mysqld'.

   * Fixed a bug where some rows were not found with `HEAP' tables that
     had many keys.

   * Fixed that `--bdb-no-sync' works.

   * Changed `--bdb-recover' to `--bdb-no-recover' as recover should be
     on by default.

   * Changed the default number of BDB locks to 10000.

   * Fixed a bug from 3.23.29 when allocating the shared structure
     needed for BDB tables.

   * Changed `mysqld_multi.sh' to use configure variables. Patch by
     Christopher McCrory.

Changes in release 3.23.29
--------------------------

   * Configure updates for Tru64, large file support, and better TCP
     wrapper support. By Albert Chin-A-Young.

   * Fixed bug in `<=>' operator.

   * Fixed bug in `REPLACE' with BDB tables.

   * `LPAD()' and `RPAD()' will shorten the result string if it's longer
     than the length argument.

   * Added `SHOW LOGS' command.

   * Remove not used BDB logs on shutdown.

   * When creating a table, put `PRIMARY' keys first, followed by
     `UNIQUE' keys.

   * Fixed a bug in `UPDATE' involving multi-part keys where one
     specified all key parts both in the update and the `WHERE' part. In
     this case MySQL could try to update a record that didn't match the
     whole `WHERE' part.

   * Changed drop table to first drop the tables and then the `.frm'
     file.

   * Fixed a bug in the hostname cache which caused `mysqld' to report
     the hostname as `''' in some error messages.

   * Fixed a bug with `HEAP' type tables; the variable
     `max_heap_table_size' wasn't used. Now either `MAX_ROWS' or
     `max_heap_table_size' can be used to limit the size of a `HEAP'
     type table.

   * Changed the default server-id to 1 for masters and 2 for slaves to
     make it easier to use the binary log.

   * Renamed variable `bdb_lock_max' to `bdb_max_lock'.

   * Added support for `auto_increment' on sub-fields for BDB tables.

   * Added `ANALYZE' of BDB tables.

   * In BDB tables, we now store the number of rows; This helps to
     optimize queries when we need an approximation of the number of
     rows.

   * If we get an error in a multi-row statement, we now only rollback
     the last statement, not the entire transaction.

   * If you do a `ROLLBACK' when you have updated a non-transactional
     table you will get an error as a warning.

   * Added option `--bdb-shared-data' to `mysqld'.

   * Added status variable `Slave_open_temp_tables'.

   * Added variables `binlog_cache_size' and `max_binlog_cache_size' to
     `mysqld'.

   * `DROP TABLE', `RENAME TABLE', `CREATE INDEX' and `DROP INDEX' are
     now transaction endpoints.

   * If you do a `DROP DATABASE' on a symbolic linked database, both
     the link and the original database is deleted.

   * Fixed that `DROP DATABASE' works on OS/2.

   * Fixed bug when doing a `SELECT DISTINCT ... table1 LEFT JOIN
     table2 ...' when table2 was empty.

   * Added `--abort-slave-event-count' and
     `--disconnect-slave-event-count' options to `mysqld' for debugging
     and testing of replication.

   * Fixed replication of temporary tables. Handles everything except
     slave server restart.

   * `SHOW KEYS' now shows whether or not key is `FULLTEXT'.

   * New script `mysqld_multi'. *Note `mysqld_multi': mysqld_multi.

   * Added new script, `mysql-multi.server.sh'.  Thanks to Tim Bunce
     <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk> for modifying `mysql.server' to easily handle
     hosts running many `mysqld' processes.

   * `safe_mysqld', `mysql.server', and `mysql_install_db' have been
     modified to use `mysql_print_defaults' instead of various hacks to
     read the `my.cnf' files.  In addition, the handling of various
     paths has been made more consistent with how `mysqld' handles them
     by default.

   * Automatically remove Berkeley DB transaction logs that no longer
     are in use.

   * Fixed bug with several `FULLTEXT' indexes in one table.

   * Added a warning if number of rows changes on `REPAIR'/`OPTIMIZE'.

   * Applied patches for OS/2 by `Yuri Dario'.

   * `FLUSH TABLES table_name' didn't always flush the index tree to
     disk properly.

   * `--bootstrap' is now run in a separate thread. This fixes a problem
     that caused `mysql_install_db' to core dump on some Linux machines.

   * Changed `mi_create()' to use less stack space.

   * Fixed bug with optimizer trying to over-optimize `MATCH' when used
     with `UNIQUE' key.

   * Changed `crash-me' and the MySQL benchmarks to also work with
     FrontBase.

   * Allow `RESTRICT' and `CASCADE' after `DROP TABLE' to make porting
     easier.

   * Reset status variable which could cause problem if one used
     `--slow-log'.

   * Added variable `connect_timeout' to `mysql' and `mysqladmin'.

   * Added `connect_timeout' as an alias for `timeout' for option files
     read by `mysql_options()'.

Changes in release 3.23.28
--------------------------

   * Added new options `--pager[=...]', `--no-pager', `--tee=...' and
     `--no-tee' to the `mysql' client.  The new corresponding
     interactive commands are `pager', `nopager', `tee' and `notee'.
     *Note `mysql': mysql, `mysql --help' and the interactive help for
     more information.

   * Fixed crash when automatic repair of `MyISAM' table failed.

   * Fixed a major performance bug in the table locking code when one
     constantly had a LOT of `SELECT', `UPDATE' and `INSERT' statements
     running. The symptom was that the `UPDATE' and `INSERT' queries
     were locked for a long time while new `SELECT' statements were
     executed before the updates.

   * When reading `options_files' with `mysql_options()' the
     `return-found-rows' option was ignored.

   * One can now specify `interactive-timeout' in the option file that
     is read by `mysql_options()'. This makes it possible to force
     programs that run for a long time (like `mysqlhotcopy') to use
     `interactive_timeout' instead of `wait_timeout'.

   * Added to the slow query log the time and the user name for each
     logged query. If you are using `--log-long-format' then also
     queries that do not use an index are logged, even if the query
     takes less than `long_query_time' seconds.

   * Fixed a problem in `LEFT JOIN' which caused all columns in a
     reference table to be `NULL'.

   * Fixed a problem when using `NATURAL JOIN' without keys.

   * Fixed a bug when using a multi-part keys where the first part was
     of type `TEXT' or `BLOB'.

   * `DROP' of temporary tables wasn't stored in the update/binary log.

   * Fixed a bug where `SELECT DISTINCT * ... LIMIT #' only returned
     one row.

   * Fixed a bug in the assembler code in `strstr()' for sparc and
     cleaned up the `global.h' header file to avoid a problem with bad
     aliasing with the compiler submitted with RedHat 7.0. (Reported by
     Trond Eivind Glomsrd)

   * The option `--skip-networking' now works properly on NT.

   * Fixed a long outstanding bug in the `ISAM' tables when a row with
     a length of more than 65K was shortened by a single byte.

   * Fixed a bug in `MyISAM' when running multiple updating processes on
     the same table.

   * Allow one to use `FLUSH TABLE tablename'.

   * Added `--replicate-ignore-table', `--replicate-do-table',
     `--replicate-wild-ignore-table', `--replicate-wild-do-table'.

   * Changed all log files to use our own `IO_CACHE' mechanism instead
     of `FILE' to avoid OS problems when there are many files open.

   * Added options `--open-files' and `--timezone' to `safe_mysqld'.

   * Fixed a fatal bug in `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... SELECT ...'.

   * Fixed a problem with `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT NULL'.

   * Added variables `large_file_support',`net_read_timeout',
     `net_write_timeout' and `query_buffer_size' to `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Added status variables `created_tmp_files' and `sort_merge_passes'
     to `SHOW STATUS'.

   * Fixed a bug where we didn't allow an index name after the `FOREIGN
     KEY' definition.

   * Added `TRUNCATE table_name' as a synonym for `DELETE FROM
     table_name'.

   * Fixed a bug in a BDB key compare function when comparing part keys.

   * Added variable `bdb_lock_max' to `mysqld'.

   * Added more tests to the benchmark suite.

   * Fixed an overflow bug in the client code when using overly long
     database names.

   * `mysql_connect()' now aborts on Linux if the server doesn't answer
     in `timeout' seconds.

   * `SLAVE START' did not work if you started with
     `--skip-slave-start' and had not explicitly run `CHANGE MASTER TO'.

   * Fixed the output of `SHOW MASTER STATUS' to be consistent with
     `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'. (It now has no directory in the log name.)

   * Added `PURGE MASTER LOGS TO'.

   * Added `SHOW MASTER LOGS'.

   * Added `--safemalloc-mem-limit' option to `mysqld' to simulate
     memory shortage when compiled `--with-debug=full'.

   * Fixed several coredumps in out-of-memory conditions.

   * `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' was using an uninitialized mutex if the slave
     had not been started yet.

   * Fixed bug in `ELT()' and `MAKE_SET()' when the query used a
     temporary table.

   * `CHANGE MASTER TO' without specifying `MASTER_LOG_POS' would set
     it to 0 instead of 4 and hit the magic number in the master binlog.

   * `ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ...' syntax added.  This will create the
     new table with the rows in a specific order.

--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug where the automatic repair of MyISAM tables sometimes
     failed when the data file was corrupt.

   * Fixed a bug in `SHOW CREATE' when using `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns.

   * Changed BDB tables to use new compare function in Berkeley DB
     3.2.3.

   * You can now use Unix sockets with `mit-pthreads'.

   * Added the latin5 (turkish) character set.

   * Small portability fixes.

Changes in release 3.23.26
--------------------------

   * Fixed `<>' to work properly with `NULL'.

   * Fixed a problem with `SUBSTRING_INDEX()' and `REPLACE()'.  (Patch
     by Alexander Igonitchev)

   * Fix `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS' not to give an error if
     the table exists.

   * If you don't create a `PRIMARY KEY' in a BDB table, a hidden
     `PRIMARY KEY' will be created.

   * Added read-only-key optimization to BDB tables.

   * `LEFT JOIN' in some cases preferred a full table scan when there
     was no `WHERE' clause.

   * When using `--log-slow-queries', don't count the time waiting for
     a lock.

   * Fixed bug in lock code on Windows which could cause the key cache
     to report that the key file was crashed even if it was okay.

   * Automatic repair of `MyISAM' tables if you start `mysqld' with
     `--myisam-recover'.

   * Removed the `TYPE=' keyword from `CHECK' and `REPAIR'. Allow
     `CHECK' options to be combined. (You can still use `TYPE=' but
     this usage is deprecated.)

   * Fixed mutex bug in the binary replication log - long update
     queries could be read only in part by the slave if it did it at
     the wrong time, which was not fatal, but resulted in a
     performance-degrading reconnect and a scary message in the error
     log.

   * Changed the format of the binary log - added magic number, server
     version, binlog version. Added server id and query error code for
     each query event.

   * Replication thread from the slave now will kill all the stale
     threads from the same server.

   * Long replication user names were not being handled properly.

   * Added `--replicate-rewrite-db' option to `mysqld'.

   * Added `--skip-slave-start' option to `mysqld'.

   * Updates that generated an error code (such as `INSERT INTO
     foo(some_key) values (1),(1)') erroneously terminated the slave
     thread.

   * Added optimization of queries where `DISTINCT' is only used on
     columns from some of the tables.

   * Allow floating-point numbers where there is no sign after the
     exponent (like 1e1).

   * `SHOW GRANTS' didn't always show all column grants.

   * Added `--default-extra-file=#' to all MySQL clients.

   * Columns referenced in `INSERT' statements now are initialized
     properly.

   * `UPDATE' didn't always work when used with a range on a timestamp
     that was part of the key that was used to find rows.

   * Fixed a bug in `FULLTEXT' index when inserting a `NULL' column.

   * Changed to use `mkstemp()' instead of `tempnam()'. Based on a
     patch from John Jones.

Changes in release 3.23.25
--------------------------

   * Fixed that `databasename' works as second argument to
     `mysqlhotcopy'.

   * `UMASK' and `UMASK_DIR' can now be specified in octal.

   * Added `RIGHT JOIN'. This makes `RIGHT' a reserved word.

   * Added `@@IDENTITY' as a synonym for `LAST_INSERT_ID()'.  (This is
     for Visual Basic compatibility.)

   * Fixed a bug in `myisamchk' and `REPAIR' when using `FULLTEXT'
     index.

   * `LOAD DATA INFILE' now works with FIFOs.  (Patch by Toni L.
     Harbaugh-Blackford.)

   * `FLUSH LOGS' broke replication if you specified a log name with an
     explicit extension as the value of the `log-bin' option.

   * Fixed a bug in `MyISAM' with packed multi-part keys.

   * Fixed crash when using `CHECK TABLE' on Windows.

   * Fixed a bug where `FULLTEXT' index always used the koi8_ukr
     character set.

   * Fixed privilege checking for `CHECK TABLE'.

   * The `MyISAM' repair/reindex code didn't use the `--tempdir' option
     for its temporary files.

   * Added `BACKUP TABLE/RESTORE TABLE'.

   * Fixed coredump on `CHANGE MASTER TO' when the slave did not have
     the master to start with.

   * Fixed incorrect `Time' in the processlist for `Connect' of the
     slave thread.

   * The slave now logs when it connects to the master.

   * Fixed a core dump bug when doing `FLUSH MASTER' if you didn't
     specify a filename argument to `--log-bin'.

   * Added missing `ha_berkeley.x' files to the MySQL Windows

   * Fixed some mutex bugs in the log code that could cause thread
     blocks if new log files couldn't be created.

   * Added lock time and number of selected processed rows to slow
     query log.

   * Added `--memlock' option to `mysqld' to lock `mysqld' in memory on
     systems with the `mlockall()' call (like in Solaris).

   * `HEAP' tables didn't use keys properly. (Bug from 3.23.23.)

   * Added better support for `MERGE' tables (keys, mapping, creation,
     documentation...). *Note MERGE::.

   * Fixed bug in `mysqldump' from 3.23 which caused some `CHAR' columns
     not to be quoted.

   * Merged `analyze', `check', `optimize' and repair code.

   * `OPTIMIZE TABLE' is now mapped to `REPAIR' with statistics and
     sorting of the index tree.  This means that for the moment it only
     works on `MyISAM' tables.

   * Added a pre-alloced block to root_malloc to get fewer mallocs.

   * Added a lot of new statistics variables.

   * Fixed `ORDER BY' bug with BDB tables.

   * Removed warning that `mysqld' couldn't remove the `.pid' file
     under Windows.

   * Changed `--log-isam' to log *MyISAM* tables instead of isam tables.

   * Fixed `CHECK TABLE' to work on Windows.

   * Added file mutexes to make `pwrite()' safe on Windows.

Changes in release 3.23.24
--------------------------

   * Added `mysqld' variable `created_tmp_disk_tables'.

   * To make it possible to reliably dump and restore tables with
     `TIMESTAMP(X)' columns, MySQL now reports columns with `X' other
     than 14 or 8 to be strings.

   * Changed sort order for latin1 as it was before MySQL Version
     3.23.23.  Any table with `CHAR' columns that may have characters
     with ASCII values greater than 128 that was created or modified
     with 3.23.22 must be repaired!

   * Fixed small memory leak introduced from 3.23.22 when creating a
     temporary table.

   * Fixed problem with BDB tables and reading on a unique (not
     primary) key.

   * Restored the win1251 character set (it's now only marked
     deprecated).

Changes in release 3.23.23
--------------------------

   * Changed sort order for 'German';  All tables created with 'German'
     sortorder must be repaired with `REPAIR TABLE' or `myisamchk'
     before use!

   * Added option `--core-file' to `mysqld' to get a core file on Linux
     if `mysqld' dies on the SIGSEGV signal.

   * MySQL client `mysql' now starts with option `--no-named-commands'
     (`-g') by default. This option can be disabled with
     `--enable-named-commands' (`-G'). This may cause incompatibility
     problems in some cases, for example, in SQL scripts that use named
     commands without a semicolon, etc. !  Long format commands still
     work from the first line.

   * Fixed a problem when using many pending `DROP TABLE' statements at
     the same time.

   * Optimizer didn't use keys properly when using `LEFT JOIN' on an
     empty table.

   * Added shorter help text when invoking `mysqld' with incorrect
     options.

   * Fixed non-fatal `free()' bug in `mysqlimport'.

   * Fixed bug in `MyISAM' index handling of `DECIMAL'/`NUMERIC' keys.

   * Fixed a bug in concurrent insert in `MyISAM' tables; In some
     contexts, usage of `MIN(key_part)' or `MAX(key_part)' returned an
     empty set.

   * Updated `mysqlhotcopy' to use the new `FLUSH TABLES table_list'
     syntax. Only tables which are being backed up are flushed now.

   * Changed behavior of `--enable-thread-safe-client' so that both
     non-threaded (`-lmysqlclient') and threaded (`-lmysqlclient_r')
     libraries are built.  Users who linked against a threaded
     `-lmysqlclient' will need to link against `libmysqlclient_r' now.

   * Added atomic `RENAME' command.

   * Don't count entries with `NULL' in `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)'.

   * Changed `ALTER TABLE', `LOAD DATA INFILE' on empty tables and
     `INSERT ... SELECT ...' on empty tables to create non-unique
     indexes in a separate batch with sorting. This will make the above
     calls much faster when you have many indexes.

   * `ALTER TABLE' now logs the first used insert_id correctly.

   * Fixed crash when adding a default value to a `BLOB' column.

   * Fixed a bug with `DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB' where it returned a datetime
     instead of a date.

   * Fixed a problem with the thread cache which made some threads show
     up as `***DEAD***' in `SHOW PROCESSLIST'.

   * Fixed a lock in our thr_rwlock code, which could make selects that
     run at the same time as concurrent inserts crash. This only
     affects systems that don't have the `pthread_rwlock_rdlock' code.

   * When deleting rows with a non-unique key in a HEAP table, all rows
     weren't always deleted.

   * Fixed bug in range optimizer for HEAP tables for searches on a
     part index.

   * Fixed that `SELECT' on part keys works with BDB tables.

   * Fixed `INSERT INTO bdb_table ... SELECT' to work with BDB tables.

   * `CHECK TABLE' now updates key statistics for the table.

   * `ANALYZE TABLE' will now only update tables that have been changed
     since thee last `ANALYZE'. Note that this is a new feature and
     tables will not be marked to be analyzed until they are updated in
     any way with 3.23.23 or newer.  For older tables, you have to do
     `CHECK TABLE' to update the key distribution.

   * Fixed some minor privilege problems with `CHECK', `ANALYZE',
     `REPAIR' and `SHOW CREATE' commands.

   * Added `CHANGE MASTER TO' command.

   * Added `FAST', `QUICK' `EXTENDED' check types to `CHECK TABLES'.

   * Changed `myisamchk' so that `--fast' and `--check-changed-tables'
     are also honored with `--sort-index' and `--analyze'.

   * Fixed fatal bug in `LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER' that did not lock the
     table during index re-build.

   * `LOAD DATA INFILE' broke replication if the database was excluded
     from replication.

   * More variables in `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' and `SHOW MASTER STATUS'.

   * `SLAVE STOP' now will not return until the slave thread actually
     exits.

   * Full text search via the `MATCH' function and `FULLTEXT' index
     type.  (For MyISAM files).  This makes `FULLTEXT' a reserved word.

     connection is closed unexpectedly.

   * Added workaround for a bug in `gcc' 2.96 (intel) and `gcc' 2.9
     (Ia64) in `gen_lex_hash.c'.

   * Fixed memory leak in the client library when using `host=' in the
     `my.cnf' file.

   * Optimized functions that manipulate the hours/minutes/seconds.

   * Fixed bug when comparing the result of `DATE_ADD()'/`DATE_SUB()'
     against a number.

   * Fixed `chown' warning in `safe_mysqld'.

   * Fixed a bug in `ORDER BY' that was introduced in 3.23.19.

   * Only optimize the `DELETE FROM tbl_name' to do a drop+create of
     the table if we are in `AUTOCOMMIT' mode.  (Needed for BDB tables).

   * Added extra checks to avoid index corruption when the
     `ISAM'/`MyISAM' index files gets full during an `INSERT'/`UPDATE'.

   * `myisamchk' didn't correctly update row checksum when used with
     `-ro' (This only gave an warning in subsequent runs).

   * Fixed bug in `REPAIR TABLE' so that it works with tables without
     indexes.

   * Fixed buffer overrun in `DROP DATABASE'

   * `LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER' is sufficiently bug-free to announce it as
     a feature.

     table when doing update based on key on a table with many keys and
     some key changed values.

   * The Linux MySQL RPM's and binaries are now statically linked with
     a linuxthread version that has faster mutex handling when used with
     MySQL.

     needs to be sorted.

   * Changed name of `print_defaults' to `my_print_defaults' to avoid
     name confusion.

   * Fixed `NULLIF()' to work according to ANSI SQL99.

Changes in release 3.23.17
--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug in `find_in_set()' when the first argument was `NULL'.

   * Added table locks to Berkeley DB.

   * Fixed a bug with `LEFT JOIN' and `ORDER BY' where the first table
     had only one matching row.

   * Added 4 sample `my.cnf' example files in the `support-files'
     directory.

     bug was probably introduced in 3.23.15).

   * Changed syntax for `INNER JOIN' to match ANSI SQL.

   * Added `NATURAL JOIN' syntax.

   * A lot of fixes in the `BDB' interface.

     mode.

   * Added symbolic links support for Windows.

   * Changed protocol to let client know if the server is in AUTOCOMMIT
     mode and if there is a pending transaction.  If there is a pending
     transaction the client library will give an error before
     reconnecting to the server to let the client know that the server
     did a rollback.  The protocol is still backward compatible with
     old clients

   * Fixed bug in `REPAIR TABLE' when the table was in use by other
     threads.

   * Added a thread cache to make it possible to debug MySQL with `gdb'
     when one does a lot of reconnects. This will also improve systems
     where you can't use persistent connections.

   * Lots of fixes in the Berkeley DB interface.

   * `UPDATE IGNORE' will not abort if an update results in a
     `DUPLICATE_KEY' error.

Changes in release 3.23.15
--------------------------

   * To start `mysqld' as `root', you must now use the `--user=root'
     option.

   * Added interface to Berkeley DB. (This is not yet functional;  Play
     with it at your own risk!)

   * Replication between master and slaves.

   * Fixed bug that other threads could steal a lock when a thread had
     a lock on a table and did a `FLUSH TABLES' command.

   * Added the `slow_launch_time' variable and the `Slow_launch_threads'
     status variable to `mysqld'.  These can be examined with
     `mysqladmin variables' and `mysqladmin extended-status'.

   * Added functions `INET_NTOA()' and `INET_ATON()'.

   * The default type of `IF()' now depends on the second and third
     arguments and not only on the second argument.

   * Fixed case when `myisamchk' could go into a loop when trying to
     repair a crashed table.

   * Don't write `INSERT DELAYED' to update log if `SQL_LOG_UPDATE=0'.

   * Fixed problem with `REPLACE' on `HEAP' tables.

   * Added possible character sets and time zone to `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Fixed bug in locking code that could result it locking problems
     with concurrent inserts under high load.

   * Fixed a problem with `DELETE' of many rows on a table with
     compressed keys where MySQL scanned the index to find the rows.

   * Fixed problem with `CHECK' on table with deleted keyblocks.

   * Fixed a bug in reconnect (at the client side) where it didn't free
     memory properly in some contexts.

   * Fixed problems in update log when using `LAST_INSERT_ID()' to
     update a table with an auto_increment key.

   * Added function `NULLIF()'.

   * Fixed bug when using `LOAD DATA INFILE' on a table with
     `BLOB/TEXT' columns.

   * Optimised MyISAM to be faster when inserting keys in sorted order.

   * `EXPLAIN SELECT ...' now also prints out whether MySQL needs to
     create a temporary table or use file sorting when resolving the
     `SELECT'.

   * Added optimization to skip `ORDER BY' parts where the part is a
     constant expression in the `WHERE' part.  Indexes can now be used
     even if the `ORDER BY' doesn't match the index exactly, as long as
     all the not used index parts and all the extra `ORDER BY' columns
     are constants in the `WHERE' clause.  *Note MySQL indexes::.

   * `UPDATE' and `DELETE' on a whole unique key in the `WHERE' part,
     is now faster than before.

   * Changed `RAID_CHUNKSIZE' to be in 1024 byte increments.

   * Fixed coredump in LOAD_FILE(NULL).

Changes in release 3.23.14
--------------------------

   * Fixed a bug in `CONCAT()' where one of the arguments was a function
     that returned a modified argument.

   * Fixed a critical bug in `myisamchk', where it updated the header in
     the index file when one only checked the table.  This confused the
     `mysqld' daemon if it updated the same table at the same time. Now
     the status in the index file is only updated if one uses
     `--update-state'.  With older `myisamchk' versions you should use
     `--read-only' when only checking tables, if there is the slightest
     chance that the `mysqld' server is working on the table at the
     same time!

   * Fixed that `DROP TABLE' is logged in the update log.

   * Fixed problem when searching on `DECIMAL()' key field where the
     column data contained leading zeros.

   * Fix bug in `myisamchk' when the auto_increment isn't the first key.

   * Allow `DATETIME' in ISO8601 format: 2000-03-12T12:00:00

   * Dynamic character sets.  A `mysqld' binary can now handle many
     different character sets (you can choose which when starting
     `mysqld').

   * Added command `REPAIR TABLE'.

   * Added C API function `mysql_thread_safe()'.

   * Added the `UMASK_DIR' environment variable.

   * Added function `CONNECTION_ID()'.

   * When using `=' on `BLOB' or `VARCHAR BINARY' keys, where only a
     part of the column was indexed, the whole column of the result row
     wasn't compared.

   * Fix for sjis character set and `ORDER BY'.

   * When running in ANSI mode, don't allow columns to be used that
     aren't in the `GROUP BY' part.

Changes in release 3.23.13
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem when doing locks on the same table more than 2 times
     in the same `LOCK TABLE' command; This fixed the problem one got
     when running the test-ATIS test with `--fast' or
     `--check-only-changed'.

   * Added option `SQL_BUFFER_RESULT' to `SELECT'.

   * Removed end space from double/float numbers in results from
     temporary tables.  Added `CHECK TABLE' command.

   * Added changes for MyISAM in 3.23.12 that didn't get into the source
     distribution because of CVS problems.

   * Fixed bug so that `mysqladmin shutdown' will wait for the local
     server to close down.

   * Fixed a possible endless loop when calculating timestamp.

   * Added `print_defaults' to the `.rpm' files. Removed `mysqlbug'
     from the client `.rpm' file.

--------------------------

   * Fixed bug in `MyISAM' involving `REPLACE ... SELECT ...' which
     could give a corrupted table.

   * Fixed bug in `myisamchk' where it wrongly reset the auto_increment
     value.

   * LOTS of patches for Linux Alpha. MySQL now appears to be relatively
     stable on Alpha.

   * Changed `DISTINCT' on `HEAP' temporary tables to use hashed keys
     to quickly find duplicated rows. This mostly concerns queries of
     type `SELECT DISTINCT ... GROUP BY ...'.  This fixes a problem
     where not all duplicates were removed in queries of the above
     type.  In addition, the new code is MUCH faster.

   * Added patches to make MySQL compile on Mac OS X.

   * Added option `IF NOT EXISTS' to `CREATE DATABASE'.

   * Added options `--all-databases' and `--databases' to `mysqldump'
     to allow dumping of many databases at the same time.

   * Fixed bug in compressed `DECIMAL()' index in `MyISAM' tables.

   * Fixed bug when storing 0 into a timestamp.

   * When doing `mysqladmin shutdown' on a local connection,
     `mysqladmin' now waits until the pidfile is gone before
     terminating.

   * Fixed core dump with some `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)' queries.

   * Fixed that `myisamchk' works properly with RAID:ed tables.

   * Fixed problem with `LEFT JOIN' and `key_field IS NULL'.

   * Fixed bug in `net_clear()' which could give the error `Aborted
     connection' in the MySQL clients.

   * Added options `USE INDEX (key_list)' and `IGNORE INDEX (key_list)'
     as join parameters in `SELECT'.

   * `DELETE' and `RENAME' should now work on `RAID' tables.

     OPTION'.

   * Removed extra `)' from the output of `SHOW GRANTS'

   * Fixed problem when storing numbers in timestamps.

   * Fix problem with timezones that have half hour offsets.

   * Allow the syntax `UNIQUE INDEX' in `CREATE' statements.

   * `mysqlhotcopy' - fast on-line hot-backup utility for local MySQL
     databases. By Tim Bunce.

   * Added variables `select_limit' and `max_join_size' to `mysql'.

   * Added sql variables: `SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE' and `SQL_SAFE_UPDATES'.

   * Added `READ LOCAL' lock that doesn't lock the table for concurrent
     inserts. (This is used by `mysqldump').

   * Changed that `LOCK TABLES ... READ' doesn't anymore allow
     concurrent inserts.

   * Added option `--skip-delay-key-write' to `mysqld'.

   * Fixed security problem in the protocol regarding password checking.

   * `_rowid' can now be used as an alias for an integer type unique
     indexed column.

   * Added back blocking of `SIGPIPE' when compiling with
     `--thread-safe-clients' to make things safe for old clients.

   * Fixed problem when only changing a 0 to `NULL' in a table with
     `BLOB/TEXT' columns.

   * Fixed bug in range optimizer when using many key parts and or on
     the middle key parts:  `WHERE K1=1 and K3=2 and (K2=2 and K4=4 or
     K2=3 and K4=5)'

   * Added command `source' to `mysql' to allow reading of batch files
     inside the `mysql' client.  Original patch by Matthew Vanecek.

   * Fixed critical problem with the `WITH GRANT OPTION' option.

   * Don't give an unnecessary `GRANT' error when using tables from many
     databases in the same query.

   * Added VIO wrapper (needed for SSL support ; By Andrei Errapart and
     Tnu Samuel).

   * Fixed optimizer problem on `SELECT' when using many overlapping
     indexes.  MySQL should now be able to choose keys even better when
     there is many keys to choose from.

   * Changed optimizer to prefer a range key instead of a ref key when
     the range key can uses more columns than the ref key (which only
     can use columns with =).  For example, the following type of
     queries should now be faster: `SELECT * from key_part_1=const and
     key_part_2 > const2'

   * Fixed bug that a change of all `VARCHAR' columns to `CHAR' columns
     didn't change row type from dynamic to fixed.

   * Disabled floating-point exceptions for FreeBSD to fix core dump
     when doing `SELECT floor(pow(2,63))'.

   * Changed `mysqld' startup option `--delay-key-write' to
     `--delay-key-write-for-all-tables'

   * Added `read-next-on-key' to `HEAP' tables.  This should fix all
     problems with `HEAP' tables when using not `UNIQUE' keys.

   * Added print of default arguments options to all clients.

   * Added `--log-slow-queries' to `mysqld' to log all queries that
     take a long time to a separate log file with a time of how long
     the query took.

   * Fixed core dump when doing `WHERE key_column=RAND(...)'

   * Fixed optimization bug in `SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... key_column IS
     NULL', when `key_column' could contain `NULL' values.

   * Fixed problem with 8-bit characters as separators in `LOAD DATA
     INFILE'.

-------------------------

   * Fixed workaround under Linux to avoid problems with
     `pthread_mutex_timedwait', which is used with `INSERT DELAYED'.
     *Note Linux::.

   * Fixed that one will get a 'disk full' error message if one gets
     disk full when doing sorting (instead of waiting until we got more
     disk space).

   * In `MyISAM' one can now do an `INSERT' at the same time as other
     threads are reading from the table.

   * Changed to use snprintf() when printing floats to avoid some buffer
     overflows on FreeBSD.

   * Made `[floor()' overflow safe on FreeBSD.

   * Added option `--quote-names' to `mysqldump'

   * Fixed bug that one could make a part of a `PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL'.

   * Added `mysql_odbc_escape_string()' function to support big5
     characters in MyODBC.

   * Rewrote the table handler to use classes.  This introduces a lot
     of new code, but will make table handling faster and better.

   * Added patch by Sasha for user-defined variables.

   * Changed that `FLOAT' and `DOUBLE' (without any length modifiers)
     are not anymore fixed decimal point numbers.

   * Changed the meaning of `FLOAT(X)': Now this is the same as `FLOAT'
     if X <= 24 and a `DOUBLE' if 24 < X <= 53.

   * `DECIMAL(X)' is now an alias for `DECIMAL(X,0)' and `DECIMAL' is
     now an alias for `DECIMAL(10,0)'.  The same goes for `NUMERIC'.

   * Added option `ROW_FORMAT={default | dynamic | static |
     compressed}' to `CREATE_TABLE'.

   * `DELETE FROM table_name' didn't work on temporary tables.

   * Changed function `CHAR_LENGTH()' to be multi-byte character safe.

Changes in release 3.23.5
-------------------------

   * Fixed some Y2K problems in the new date handling in 3.23.

   * Fixed problem with `SELECT DISTINCT ... ORDER BY RAND()'.

   * Added patches by Sergei A. Golubchik for text searching on the
     MyISAM level.

   * Fixed cache overflow problem when using full joins without keys.

   * Fixed some configure issues.

   * Some small changes to make parsing faster.

   * `ALTER TABLE' + adding a column after the last field didn't work.

   * Fixed problem when using an auto_increment column in two keys

   * One can now with MyISAM have the auto_increment part as a sub part:
     `CREATE TABLE foo (a int not null auto_increment, b char(5),
     primary key (b,a))'

   * Fixed bug in MyISAM with packed char keys that could be `NULL'.

   * `AS' on fieldname with `CREATE TABLE table_name SELECT ...' didn't
     work.

   * Allow use of `NATIONAL' and `NCHAR' when defining character
     columns.  This is the same as not using `BINARY'.

   * Don't allow `NULL' columns in a `PRIMARY KEY' (only in `UNIQUE'
     keys).

   * Clear `LAST_INSERT_ID' if one uses this in ODBC: `WHERE
     auto_increment_column IS NULL'.  This seems to fix some problems
     with Access.

   * `SET SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0|1' now turns on/off the handling of
     searching after the last inserted row with `WHERE
     auto_increment_column IS NULL'.

   * Added new `mysqld' variable `concurrency' for Solaris.

   * Added option `--relative' to `mysqladmin' to make
     `extended-status' more useful to monitor changes.

   * Fixed bug when using `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)' on an empty table.

   * Added support for the Chinese character set GBK.

   * Fixed problem with `LOAD DATA INFILE' and `BLOB' columns.

Changes in release 3.23.4
-------------------------

   * Inserting a `DATETIME' into a `TIME' column will not anymore try
     to store 'days' in it.

   * Fixed problem with storage of float/double on little endian
     machines.  (This affected `SUM()'.)

   * Added connect timeout on TCP/IP connections.

   * Fixed problem with `LIKE' "%" on an index that may have `NULL'
     values.

   * `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES' didn't revoke all privileges.

   * Allow creation of temporary tables with same name as the original
     table.

   * When granting a user a grant option for a database, he couldn't
     grant privileges to other users.

   * New command: `SHOW GRANTS FOR user' (by Sinisa).

   * New `date_add' syntax:  `date/datetime + INTERVAL # interval_type'.
     By Joshua Chamas.

   * Fixed privilege check for `LOAD DATA REPLACE'.

   * Automatic fixing of broken include files on Solaris 2.7

   * Some configure issues to fix problems with big file system
     detection.

   * Added `LIMIT' to `UPDATE'.

   * New client function: `mysql_change_user()'.

   * Added character set to `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Added support of `--[whitespace]' comments.

   * Allow `INSERT into tbl_name VALUES ()', that is, you may now
     specify an empty value list to insert a row in which each column
     is set to its default value.

   * Changed `SUBSTRING(text FROM pos)' to conform to ANSI SQL. (Before
     this construct returned the rightmost 'pos' characters).

   * `SUM()' with `GROUP BY' returned 0 on some systems.

   * Changed output for `SHOW TABLE STATUS'.

   * Added `DELAY_KEY_WRITE' option to `CREATE TABLE'.

   * Allow `AUTO_INCREMENT' on any key part.

   * Fixed problem with `YEAR(NOW())' and `YEAR(CURDATE())'.

   * Added `CASE' construct.

   * New function `COALESCE()'.

Changes in release 3.23.2
-------------------------

   * Fixed range optimizer bug: `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE
     key_part1 >= const AND (key_part2 = const OR key_part2 = const)'.
     The bug was that some rows could be duplicated in the result.

   * Running `myisamchk' without `-a' updated the index distribution
     wrong.

   * `SET SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1' gave parse error before.

   * You can now update indexes columns that are used in the `WHERE'
     clause.  `UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY > 100'

   * Date handling should now be a bit faster.

   * Added handling of fuzzy dates (dates where day or month is 0):
     (Like: 1999-01-00)

   * Fixed optimization of `SELECT ... WHERE key_part1=const1 AND
     key_part_2=const2 AND key_part1=const4 AND key_part2=const4' ;
     Indextype should be `range' instead of `ref'.

   * Fixed `egcs' 1.1.2 optimizer bug (when using `BLOB's) on Linux
     Alpha.

   * Fixed problem with `LOCK TABLES' combined with `DELETE FROM table'.

   * MyISAM tables now allow keys on `NULL' and `BLOB/TEXT' columns.

   * The following join is now much faster: `SELECT ... FROM t1 LEFT
     JOIN t2 ON ... WHERE t2.not_null_column IS NULL'.

   * `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' can be done on functions.

   * Changed handling of 'const_item' to allow handling of `ORDER BY
     RAND()'.

   * Indexes are now used for `WHERE key_column = function'.

   * Indexes are now used for `WHERE key_column = column_name' even if
     the columns are not identically packed.

   * Indexes are now used for `WHERE column_name IS NULL'.

   * Changed heap tables to be stored in low_byte_first order (to make
     it easy to convert to MyISAM tables)

   * Automatic change of HEAP temporary tables to MyISAM tables in case
     of 'table is full' errors.

   * Added option `--init-file=file_name' to `mysqld'.

   * `COUNT(DISTINCT value, [value, ...])'

   * `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE' now creates a temporary table, in its own
     namespace, that is automatically deleted if connection is dropped.

   * New reserved words (required for `CASE'):  `CASE, THEN, WHEN, ELSE
     and END'.

   * New functions `EXPORT_SET()' and `MD5()'.

   * Support for the GB2312 Chinese character set.

-------------------------

   * Fixed some compilation problems.


File: mysql.info,  Node: News-3.23.0,  Prev: News-3.23.1,  Up: News-3.23.x

Changes in release 3.23.0
-------------------------

   * A new table handler library (`MyISAM') with a lot of new features.
     *Note MyISAM::.

   * You can create in-memory `HEAP' tables which are extremely fast for
     lookups.

   * Support for big files (63 bit) on OSes that support big files.

   * New function `LOAD_FILE(filename)' to get the contents of a file
     as a string value.

   * New operator `<=>' which will act as `=' but will return TRUE if
     both arguments are `NULL'.  This is useful for comparing changes
     between tables.

   * Added the ODBC 3.0 `EXTRACT(interval FROM datetime)' function.

   * Columns defined as `FLOAT(X)' is not rounded on storage and may be
     in scientific notation (1.0 E+10) when retrieved.

   * `REPLACE' is now faster than before.

   * Changed `LIKE' character comparison to behave as `='; This means
     that `'e' LIKE 'e''' (if the line doesn't display correctly, the
     latter 'e' means a French 'e' with a dot above) is now true.

   * `SHOW TABLE STATUS' returns a lot of information about the tables.

   * Added `LIKE' to the `SHOW STATUS' command.

   * Added privilege column to `SHOW COLUMNS'.

   * Added columns `packed' and `comment' to `SHOW INDEX'.

   * Added comments to tables (with `CREATE TABLE ... COMMENT "xxx"').

   * Added `UNIQUE', as in `CREATE TABLE table_name (col int not null
     UNIQUE)'

   * New create syntax: `CREATE TABLE table_name SELECT ...'

   * New create syntax: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...'

   * Allow creation of `CHAR(0)' columns.

   * `DATE_FORMAT()' now requires `%' before any format character.

   * `DELAYED' is now a reserved word (sorry about that :( ).

   * An example procedure is added: `analyse', file: `sql_analyse.c'.
     This will describe the data in your query.  Try the following:
          SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max elements,[max memory]])

     This procedure is extremely useful when you want to check the data
     in your table!

   * `BINARY' cast to force a string to be compared case sensitively.

   * Added option `--skip-show-database' to `mysqld'.

   * Check if a row has changed in an `UPDATE' now also works with
     `BLOB'/`TEXT' columns.

   * Added the `INNER' join syntax.  *NOTE*:  This made `INNER' a
     reserved word!

   * Added support for netmasks to the hostname in the MySQL tables.
     You can specify a netmask using the `IP/NETMASK' syntax.

   * If you compare a `NOT NULL DATE/DATETIME' column with `IS NULL',
     this is changed to a compare against `0' to satisfy some ODBC
     applications.  (By <shreeve@uci.edu>).

   * `NULL IN (...)' now returns `NULL' instead of `0'.  This will
     ensure that `null_column NOT IN (...)' doesn't match `NULL' values.

   * Fix storage of floating-point values in `TIME' columns.

   * Changed parsing of `TIME' strings to be more strict.  Now the
     fractional second part is detected (and currently skipped). The
     following formats are supported:
    `[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]'

    `[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]'
   * Detect (and ignore) second fraction part from `DATETIME'.

   * Added the `LOW_PRIORITY' attribute to `LOAD DATA INFILE'.

   * The default index name now uses the same case as the used column
     name.

   * Changed default number of connections to 100.

   * Use bigger buffers when using `LOAD DATA INFILE'.

   * `DECIMAL(x,y)' now works according to ANSI SQL.

   * Added aggregate UDF functions. Thanks to Andreas F. Bobak
     <bobak@relog.ch> for this!

   * `LAST_INSERT_ID()' is now updated for `INSERT INTO ... SELECT'.

   * Some small changes to the join table optimizer to make some joins
     faster.

   * `SELECT DISTINCT' is much faster; It uses the new `UNIQUE'
     functionality in `MyISAM'. One difference compared to MySQL
     Version 3.22 is that the output of `DISTINCT' is not sorted
     anymore.

   * All C client API macros are now functions to make shared libraries
     more reliable. Because of this, you can no longer call
     `mysql_num_fields()' on a `MYSQL' object, you must use
     `mysql_field_count()' instead.

   * Added use of `LIBEWRAP';  Patch by Henning P . Schmiedehausen.

   * Don't allow `AUTO_INCREMENT' for other than numerical columns.

   * Using `AUTO_INCREMENT' will now automatically make the column `NOT
     NULL'.

   * Show `NULL' as the default value for AUTO_INCREMENT columns.

   * Added `SQL_BIG_RESULT';  `SQL_SMALL_RESULT' is now default.

   * Added a shared library RPM. This enhancement was contributed by
     David Fox (dsfox@cogsci.ucsd.edu).

   * Added a `--enable-large-files/--disable-large-files' switch to
     `configure'. See `configure.in' for some systems where this is
     automatically turned off because of broken implementations.

   * Upgraded `readline' to 4.0.

   * New `CREATE TABLE' options: `PACK_KEYS' and `CHECKSUM'.

   * Added `mysqld' option `--default-table-type'.

   * Changed `configure' to not use big file handling on Linux as this
     crashes some RedHat 6.0 systems

Changes in release 3.22.23
--------------------------

   * Upgraded to use Autoconf 2.13, Automake 1.4 and `libtool' 1.3.2.

   * Better support for SCO in `configure'.

   * Added option `--defaults-file=###' to option file handling to
     force use of only one specific option file.

   * Extended `CREATE' syntax to ignore MySQL Version 3.23 keywords.

   * Fixed deadlock problem when using `INSERT DELAYED' on a table
     locked with `LOCK TABLES'.

   * Fixed deadlock problem when using `DROP TABLE' on a table that was
     locked by another thread.

   * Add logging of `GRANT/REVOKE' commands in the update log.

   * Fixed `isamchk' to detect a new error condition.

   * Fixed bug in `NATURAL LEFT JOIN'.

Changes in release 3.22.22
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem in the C API when you called `mysql_close()'
     directly after `mysql_init()'.

   * Better client error message when you can't open socket.

   * Fixed `delayed_insert_thread' counting when you couldn't create a
     new delayed_insert thread.

   * Fixed bug in `CONCAT()' with many arguments.

   * Added patches for DEC 3.2 and SCO.

   * Fixed path-bug when installing MySQL as a service on NT.

--------------------------

   * Fixed problem with `DELETE FROM TABLE' when table was locked by
     another thread.

   * Fixed bug in `LEFT JOIN' involving empty tables.

   * Changed the `mysql.db' column from `char(32)' to `char(60)'.

   * `MODIFY' and `DELAYED' are not reserved words anymore.

   * Fixed a bug when storing days in a `TIME' column.

   * Fixed a problem with `Host '...' is not allowed to connect to this
     MySQL server' after one had inserted a new MySQL user with a
     `GRANT' command.

   * Changed to use `TCP_NODELAY' also on Linux (Should give faster
     TCP/IP connections).

--------------------------

   * Fixed bug in `mysql_install_db' (from 3.22.17).

   * Changed default key cache size to 8M.

   * Fixed problem with queries that needed temporary tables with `BLOB'

Changes in release 3.22.18
--------------------------

   * Fixes a fatal problem in 3.22.17 on Linux;  After `shutdown' all
     threads didn't die properly.

   * Added option `-O flush_time=#' to `mysqld'.  This is mostly useful
     on Windows and tells how often MySQL should close all unused
     tables and flush all updated tables to disk.

   * Fixed problem that a `VARCHAR' column compared with `CHAR' column
     didn't use keys efficiently.

--------------------------

   * Fixed a core dump problem when using `--log-update' and connecting
     without a default database.

   * Fixed some `configure' and portability problems.

   * Using `LEFT JOIN' on tables that had circular dependencies caused
     `mysqld' to hang forever.

   * `mysqladmin processlist' could kill the server if a new user
     logged in.

   * `DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE key_column=col_name' didn't find any
     matching rows.  Fixed.

   * `DATE_ADD(column, ...)' didn't work.

   * `INSERT DELAYED' could deadlock with status 'upgrading lock'

   * Extended `ENCRYPT()' to take longer salt strings than 2 characters.

   * `longlong2str' is now much faster than before.  For `Intel x86'
     platforms, this function is written in optimized assembler.

   * Added the `MODIFY' keyword to `ALTER TABLE'.

Changes in release 3.22.15
--------------------------

   * `GRANT' used with `IDENTIFIED BY' didn't take effect until
     privileges were flushed.

   * Name change of some variables in `SHOW STATUS'.

   * Fixed problem with `ORDER BY' with 'only index' optimization when
     there were multiple key definitions for a used column.

   * `DATE' and `DATETIME' columns are now up to 5 times faster than
     before.

   * `INSERT DELAYED' can be used to let the client do other things
     while the server inserts rows into a table.

   * `LEFT JOIN USING (col1,col2)' didn't work if one used it with
     tables from 2 different databases.

   * `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE' didn't work in the Unix version because of
     a missing file.

   * Fixed problems with `VARCHAR'/`BLOB' on very short rows (< 4
     bytes); error 127 could occur when deleting rows.

   * Updating `BLOB/TEXT' through formulas didn't work for short (< 256
     char) strings.

   * When you did a `GRANT' on a new host, `mysqld' could die on the
     first connect from this host.

   * Fixed bug when one used `ORDER BY' on column name that was the same
     name as an alias.

   * Added `BENCHMARK(loop_count,expression)' function to time
     expressions.

Changes in release 3.22.14
--------------------------

   * Allow empty arguments to `mysqld' to make it easier to start from
     shell scripts.

   * Setting a `TIMESTAMP' column to `NULL' didn't record the timestamp
     value in the update log.

   * Fixed lock handler bug when one did `INSERT INTO TABLE ... SELECT
     ... GROUP BY'.

   * Added a patch for `localtime_r()' on Windows so that it will not
     crash anymore if your date is > 2039, but instead will return a
     time of all zero.

   * Names for user-defined functions are no longer case sensitive.

   * Added escape of `^Z' (ASCII 26) to `\Z' as `^Z' doesn't work with
     pipes on Windows.

   * `mysql_fix_privileges' adds a new column to the `mysql.func' to
     support aggregate UDF functions in future MySQL releases.

--------------------------

   * Saving `NOW()', `CURDATE()' or `CURTIME()' directly in a column
     didn't work.

   * `SELECT COUNT(*) ... LEFT JOIN ...' didn't work with no `WHERE'
     part.

   * Updated `config.guess' to allow MySQL to configure on UnixWare
     7.0.x.

   * Changed the implementation of `pthread_cond()' on the Windows
     version.  `get_lock()' now correctly times out on Windows!

--------------------------

   * Fixed problem when using `DATE_ADD()' and `DATE_SUB()' in a
     `WHERE' clause.

   * You can now set the password for a user with the `GRANT ... TO user
     IDENTIFIED BY 'password'' syntax.

   * Fixed bug in `GRANT' checking with `SELECT' on many tables.

   * Added missing file `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' to the RPM
     distribution. This is not run by default because it relies on the
     client package.

   * Added option `SQL_SMALL_RESULT' to `SELECT' to force use of fast
     temporary tables when you know that the result set will be small.

   * Allow use of negative real numbers without a decimal point.

   * Day number is now adjusted to maximum days in month if the
     resulting month after `DATE_ADD'/`DATE_SUB()' doesn't have enough
     days.

   * Fix that `GRANT' compares columns in case-insensitive fashion.

   * Fixed a bug in `sql_list.h' that made `ALTER TABLE' dump core in
     some contexts.

   * The hostname in `user@hostname' can now include `.' and `-'
     without quotes in the context of the `GRANT', `REVOKE' and `SET
     PASSWORD FOR ...' statements.

   * Fix for `isamchk' for tables which need big temporary files.

Changes in release 3.22.11
--------------------------

   * *IMPORTANT*: You must run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script
     when you upgrade to this version!  This is needed because of the
     new `GRANT' system. If you don't do this, you will get `Access
     denied' when you try to use `ALTER TABLE', `CREATE INDEX' or `DROP
     INDEX'.

   * `GRANT' to allow/deny users table and column access.

   * Changed `USER()' to return `user@host'

   * Changed the syntax for how to set `PASSWORD' for another user.

   * New command `FLUSH STATUS' that sets most status variables to zero.

   * New status variables: `aborted_threads', `aborted_connects'.

   * New option variable: `connection_timeout'.

   * Added support for Thai sorting (by Pruet Boonma
     <pruet@ds90.intanon.nectec.or.th>).

   * Slovak and japanese error messages.

   * Configuration and portability fixes.

   * Added option `SET SQL_WARNINGS=1' to get a warning count also for
     simple inserts.

   * MySQL now uses `SIGTERM' instead of `SIGQUIT' with shutdown to
     work better on FreeBSD.

   * Added option `\G' (print vertically) to `mysql'.

   * `SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY ...' killed `mysqld'.

   * `IS NULL' on a `AUTO_INCREMENT' column in a `LEFT JOIN' didn't
     work as expected.

   * New function `MAKE_SET()'.

Changes in release 3.22.10
--------------------------

   * `mysql_install_db' no longer starts the MySQL server!  You should
     start `mysqld' with `safe_mysqld' after installing it!  The MySQL
     RPM will, however, start the server as before.

   * Added `--bootstrap' option to `mysqld' and recoded
     `mysql_install_db' to use it.  This will make it easier to install
     MySQL with RPMs.

   * Changed `+', `-' (sign and minus), `*', `/', `%', `ABS()' and
     `MOD()' to be `BIGINT' aware (64-bit safe).

   * Fixed a bug in `ALTER TABLE' that caused `mysqld' to crash.

   * MySQL now always reports the conflicting key values when a
     duplicate key entry occurs. (Before this was only reported for
     `INSERT').

   * New syntax: `INSERT INTO tbl_name SET col_name=value,
     col_name=value, ...'

   * Most errors in the `.err' log are now prefixed with a time stamp.

   * Added option `MYSQL_INIT_COMMAND' to `mysql_options()' to make a
     query on connect or reconnect.

   * Added option `MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE' and
     `MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP' to `mysql_options()' to read the
     following parameters from the MySQL option files: `port',
     `socket', `compress', `password', `pipe', `timeout', `user',
     `init-command', `host' and `database'.

   * Added `maybe_null' to the UDF structure.

   * Added option `IGNORE' to `INSERT' statements with many rows.

   * Fixed some problems with sorting of the koi8 character sets; Users
     of koi8 *MUST* run `isamchk -rq' on each table that has an index on
     a `CHAR' or `VARCHAR' column.

   * New script `mysql_setpermission', by Luuk de Boer, allows one to
     easily create new users with permissions for specific databases.

   * Allow use of hexadecimal strings (0x...) when specifying a
     constant string (like in the column separators with `LOAD DATA
     INFILE').

   * Ported to OS/2 (thanks to Antony T. Curtis
     <antony.curtis@olcs.net>).

   * Added more variables to `SHOW STATUS' and changed format of output
     to be like `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Added `extended-status' command to `mysqladmin' which will show the
     new status variables.

Changes in release 3.22.9
-------------------------

   * `SET SQL_LOG_UPDATE=0' caused a lockup of the server.

   * New SQL command:  `FLUSH [ TABLES | HOSTS | LOGS | PRIVILEGES ] [,
     ...]'

   * New SQL command:  `KILL' `thread_id'.

   * Added casts and changed include files to make MySQL easier to
     compile on AIX and DEC OSF1 4.x

   * Fixed conversion problem when using `ALTER TABLE' from a `INT' to
     a short `CHAR()' column.

   * Added `SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY'; This will get a lock for the
     `SELECT' even if there is a thread waiting for another `SELECT' to
     get a `WRITE LOCK'.

   * Moved wild_compare to string class to be able to use `LIKE' on
     `BLOB'/`TEXT' columns with `\0'.

   * Added `ESCAPE' option to `LIKE'.

   * Added a lot more output to `mysqladmin debug'.

   * You can now start `mysqld' on Windows with the `--flush' option.
     This will flush all tables to disk after each update.  This makes
     things much safer on NT/Win98 but also *MUCH* slower.

Changes in release 3.22.8
-------------------------

   * Czech character sets should now work much better.  You must also
     install
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/czech-3.22.8-patch'.  This
     patch should also be installed if you are using a character set
     with uses `my_strcoll()'!  The patch should always be safe to
     install (for any system), but as this patch changes ISAM internals
     it's not yet in the default distribution.

   * `DATE_ADD()' and `DATE_SUB()' didn't work with group functions.

   * `mysql' will now also try to reconnect on `USE DATABASE' commands.

   * Fix problem with `ORDER BY' and `LEFT JOIN' and `const' tables.

   * Fixed problem with `ORDER BY' if the first `ORDER BY' column was a
     key and the rest of the `ORDER BY' columns wasn't part of the key.

   * Fixed a big problem with `OPTIMIZE TABLE'.

   * MySQL clients on NT will now by default first try to connect with
     named pipes and after this with TCP/IP.

   * Fixed a problem with `DROP TABLE' and `mysqladmin shutdown' on
     Windows (a fatal bug from 3.22.6).

   * Fixed problems with `TIME columns' and negative strings.

   * Added an extra thread signal loop on shutdown to avoid some error
     messages from the client.

   * MySQL now uses the next available number as extension for the
     update log file.

   * Added patches for UNIXWARE 7.

Changes in release 3.22.7
-------------------------

   * Added `LIMIT' clause for the `DELETE' statement.

   * You can now use the `/*! ... */' syntax to hide MySQL-specific
     keywords when you write portable code.  MySQL will parse the code
     inside the comments as if the surrounding `/*!' and `*/' comment
     characters didn't exist.

   * `OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name' can now be used to reclaim disk space
     after many deletes.  Currently, this uses `ALTER TABLE' to
     regenerate the table, but in the future it will use an integrated
     `isamchk' for more speed.

   * Upgraded `libtool' to get the configure more portable.

   * Fixed slow `UPDATE' and `DELETE' operations when using `DATETIME'
     or `DATE' keys.

   * Changed optimizer to make it better at deciding when to do a full
     join and when using keys.

   * You can now use `mysqladmin proc' to display information about
     your own threads. Only users with the *Process_priv* privilege can
     get information about all threads.

   * Added handling of formats `YYMMDD', `YYYYMMDD', `YYMMDDHHMMSS' for
     numbers when using `DATETIME' and `TIMESTAMP' types. (Formerly
     these formats only worked with strings.)

   * Added connect option `CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE' to allow use of spaces
     after function names and before `(' (Powerbuilder requires this).
     This will make all function names reserved words.

   * Added the `--log-long-format' option to `mysqld' to enable
     timestamps and INSERT_ID's in the update log.

   * Added `--where' option to `mysqldump' (patch by Jim Faucette).

   * The lexical analyzer now uses "perfect hashing" for faster parsing
     of SQL statements.

Changes in release 3.22.6
-------------------------

   * Faster `mysqldump'.

   * For the `LOAD DATA INFILE' statement, you can now use the new
     `LOCAL' keyword to read the file from the client.  `mysqlimport'
     will automatically use `LOCAL' when importing with the TCP/IP
     protocol.

   * Fixed small optimize problem when updating keys.

   * Changed makefiles to support shared libraries.

   * MySQL-NT can now use named pipes, which means that you can now use
     MySQL-NT without having to install TCP/IP.

Changes in release 3.22.5
-------------------------

   * All table lock handing is changed to avoid some very subtle
     deadlocks when using `DROP TABLE', `ALTER TABLE', `DELETE FROM
     TABLE' and `mysqladmin flush-tables' under heavy usage.  Changed
     locking code to get better handling of locks of different types.

   * Updated `DBI' to 1.00 and `DBD' to 1.2.0.

   * Added a check that the error message file contains error messages
     suitable for the current version of `mysqld'. (To avoid errors if
     you accidentally try to use an old error message file.)

   * All count structures in the client (`affected_rows()',
     `insert_id()', ...) are now of type `BIGINT' to allow 64-bit values
     to be used.  This required a minor change in the MySQL protocol
     which should affect only old clients when using tables with
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' values > 16M.

   * The return type of `mysql_fetch_lengths()' has changed from `uint
     *' to `ulong *'. This may give a warning for old clients but
     should work on most machines.

   * Change `mysys' and `dbug' libraries to allocate all thread
     variables in one struct.  This makes it easier to make a threaded
     `libmysql.dll' library.

   * Use the result from `gethostname()' (instead of `uname()') when
     constructing `.pid' file names.

   * New better compressed server/client protocol.

   * `COUNT()', `STD()' and `AVG()' are extended to handle more than 4G
     rows.

   * You can now store values in the range `-838:59:59' <= x <=
     `838:59:59' in a `TIME' column.

   * *WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* If you set a `TIME' column to too
     short a value, MySQL now assumes the value is given as: `[[[D
     ]HH:]MM:]SS' instead of `HH[:MM[:SS]]'.

   * `TIME_TO_SEC()' and `SEC_TO_TIME()' can now handle negative times
     and hours up to 32767.

   * Added new option `SET OPTION SQL_LOG_UPDATE={0|1}' to allow users
     with the *process* privilege to bypass the update log.  (Modified
     patch from Sergey A Mukhin <violet@rosnet.net>.)

   * Fixed fatal bug in `LPAD()'.

   * Initialize line buffer in `mysql.cc' to make `BLOB' reading from
     pipes safer.

   * Added `-O max_connect_errors=#' option to `mysqld'.  Connect
     errors are now reset for each correct connection.

   * Increased the default value of `max_allowed_packet' to `1M' in
     `mysqld'.

   * Added `--low-priority-updates' option to `mysqld', to give
     table-modifying operations (`INSERT', `REPLACE', `UPDATE',
     `DELETE') lower priority than retrievals.  You can now use
     `{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...' You can
     also use `SET OPTION SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES={0|1}' to change the
     priority for one thread.  One side effect is that `LOW_PRIORITY'
     is now a reserved word. :(

   * Add support for `INSERT INTO table ... VALUES(...),(...),(...)',
     to allow inserting multiple rows with a single statement.

   * `INSERT INTO tbl_name' is now also cached when used with `LOCK
     TABLES'.  (Previously only `INSERT ... SELECT' and `LOAD DATA
     INFILE' were cached.)

   * Allow `GROUP BY' functions with `HAVING':
          mysql> SELECT col FROM table GROUP BY col HAVING COUNT(*)>0;

   * `mysqld' will now ignore trailing `;' characters in queries. This
     is to make it easier to migrate from some other SQL servers that
     require the trailing `;'.

   * Fix for corrupted fixed-format output generated by `SELECT INTO
     OUTFILE'.

   * *WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* Added Oracle `GREATEST()' and
     `LEAST()' functions.  You must now use these instead of the
     `MAX()' and `MIN()' functions to get the largest/smallest value
     from a list of values. These can now handle `REAL', `BIGINT' and
     string (`CHAR' or `VARCHAR') values.

   * *WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* `DAYOFWEEK()' had offset 0 for
     Sunday. Changed the offset to 1.

   * Give an error for queries that mix `GROUP BY' columns and fields
     when there is no `GROUP BY' specification.

   * Added `--vertical' option to `mysql', for printing results in
     vertical mode.

   * Index-only optimization; some queries are now resolved using only
     indexes.  Until MySQL 4.0, this works only for numeric columns.
     *Note MySQL indexes: MySQL indexes.

   * Lots of new benchmarks.

   * A new C API chapter and lots of other improvements in the manual.

Changes in release 3.22.4
-------------------------

   * Added `--tmpdir' option to `mysqld', for specifying the location
     of the temporary file directory.

   * MySQL now automatically changes a query from an ODBC client:
          SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL
     to:
          SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column == LAST_INSERT_ID()
     This allows some ODBC programs (Delphi, Access) to retrieve the
     newly inserted row to fetch the `AUTO_INCREMENT' id.

   * `DROP TABLE' now waits for all users to free a table before
     deleting it.

   * Fixed small memory leak in the new connect protocol.

   * New functions `BIN()', `OCT()', `HEX()' and `CONV()' for
     converting between different number bases.

   * Added function `SUBSTRING()' with 2 arguments.

   * If you created a table with a record length smaller than 5, you
     couldn't delete rows from the table.

   * Added optimization to remove const reference tables from `ORDER
     BY' and `GROUP BY'.

   * `mysqld' now automatically disables system locking on Linux and
     Windows, and for systems that use MIT-pthreads.  You can force the
     use of locking with the `--enable-locking' option.

   * Added `--console' option to `mysqld', to force a console window
     (for error messages) when using Windows.

   * Fixed table locks for Windows.

   * Allow `$' in identifiers.

   * Changed name of user-specific configuration file from `my.cnf' to
     `.my.cnf' (Unix only).

   * Added `DATE_ADD()' and `DATE_SUB()' functions.

Changes in release 3.22.3
-------------------------

   * Fixed a lock problem (bug in MySQL Version 3.22.1) when closing
     temporary tables.

   * Added missing `mysql_ping()' to the client library.

   * Added `--compress' option to all MySQL clients.

   * Changed `byte' to `char' in `mysql.h' and `mysql_com.h'.

Changes in release 3.22.2
-------------------------

   * Searching on multiple constant keys that matched more than 30% of
     the rows didn't always use the best possible key.

   * New functions `<<', `>>', `RPAD()' and `LPAD()'.

   * You can now save default options (like passwords) in a
     configuration file (`my.cnf').

   * Lots of small changes to get `ORDER BY' to work when no records
     are found when using fields that are not in `GROUP BY' (MySQL
     extension).

   * Added `--chroot' option to `mysqld', to start `mysqld' in a chroot
     environment (by Nikki Chumakov <nikkic@cityline.ru>).

   * Trailing spaces are now ignored when comparing case-sensitive
     strings; this should fix some problems with ODBC and flag 512!

   * Fixed a core-dump bug in the range optimizer.

   * Added `--one-thread' option to `mysqld', for debugging with
     LinuxThreads (or `glibc').  (This replaces the `-T32' flag)

   * Added `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS' to prevent an error from occurring if
     the table doesn't exist.

   * `IF' and `EXISTS' are now reserved words (they would have to be
     sooner or later).

   * Added lots of new options to `mysqldump'.

   * Server error messages are now in `mysqld_error.h'.

   * The server/client protocol now supports compression.

   * All bug fixes from MySQL Version 3.21.32.

Changes in release 3.22.1
-------------------------

   * Added new C API function `mysql_ping()'.

   * Added new API functions `mysql_init()' and `mysql_options()'.  You
     now MUST call `mysql_init()' before you call
     `mysql_real_connect()'.  You don't have to call `mysql_init()' if
     you only use `mysql_connect()'.

   * Added `mysql_options(...,MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT,...)' so you
     can set a timeout for connecting to a server.

   * Added `--timeout' option to `mysqladmin', as a test of
     `mysql_options()'.

   * Added `AFTER column' and `FIRST' options to `ALTER TABLE ... ADD
     columns'.  This makes it possible to add a new column at some
     specific location within a row in an existing table.

   * `WEEK()' now takes an optional argument to allow handling of weeks
     when the week starts on Monday (some European countries).  By
     default, `WEEK()' assumes the week starts on Sunday.

   * `TIME' columns weren't stored properly (bug in MySQL Version
     3.22.0).

   * `UPDATE' now returns information about how many rows were matched
     and updated, and how many "warnings" occurred when doing the
     update.

   * Fixed incorrect result from `FORMAT(-100,2)'.

   * `ENUM' and `SET' columns were compared in binary (case-sensitive)
     fashion; changed to be case insensitive.


File: mysql.info,  Node: News-3.22.0,  Prev: News-3.22.1,  Up: News-3.22.x

Changes in release 3.22.0
-------------------------

   * New (backward compatible) connect protocol that allows you to
     specify the database to use when connecting, to get much faster
     connections to a specific database.

     The `mysql_real_connect()' call is changed to:

          mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
                             const char *passwd, const char *db, uint port,
                             const char *unix_socket, uint client_flag)

   * Each connection is handled by its own thread, rather than by the
     master `accept()' thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
     that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.

   * All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward resolution of
     the hostname to get better security. `mysqld' now has a local
     hostname resolver cache so connections should actually be faster
     than before, even with this feature.

   * A site automatically will be blocked from future connections if
     someone repeatedly connects with an "improper header" (like when
     one uses telnet).

   * You can now refer to tables in different databases with references
     of the form `tbl_name@db_name' or `db_name.tbl_name'.  This makes
     it possible to give a user read access to some tables and write
     access to others simply by keeping them in different databases!

   * Added `--user' option to `mysqld', to allow it to run as another
     Unix user (if it is started as the Unix `root' user).

   * Added caching of users and access rights (for faster access rights
     checking)

   * Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change their password with
     `mysqladmin password 'new_password''.  This uses encrypted
     passwords that are not logged in the normal MySQL log!

   * All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86
     Linux machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.

   * For tables that have many columns, the column names are now hashed
     for much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some
     benchmark tests a lot!)

   * Some benchmarks are changed to get better individual timing.
     (Some loops were so short that a specific test took < 2 seconds.
     The loops have been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it
     easier to compare different databases. A test that took 1-2
     seconds before now takes 11-24 seconds, which is much better)

   * Re-arranged `SELECT' code to handle some very specific queries
     involving group functions (like `COUNT(*)') without a `GROUP BY'
     but with `HAVING'. The following now works:
          mysql> SELECT count(*) as C FROM table HAVING C > 1;

   * Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid
     some calls to `malloc()'.

   * Added `-T32' option to `mysqld', for running all queries under the
     main thread.  This makes it possible to debug `mysqld' under Linux
     with `gdb'!

   * Added optimization of `not_null_column IS NULL' (needed for some
     Access queries).

   * Allow `STRAIGHT_JOIN' to be used between two tables to force the
     optimizer to join them in a specific order.

   * String functions now return `VARCHAR' rather than `CHAR' and the
     column type is now `VARCHAR' for fields saved as `VARCHAR'.  This
     should make the *MyODBC* driver better, but may break some old
     MySQL clients that don't handle `FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR' the same way
     as `FIELD_TYPE_CHAR'.

   * `CREATE INDEX' and `DROP INDEX' are now implemented through `ALTER
     TABLE'.  `CREATE TABLE' is still the recommended (fast) way to
     create indexes.

   * Added `--set-variable' option `wait_timeout' to `mysqld'.

   * Added time column to `mysqladmin processlist' to show how long a
     query has taken or how long a thread has slept.

   * Added lots of new variables to `show variables' and some new to
     `show status'.

   * Added new type `YEAR'. `YEAR' is stored in 1 byte with allowable
     values of 0, and 1901 to 2155.

   * Added new `DATE' type that is stored in 3 bytes rather than 4
     bytes.  All new tables are created with the new date type if you
     don't use the `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld'.

   * Fixed bug in record caches; for some queries, you could get `Error
     from table handler: #' on some operating systems.

   * Added `--enable-assembler' option to `configure', for x86 machines
     (tested on Linux + `gcc').  This will enable assembler functions
     for the most important string functions for more speed!

Changes in release 3.21.33
--------------------------

   * Fixed problem when sending `SIGHUP' to `mysqld'; `mysqld' core
     dumped when starting from boot on some systems.

   * Fixed problem with losing a little memory for some connections.

   * `DELETE FROM tbl_name' without a `WHERE' condition is now done the
     long way when you use `LOCK TABLES' or if the table is in use, to
     avoid race conditions.

   * `INSERT INTO TABLE (timestamp_column) VALUES (NULL);' didn't set
     timestamp.

Changes in release 3.21.32
--------------------------

   * Fixed some possible race conditions when doing many reopen/close
     on the same tables under heavy load!  This can happen if you
     execute `mysqladmin refresh' often. This could in some very rare
     cases corrupt the header of the index file and cause error 126 or
     138.

   * Fixed fatal bug in `refresh()' when running with the
     `--skip-locking' option.  There was a "very small" time gap after
     a `mysqladmin refresh' when a table could be corrupted if one
     thread updated a table while another thread did `mysqladmin
     refresh' and another thread started a new update ont the same table
     before the first thread had finished.  A refresh (or
     `--flush-tables') will now not return until all used tables are
     closed!

   * `SELECT DISTINCT' with a `WHERE' clause that didn't match any rows
     returned a row in some contexts (bug only in 3.21.31).

   * `GROUP BY' + `ORDER BY' returned one empty row when no rows where
     found.

   * Fixed a bug in the range optimizer that wrote `Use_count: Wrong
     count for ...' in the error log file.

Changes in release 3.21.31
--------------------------

   * Fixed a sign extension problem for the `TINYINT' type on Irix.

   * Fixed problem with `LEFT("constant_string",function)'.

   * Fixed problem with `FIND_IN_SET()'.

   * `LEFT JOIN' core dumped if the second table is used with a constant
     `WHERE/ON' expression that uniquely identifies one record.

   * Fixed problems with `DATE_FORMAT()' and incorrect dates.
     `DATE_FORMAT()' now ignores `'%'' to make it possible to extend it
     more easily in the future.

Changes in release 3.21.30
--------------------------

   * `mysql' now returns an exit code > 0 if the query returned an
     error.

   * Saving of command line history to file in `mysql' client.  By
     Tommy Larsen <tommy@mix.hive.no>.

   * Fixed problem with empty lines that were ignored in `mysql.cc'.

   * Save the pid of the signal handler thread in the pid file instead
     of the pid of the main thread.

   * Added patch by <tommy@valley.ne.jp> to support Japanese characters
     SJIS and UJIS.

   * Changed `safe_mysqld' to redirect startup messages to
     `'hostname'.err' instead of `'hostname'.log' to reclaim file space
     on `mysqladmin refresh'.

   * `ENUM' always had the first entry as default value.

   * `ALTER TABLE' wrote two entries to the update log.

   * `sql_acc()' now closes the `mysql' grant tables after a reload to
     save table space and memory.

   * Changed `LOAD DATA' to use less memory with tables and `BLOB'
     columns.

   * Sorting on a function which made a division / 0 produced a wrong
     set in some cases.

   * Fixed `SELECT' problem with `LEFT()' when using the czech character
     set.

   * Fixed problem in `isamchk'; it couldn't repair a packed table in a
     very unusual case.

   * `SELECT' statements with `&' or `|' (bit functions) failed on
     columns with `NULL' values.

   * When comparing a field = field, where one of the fields was a part
     key, only the length of the part key was compared.

--------------------------

   * `LOCK TABLES' + `DELETE from tbl_name' never removed locks
     properly.

   * Fixed problem when grouping on an `OR' function.

   * Fixed permission problem with `umask()' and creating new databases.

   * Fixed permission problem on result file with `SELECT ... INTO
     OUTFILE ...'

   * Fixed problem in range optimizer (core dump) for a very complex
     query.

   * Fixed problem when using `MIN(integer)' or `MAX(integer)' in
     `GROUP BY'.

   * Fixed bug on Alpha when using integer keys. (Other keys worked on
     Alpha).

--------------------------

   * Added user level lock functions `GET_LOCK(string,timeout)',
     `RELEASE_LOCK(string)'.

   * Added `opened_tables' to `show status'.

   * Changed connect timeout to 3 seconds to make it somewhat harder
     for crackers to kill `mysqld' through telnet + TCP/IP.

   * Fixed bug in range optimizer when using `WHERE key_part_1 >=
     something AND key_part_2 <= something_else'.

   * Changed `configure' for detection of FreeBSD 3.0 9803xx and above

   * `WHERE' with string_column_key = constant_string didn't always find
     all rows if the column had many values differing only with
     characters of the same sort value (like e and e').

   * Strings keys looked up with 'ref' were not compared in
     case-sensitive fashion.

   * Added `umask()' to make log files non-readable for normal users.

   * Ignore users with old (8-byte) password on startup if not using
     `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld'.

   * `SELECT' which matched all key fields returned the values in the
     case of the matched values, not of the found values. (Minor
     problem.)

--------------------------

   * `FROM_DAYS(0)' now returns "0000-00-00".

   * In `DATE_FORMAT()', PM and AM were swapped for hours 00 and 12.

   * Extended the default maximum key size to 256.

   * Fixed bug when using `BLOB'/`TEXT' in `GROUP BY' with many tables.

   * An `ENUM' field that is not declared `NOT NULL' has `NULL' as the
     default value.  (Previously, the default value was the first
     enumeration value.)

   * Fixed bug in the join optimizer code when using many part keys on
     the same key:  `INDEX (Organization,Surname(35),Initials(35))'.

   * Added some tests to the table order optimizer to get some cases
     with `SELECT ... FROM many_tables' much faster.

   * Added a retry loop around `accept()' to possibly fix some problems
     on some Linux machines.

--------------------------

   * Changed `typedef 'string'' to `typedef 'my_string'' for better
     portability.

   * You can now kill threads that are waiting on a disk-full condition.

   * Fixed some problems with UDF functions.

   * Added long options to `isamchk'. Try `isamchk --help'.

   * Fixed a bug when using 8 bytes long (alpha); `filesort()' didn't
     work.  Affects `DISTINCT', `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' on 64-bit
     processors.

--------------------------

   * Dynamic loadable functions. Based on source from Alexis Mikhailov.

   * You couldn't delete from a table if no one had done a `SELECT' on
     the table.

   * Fixed problem with range optimizer with many `OR' operators on key
     parts inside each other.

   * Recoded `MIN()' and `MAX()' to work properly with strings and
     `HAVING'.

   * Changed default umask value for new files from `0664' to `0660'.

   * Fixed problem with `LEFT JOIN' and constant expressions in the `ON'
     part.

   * Added Italian error messages from <brenno@dewinter.com>.

   * `configure' now works better on OSF1 (tested on 4.0D).

   * Added hooks to allow `LIKE' optimization with international
     character support.

   * Upgraded `DBI' to 0.93.

Changes in release 3.21.23
--------------------------

   * The following symbols are now reserved words: `TIME', `DATE',
     `TIMESTAMP', `TEXT', `BIT', `ENUM', `NO', `ACTION', `CHECK',
     `YEAR', `MONTH', `DAY', `HOUR', `MINUTE', `SECOND', `STATUS',
     `VARIABLES'.

   * Setting a `TIMESTAMP' to `NULL' in `LOAD DATA INFILE ...' didn't
     set the current time for the `TIMESTAMP'.

   * Fix `BETWEEN' to recognize binary strings. Now `BETWEEN' is case
     sensitive.

   * Added `--skip-thread-priority' option to `mysqld', for systems
     where `mysqld''s thread scheduling doesn't work properly (BSDI
     3.1).

   * Added ODBC functions `DAYNAME()' and `MONTHNAME()'.

   * Added function `TIME_FORMAT()'.  This works like `DATE_FORMAT()',
     but takes a time string (`'HH:MM:DD'') as argument.

   * Fixed unlikely(?) key optimizer bug when using `OR's of key parts
     inside `AND's.

   * Added command `variables' to `mysqladmin'.

   * A lot of small changes to the binary releases.

   * Fixed a bug in the new protocol from MySQL Version 3.21.20.

   * Changed `ALTER TABLE' to work with Windows (Windows can't rename
     open files).  Also fixed a couple of small bugs in the Windows
     version.

   * All standard MySQL clients are now ported to MySQL-Windows.

   * MySQL can now be started as a service on NT.

     hppa, AIX 4.2.1 ppc, OSF1 V4.0 alpha, FreeBSD 2.2.2 i86pc and BSDI
     3.1 i386.

   * Fix `COUNT(*)' problems when the `WHERE' clause didn't match any
     records.  (Bug from 3.21.17.)

   * Removed that `NULL = NULL' is true.  Now you must use `IS NULL' or
     `IS NOT NULL' to test whether or not a value is `NULL'.  (This is
     according to ANSI SQL but may break old applications that are
     ported from `mSQL'.)  You can get the old behavior by compiling
     with `-DmSQL_COMPLIANT'.

   * Fixed bug that core dumped when using many `LEFT OUTER JOIN'
     clauses.

   * Fixed bug in `ORDER BY' on string formula with possible `NULL'
     values.

   * Fixed problem in range optimizer when using <= on sub index.

   * Added functions `DAYOFYEAR()', `DAYOFMONTH()', `MONTH()',
     `YEAR()', `WEEK()', `QUARTER()', `HOUR()', `MINUTE()', `SECOND()'
     and `FIND_IN_SET()'.

   * Added command `SHOW VARIABLES'.

   * Added support of "long constant strings" from ANSI SQL:
          mysql> SELECT 'first ' 'second';       -> 'first second'

   * Upgraded mSQL-Mysql-modules to 1.1825.

   * Upgraded `mysqlaccess' to 2.02.

   * Fixed problem with Russian character set and `LIKE'.

   * Ported to OpenBSD 2.1.

   * New Dutch error messages.

--------------------------

   * Fixed optimizer bug when using `WHERE data_field = date_field2 AND

--------------------------

   * Changed the maximum table name and column name lengths from 32 to
     64.

   * Aliases can now be of "any" length.

   * Fixed `mysqladmin stat' to return the right number of queries.

   * Changed protocol (downward compatible) to mark if a column has the
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' attribute or is a `TIMESTAMP'. This is needed for
     the new Java driver.

   * Added Hebrew sorting order by Zeev Suraski.

   * Solaris 2.6: Fixed `configure' bugs and increased maximum table
     size from 2G to 4G.

--------------------------

   * Upgraded `DBD' to 1823. This version implements `mysql_use_result'
     in `DBD-Mysql'.

   * Benchmarks updated for empress (by Luuk).

   * Fixed a case of slow range searching.

   * Configure fixes (`Docs' directory).

Changes in release 3.21.18
--------------------------

   * Issue error message if client C functions are called in wrong
     order.

   * Added automatic reconnect to the `libmysql.c' library. If a write
     command fails, an automatic reconnect is done.

   * Small sort sets no longer use temporary files.

   * Upgraded `DBI' to 0.91.

   * Fixed a couple of problems with `LEFT OUTER JOIN'.

   * Added `CROSS JOIN' syntax. `CROSS' is now a reserved word.

   * Recoded `yacc'/`bison' stack allocation to be even safer and to
     allow MySQL to handle even bigger expressions.

   * Fixed a couple of problems with the update log.

   * `ORDER BY' was slow when used with key ranges.

Changes in release 3.21.17
--------------------------

   * Changed documentation string of `--with-unix-socket-path' to avoid
     confusion.

   * Added ODBC and ANSI SQL style `LEFT OUTER JOIN'.

   * The following are new reserved words: `LEFT', `NATURAL', `USING'.

   * The client library now uses the value of the environment variable
     `MYSQL_HOST' as the default host if it's defined.

   * `SELECT col_name, SUM(expr)' now returns `NULL' for `col_name'
     when there are matching rows.

   * Fixed problem with comparing binary strings and `BLOB's with ASCII
     characters over 127.

   * Fixed lock problem: when freeing a read lock on a table with
     multiple read locks, a thread waiting for a write lock would have
     been given the lock.  This shouldn't affect data integrity, but
     could possibly make `mysqld' restart if one thread was reading
     data that another thread modified.

   * `LIMIT offset,count' didn't work in `INSERT ... SELECT'.

   * Optimized key block caching. This will be quicker than the old
     algorithm when using bigger key caches.

--------------------------

   * Added ODBC 2.0 & 3.0 functions `POWER()', `SPACE()', `COT()',
     `DEGREES()', `RADIANS()', `ROUND(2 arg)' and `TRUNCATE()'.

   * *WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* `LOCATE()' parameters were
     swapped according to ODBC standard. Fixed.

   * Added function `TIME_TO_SEC()'.

   * In some cases, default values were not used for `NOT NULL' fields.

   * Timestamp wasn't always updated properly in `UPDATE SET ...'
     statements.

   * Allow empty strings as default values for `BLOB' and `TEXT', to be
     compatible with `mysqldump'.

Changes in release 3.21.15
--------------------------

   * *WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* `mysqlperl' is now from
     Msql-Mysql-modules. This means that `connect()' now takes `host',
     `database', `user', `password' arguments! The old version took
     `host', `database', `password', `user'.

   * Allow `DATE '1997-01-01'', `TIME '12:10:10'' and `TIMESTAMP
     '1997-01-01 12:10:10'' formats required by ANSI SQL.  *WARNING:
     INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!!* This has the unfortunate side-effect that
     you no longer can have columns named `DATE', `TIME' or
     `TIMESTAMP'. :( Old columns can still be accessed through
     `tablename.columnname'!)

   * Changed Makefiles to hopefully work better with BSD systems. Also,
     `manual.dvi' is now included in the distribution to avoid having
     stupid `make' programs trying to rebuild it.

   * `readline' library upgraded to version 2.1.

   * A new sortorder german-1. That is a normal ISO-Latin1 with a
     german sort order.

   * Perl `DBI'/`DBD' is now included in the distribution. `DBI' is now
     the recommended way to connect to MySQL from Perl.

   * New portable benchmark suite with `DBD', with test results from
     `mSQL' 2.0.3, MySQL, PostgreSQL 6.2.1 and Solid server 2.2.

   * `crash-me' is now included with the benchmarks; This is a Perl
     program designed to find as many limits as possible in a SQL
     server. Tested with `mSQL', PostgreSQL, Solid and MySQL.

   * Fixed bug in range-optimizer that crashed MySQL on some queries.

   * Table and column name completion for `mysql' command line tool, by
     Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans.

   * Added new command `REPLACE' that works like `INSERT' but replaces
     conflicting records with the new record. `REPLACE INTO TABLE ...
     SELECT ...' works also.

   * Added new commands `CREATE DATABASE db_name' and `DROP DATABASE
     db_name'.

   * Added `RENAME' option to `ALTER TABLE': `ALTER TABLE name RENAME
     TO new_name'.

   * `make_binary_distribution' now includes `libgcc.a' in
     `libmysqlclient.a'. This should make linking work for people who
     don't have `gcc'.

   * Changed `net_write()' to `my_net_write()' because of a name
     conflict with Sybase.

   * New function `DAYOFWEEK()' compatible with ODBC.

   * Stack checking and `bison' memory overrun checking to make MySQL
     safer with weird queries.

Changes in release 3.21.14a
---------------------------

   * Ported to SCO Openserver 5.0.4  with FSU Pthreads.

   * HP-UX 10.20 should work.

   * Added new function `DATE_FORMAT()'.

   * Added `NOT IN'.

   * Added automatic removal of 'ODBC function conversions': `{fn now()
     }'

   * Handle ODBC 2.50.3 option flags.

   * Fixed comparison of `DATE' and `TIME' values with `NULL'.

   * Changed language name from germany to german to be consistent with
     the other language names.

   * Fixed sorting problem on functions returning a `FLOAT'.
     Previously, the values were converted to `INT's before sorting.

   * Fixed slow sorting when sorting on key field when using
     `key_column=constant'.

   * Sorting on calculated `DOUBLE' values sorted on integer results
     instead.

   * `mysql' no longer needs a database argument.

   * Changed the place where `HAVING' should be. According to ANSI, it
     should be after `GROUP BY' but before `ORDER BY'. MySQL Version
     3.20 incorrectly had it last.

   * Added Sybase command `USE DATABASE' to start using another
     database.

   * Added automatic adjusting of number of connections and table cache
     size if the maximum number of files that can be opened is less
     than needed.  This should fix that `mysqld' doesn't crash even if
     you haven't done a `ulimit -n 256' before starting `mysqld'.

   * Added lots of limit checks to make it safer when running with too
     little memory or when doing weird queries.

--------------------------

   * Added retry of interrupted reads and clearing of `errno'.  This
     makes Linux systems much safer!

   * Fixed locking bug when using many aliases on the same table in the
     same `SELECT'.

   * Fixed bug with `LIKE' on number key.

   * New error message so you can check whether the connection was lost
     while the command was running or whether the connection was down
     from the start.

   * Added `--table' option to `mysql' to print in table format.  Moved
     time and row information after query result.  Added automatic
     reconnect of lost connections.

   * Added `!=' as a synonym for `<>'.

   * Added function `VERSION()' to make easier logs.

   * New multi-user test `tests/fork_test.pl' to put some strain on the
     thread library.

Changes in release 3.21.12
--------------------------

   * Fixed `ftruncate()' call in MIT-pthreads. This made `isamchk'
     destroy the `.ISM' files on (Free)BSD 2.x systems.

   * Fixed broken `__P_' patch in MIT-pthreads.

   * Many memory overrun checks. All string functions now return `NULL'
     if the returned string should be longer than `max_allowed_packet'
     bytes.

   * Changed the name of the `INTERVAL' type to `ENUM', because
     `INTERVAL' is used in ANSI SQL.

   * In some cases, doing a `JOIN' + `GROUP' + `INTO OUTFILE', the
     result wasn't grouped.

   * `LIKE' with `'_'' as last character didn't work. Fixed.

   * Added extended ANSI SQL `TRIM()' function.

   * Added `CURTIME()'.

   * Added `ENCRYPT()' function by Zeev Suraski.

   * Fixed better `FOREIGN KEY' syntax skipping. New reserved words:
     `MATCH', `FULL', `PARTIAL'.

   * `mysqld' now allows IP number and hostname to the `--bind-address'
     option.

   * Added `SET OPTION CHARACTER SET cp1251_koi8' to enable conversions
     of data to/from cp1251_koi8.

   * Lots of changes for Win95 port. In theory, this version should now
     be easily portable to Win95.

   * Changed the `CREATE COLUMN' syntax of `NOT NULL' columns to be
     after the `DEFAULT' value, as specified in the ANSI SQL standard.
     This will make `mysqldump' with `NOT NULL' and default values
     incompatible with MySQL Version 3.20.

   * Added many function name aliases so the functions can be used with
     ODBC or ANSI SQL92 syntax.

   * Fixed syntax of `ALTER TABLE tbl_name ALTER COLUMN col_name SET
     DEFAULT NULL'.

   * Added `CHAR' and `BIT' as synonyms for `CHAR(1)'.

   * Fixed core dump when updating as a user who has only *select*
     privilege.

   * `INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY' didn't work in some cases. An
     `Invalid use of group function' error occurred.

   * When using `LIMIT', `SELECT' now always uses keys instead of record
     scan.  This will give better performance on `SELECT' and a `WHERE'
     that matches many rows.

   * Added Russian error messages.

Changes in release 3.21.11
--------------------------

   * Configure changes.

   * MySQL now works with the new thread library on BSD/OS 3.0.

   * Added new group functions `BIT_OR()' and `BIT_AND()'.

   * Added compatibility functions `CHECK' and `REFERENCES'.  `CHECK'
     is now a reserved word.

   * Added `ALL' option to `GRANT' for better compatibility. (`GRANT'
     is still a dummy function.)

   * Added partly-translated dutch messages.

   * Fixed bug in `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' with `NULL' columns.

   * Added function `last_insert_id()' to retrieve last `AUTO_INCREMENT'
     value.  This is intended for clients to ODBC that can't use the
     `mysql_insert_id()' API function, but can be used by any client.

   * Added `--flush-logs' option to `mysqladmin'.

   * Added command `STATUS' to `mysql'.

   * Fixed problem with `ORDER BY'/`GROUP BY' because of bug in `gcc'.

   * Fixed problem with `INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY'.

Changes in release 3.21.10
--------------------------

   * New `mysqlaccess'.

   * `CREATE' now supports all ODBC types and the `mSQL' `TEXT' type.
     All ODBC 2.5 functions are also supported (added `REPEAT'). This
     provides better portability.

   * Added text types `TINYTEXT', `TEXT', `MEDIUMTEXT' and `LONGTEXT'.
     These are actually `BLOB'types, but all searching is done in
     case-insensitive fashion.

   * All old `BLOB' fields are now `TEXT' fields.  This only changes
     that all searching on strings is done in case-sensitive fashion.
     You must do an `ALTER TABLE' and change the field type to `BLOB'
     if you want to have tests done in case-sensitive fashion.

   * Fixed some `configure' issues.

   * Made the locking code a bit safer. Fixed very unlikely deadlock
     situation.

   * Fixed a couple of bugs in the range optimizer. Now the new range
     benchmark `test-select' works.

Changes in release 3.21.9
-------------------------

   * Added `--enable-unix-socket=pathname' option to `configure'.

   * Fixed a couple of portability problems with include files.

   * Fixed bug in range calculation that could return empty set when
     searching on multiple key with only one entry (very rare).

   * Most things ported to FSU Pthreads, which should allow MySQL to
     run on SCO. *Note SCO::.

Changes in release 3.21.8
-------------------------

   * Works now in Solaris 2.6.

   * Added handling of calculation of `SUM()' functions.  For example,
     you can now use `SUM(column)/COUNT(column)'.

   * Added handling of trigometric functions: `PI()', `ACOS()',
     `ASIN()', `ATAN()', `COS()', `SIN()' and `TAN()'.

   * New languages: norwegian, norwegian-ny and portuguese.

   * Fixed parameter bug in `net_print()' in `procedure.cc'.

   * Fixed a couple of memory leaks.

   * Now allow also the old `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' syntax.

   * Fixed bug with `GROUP BY' and `SELECT' on key with many values.

   * `mysql_fetch_lengths()' sometimes returned incorrect lengths when
     you used `mysql_use_result()'. This affected at least some cases of
     `mysqldump --quick'.

   * Fixed bug in optimization of `WHERE const op field'.

   * Fixed problem when sorting on `NULL' fields.

   * Fixed a couple of 64-bit (Alpha) problems.

   * Added `--pid-file=#' option to `mysqld'.

   * Added date formatting to `FROM_UNIXTIME()', originally by Zeev
     Suraski.

   * Fixed bug in `BETWEEN' in range optimizer (Did only test = of the
     first argument).

   * Added machine-dependent files for MIT-pthreads i386-SCO. There is
     probably more to do to get this to work on SCO 3.5.

-------------------------

   * Changed `Makefile.am' to take advantage of Automake 1.2.

   * Added the beginnings of a benchmark suite.

   * Added more secure password handling.

   * Added new client function `mysql_errno()', to get the error number
     of the error message. This makes error checking in the client much
     easier.  This makes the new server incompatible with the 3.20.x
     server when running without `--old-protocol'.  The client code is
     backward compatible.  More information can be found in the
     `README' file!

   * Fixed some problems when using very long, illegal names.

     `FreeBSD-3.0-libc_r-1.0.diff', which can be found at
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/'.

   * Added new option `-O tmp_table_size=#' to `mysqld'.

   * New function `FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp)' which returns a date
     string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD' format.

   * New function `SEC_TO_TIME(seconds)' which returns a string in
     'HH:MM:SS' format.

   * Should now configure and compile on OSF1 4.0 with the DEC compiler.

   * Configuration and compilation on BSD/OS 3.0 works, but due to some
     bugs in BSD/OS 3.0, `mysqld' doesn't work on it yet.

   * Configuration and compilation on FreeBSD 3.0 works, but I couldn't

Changes in release 3.21.3
-------------------------

   * Added reverse check lookup of hostnames to get better security.

   * Fixed some possible buffer overflows if filenames that are too
     long are used.

   * `mysqld' doesn't accept hostnames that start with digits followed
     by a `'.'', because the hostname may look like an IP number.

   * Added `--skip-networking' option to `mysqld', to only allow socket
     connections.  (This will not work with MIT-pthreads!)

   * Added check of too long table names for alias.

   * Added check if database name is okay.

   * Added check if too long table names.

   * Removed incorrect `free()' that killed the server on `CREATE
     DATABASE' or `DROP DATABASE'.

   * Changed some `mysqld' `-O' options to better names.

   * Added `-O join_cache_size=#' option to `mysqld'.

   * Added `-O max_join_size=#' option to `mysqld', to be able to set a
     limit how big queries (in this case big = slow) one should be able
     to handle without specifying `SET OPTION SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1'.  A #
     = is about 10 examined records. The default is "unlimited".

   * When comparing a `TIME', `DATE', `DATETIME' or `TIMESTAMP' column
     to a constant, the constant is converted to a time value before
     performing the comparison.  This will make it easier to get ODBC
     (particularly Access97) to work with the above types. It should
     also make dates easier to use and the comparisons should be
     quicker than before.

   * Applied patch from Jochen Wiedmann that allows `query()' in
     `mysqlperl' to take a query with `\0' in it.

   * Storing a timestamp with a 2-digit year (`YYMMDD') didn't work.

   * Fix that timestamp wasn't automatically updated if set in an
     `UPDATE' clause.

   * Now the automatic timestamp field is the FIRST timestamp field.

   * `SELECT * INTO OUTFILE', which didn't correctly if the outfile
     already existed.

   * `mysql' now shows the thread ID when starting or doing a reconnect.

   * Changed the default sort buffer size from 2M to 1M.

Changes in release 3.21.2
-------------------------

   * The range optimizer is coded, but only 85% tested. It can be
     enabled with `--new', but it crashes core a lot yet...

   * More portable. Should compile on AIX and alpha-digital.  At least
     the `isam' library should be relatively 64-bit clean.

   * New `isamchk' which can detect and fix more problems.

   * New options for `isamlog'.

   * Using new version of Automake.

   * Many small portability changes (from the AIX and alpha-digital
     port) Better checking of pthread(s) library.

   * czech error messages by <snajdr@pvt.net>.

   * Decreased size of some buffers to get fewer problems on systems
     with little memory.  Also added more checks to handle "out of
     memory" problems.

   * `mysqladmin': you can now do `mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8' to kill
     multiple threads.

   * When the maximum connection limit is reached, one extra connection
     by a user with the *PROCESS_ACL* privilege is granted.

   * Added `-O backlog=#' option to `mysqld'.

   * Increased maximum packet size from 512K to 1024K for client.

   * Almost all of the function code is now tested in the internal test
     suite.

   * `ALTER TABLE' now returns warnings from field conversions.

   * Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).

   * Added a fix for Visual FoxBase so that any schema name from a table
     specification is automatically removed.

   * New function `ASCII()'.

   * Removed function `BETWEEN(a,b,c)'. Use the standard ANSI syntax
     instead: `expr BETWEEN expr AND expr'.

   * MySQL no longer has to use an extra temporary table when sorting
     on functions or `SUM()' functions.

   * Fixed bug that you couldn't use `tbl_name.field_name' in `UPDATE'.

   * Fixed `SELECT DISTINCT' when using 'hidden group'. For example:
          mysql> SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test
                     GROUP BY some_field;
     Note: `some_field' is normally in the `SELECT' part. ANSI SQL
     should require it.

Changes in release 3.21.0
-------------------------

   * New reserved words used: `INTERVAL', `EXPLAIN', `READ', `WRITE',
     `BINARY'.

   * Added ODBC function `CHAR(num,...)'.

   * New operator `IN'. This uses a binary search to find a match.

   * New command `LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ|WRITE} ...'

   * Added `--log-update' option to `mysqld', to get a log suitable for
     incremental updates.

   * New command `EXPLAIN SELECT ...' to get information about how the
     optimizer will do the join.

   * For easier client code, the client should no longer use
     `FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB', `FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB',
     `FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB' or `FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING' (as previously
     returned by `mysql_list_fields').  You should instead only use
     `FIELD_TYPE_BLOB' or `FIELD_TYPE_STRING'.  If you want exact
     types, you should use the command `SHOW FIELDS'.

   * Added varbinary syntax: `0x######' which can be used as a string
     (default) or a number.

   * `FIELD_TYPE_CHAR' is renamed to `FIELD_TYPE_TINY'.

   * Changed all fields to C++ classes.

   * Removed FORM struct.

   * Fields with `DEFAULT' values no longer need to be `NOT NULL'.

   * New field types:
    `ENUM'
          A string which can take only a couple of defined values. The
          value is stored as a 1-3 byte number that is mapped
          automatically to a string.  This is sorted according to
          string positions!

    `SET'
          A string which may have one or many string values separated
          with ','.  The string is stored as a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-byte
          number where each bit stands for a specific set member.  This
          is sorted according to the unsigned value of the stored
          packed number.

   * Now all function calculation is done with `double' or `long long'.
     This will provide the full 64-bit range with bit functions and fix
     some conversions that previously could result in precision losses.
     One should avoid using `unsigned long long' columns with full
     64-bit range (numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because
     calculations are done with `signed long long'.

   * `ORDER BY' will now put `NULL' field values first. `GROUP BY' will
     also work with `NULL' values.

   * Full `WHERE' with expressions.

   * New range optimizer that can resolve ranges when some keypart
     prefix is constant. Example:
          mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name
                     WHERE key_part_1="customer"
                     AND key_part_2>=10 AND key_part_2<=10;

Changes in release 3.20.x
=========================

Version 3.20 is quite old now, and should be avoided if possible.  This
information is kept here for historical purposes only.

Changes from 3.20.18 to 3.20.32b are not documented here because the
3.21 release branched here. And the relevant changes are also
documented as changes to the 3.21 version.

Changes in release 3.20.18
--------------------------

   * Added `-p#' (remove `#' directories from path) to `isamlog'.  All
     files are written with a relative path from the database directory
     Now `mysqld' shouldn't crash on shutdown when using the
     `--log-isam' option.

   * New `mysqlperl' version. It is now compatible with `msqlperl-0.63'.

   * New `DBD' module available at
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/' site.

   * Added group function `STD()' (standard deviation).

   * The `mysqld' server is now compiled by default without debugging
     information.  This will make the daemon smaller and faster.

   * Now one usually only has to specify the `--basedir' option to
     `mysqld'. All other paths are relative in a normal installation.

   * `BLOB' columns sometimes contained garbage when used with a
     `SELECT' on more than one table and `ORDER BY'.

   * Fixed that calculations that are not in `GROUP BY' work as expected
     (ANSI SQL extension).  Example:
          mysql> SELECT id,id+1 FROM table GROUP BY id;

   * The test of using `MYSQL_PWD' was reversed. Now `MYSQL_PWD' is
     enabled as default in the default release.

   * Fixed conversion bug which caused `mysqld' to core dump with
     Arithmetic error on Sparc-386.

   * Added `--unbuffered' option to `mysql', for new `mysqlaccess'.

   * When using overlapping (unnecessary) keys and join over many
     tables, the optimizer could get confused and return 0 records.

Changes in release 3.20.17
--------------------------

   * You can now use `BLOB' columns and the functions `IS NULL' and `IS
     NOT NULL' in the `WHERE' clause.

   * All communication packets and row buffers are now allocated
     dynamically on demand. The default value of `max_allowed_packet'
     is now 64K for the server and 512K for the client. This is mainly
     used to catch incorrect packets that could trash all memory. The
     server limit may be changed when it is started.

   * Changed stack usage to use less memory.

   * Changed `safe_mysqld' to check for running daemon.

   * The `ELT()' function is renamed to `FIELD()'.  The new `ELT()'
     function returns a value based on an index: `FIELD()' is the
     inverse of `ELT()' Example: `ELT(2,"A","B","C")' returns `"B"'.
     `FIELD("B","A","B","C")' returns `2'.

   * `COUNT(field)', where `field' could have a `NULL' value, now works.

   * A couple of bugs fixed in `SELECT ... GROUP BY'.

   * Fixed memory overrun bug in `WHERE' with many unoptimizable brace
     levels.

   * Fixed some small bugs in the grant code.

   * If hostname isn't found by `get_hostname', only the IP is checked.
     Previously, you got `Access denied'.

   * Inserts of timestamps with values didn't always work.

   * `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... WHERE' could give the error
     `Duplicated field'.

   * Added some tests to `safe_mysqld' to make it "safer".

   * `LIKE' was case sensitive in some places and case insensitive in
     others.  Now `LIKE' is always case insensitive.

   * `mysql.cc': Allow `'#'' anywhere on the line.

   * New command `SET OPTION SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=#'. See the FAQ for more
     details.

   * New version of the `mysqlaccess' script.

   * Change `FROM_DAYS()' and `WEEKDAY()' to also take a full
     `TIMESTAMP' or `DATETIME' as argument. Before they only took a
     number of type `YYYYMMDD' or `YYMMDD'.

   * Added new function `UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp_column)'.

Changes in release 3.20.16
--------------------------

   * More changes in MIT-pthreads to get them safer. Fixed also some
     link bugs at least in SunOS.

   * Changed `mysqld' to work around a bug in MIT-pthreads. This makes
     multiple small `SELECT' operations 20 times faster. Now
     `lock_test.pl' should work.

   * Added `mysql_FetchHash(handle)' to `mysqlperl'.

   * The `mysqlbug' script is now distributed built to allow for
     reporting bugs that appear during the build with it.

   * Changed `libmysql.c' to prefer `getpwuid()' instead of `cuserid()'.

   * Fixed bug in `SELECT' optimizer when using many tables with the
     same column used as key to different tables.

   * Added new latin2 and Russian KOI8 character tables.

   * Added support for a dummy `GRANT' command to satisfy Powerbuilder.

Changes in release 3.20.15
--------------------------

   * Fixed fatal bug `packets out of order' when using MIT-pthreads.

   * Removed possible loop when a thread waits for command from client
     and `fcntl()' fails. Thanks to Mike Bretz for finding this bug.

   * Changed alarm loop in `mysqld.cc' because shutdown didn't always
     succeed in Linux.

   * Removed use of `termbits' from `mysql.cc'.  This conflicted with
     `glibc' 2.0.

   * Fixed some syntax errors for at least BSD and Linux.

   * Fixed bug when doing a `SELECT' as superuser without a database.

   * Fixed bug when doing `SELECT' with group calculation to outfile.

Changes in release 3.20.14
--------------------------

   * If one gives `-p' or `--password' option to `mysql' without an
     argument, the user is solicited for the password from the tty.

   * Added default password from `MYSQL_PWD' (by Elmar Haneke).

   * Added command `kill' to `mysqladmin' to kill a specific MySQL
     thread.

   * Sometimes when doing a reconnect on a down connection this
     succeeded first on second try.

   * Fixed adding an `AUTO_INCREMENT' key with `ALTER_TABLE'.

   * `AVG()' gave too small value on some `SELECT's with `GROUP BY' and
     `ORDER BY'.

   * Added new `DATETIME' type (by Giovanni Maruzzelli
     <maruzz@matrice.it>).

   * Fixed that define `DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS' works.

   * Changed to use a thread to handle alarms instead of signals on
     Solaris to avoid race conditions.

   * Fixed default length of signed numbers. (George Harvey
     <georgeh@pinacl.co.uk>.)

   * Allow anything for `CREATE INDEX'.

   * Add prezeros when packing numbers to `DATE', `TIME' and
     `TIMESTAMP'.

   * Fixed a bug in `OR' of multiple tables (gave empty set).

   * Added many patches to MIT-pthreads. This fixes at least one lookup
     bug.

Changes in release 3.20.13
--------------------------

   * Added ANSI SQL94 `DATE' and `TIME' types.

   * Fixed bug in `SELECT' with `AND'-`OR' levels.

   * Added support for Slovenian characters. The `Contrib' directory
     contains source and instructions for adding other character sets.

   * Fixed bug with `LIMIT' and `ORDER BY'.

   * Allow `ORDER BY' and `GROUP BY' on items that aren't in the
     `SELECT' list.  (Thanks to Wim Bonis <bonis@kiss.de>, for pointing
     this out.)

   * Allow setting of timestamp values in `INSERT'.

   * Fixed bug with `SELECT ... WHERE ... = NULL'.

   * Added changes for `glibc' 2.0. To get `glibc' to work, you should
     add the `gibc-2.0-sigwait-patch' before compiling `glibc'.

   * Fixed bug in `ALTER TABLE' when changing a `NOT NULL' field to
     allow `NULL' values.

   * Added some ANSI92 synonyms as field types to `CREATE TABLE'.
     `CREATE TABLE' now allows `FLOAT(4)' and `FLOAT(8)' to mean
     `FLOAT' and `DOUBLE'.

   * New utility program `mysqlaccess' by <Yves.Carlier@rug.ac.be>.
     This program shows the access rights for a specific user and the
     grant rows that determine this grant.

   * Added `WHERE const op field' (by <bonis@kiss.de>).

Changes in release 3.20.11
--------------------------

   * When using `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE', all temporary tables are ISAM
     instead of HEAP to allow big dumps.

   * Changed date functions to be string functions. This fixed some
     "funny" side effects when sorting on dates.

   * Extended `ALTER TABLE' according to SQL92.

   * Some minor compatibility changes.

   * Added `--port' and `--socket' options to all utility programs and
     `mysqld'.

   * Fixed MIT-pthreads `readdir_r()'. Now `mysqladmin create database'
     and `mysqladmin drop database' should work.

   * Changed MIT-pthreads to use our `tempnam()'. This should fix the
     "sort aborted" bug.

   * Added sync of records count in `sql_update'. This fixed slow
     updates on first connection. (Thanks to Vaclav Bittner for the
     test.)

Changes in release 3.20.10
--------------------------

   * New insert type: `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...'

   * `MEDIUMBLOB' fixed.

   * Fixed bug in `ALTER TABLE' and `BLOB's.

   * `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' now creates the file in the current
     database directory.

   * `DROP TABLE' now can take a list of tables.

   * Oracle synonym `DESCRIBE' (`DESC').

   * Changes to `make_binary_distribution'.

   * Added some comments to installation instructions about
     `configure''s C++ link test.

   * Added `--without-perl' option to `configure'.

   * Lots of small portability changes.

Changes in release 3.20.9
-------------------------

   * `ALTER TABLE' didn't copy null bit. As a result, fields that were
     allowed to have `NULL' values were always `NULL'.

   * `CREATE' didn't take numbers as `DEFAULT'.

   * Some compatibility changes for SunOS.

   * Removed `config.cache' from old distribution.

Changes in release 3.20.7
-------------------------

   * New commands: `ALTER TABLE', `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE' and `LOAD
     DATA INFILE'.

   * New function: `NOW()'.

   * Added new field *file_priv* to `mysql/user' table.

   * New script `add_file_priv' which adds the new field *file_priv* to
     the `user' table. This script must be executed if you want to use
     the new `SELECT ... INTO' and `LOAD DATA INFILE ...' commands with
     a version of MySQL earlier than 3.20.7.

   * Fixed bug in locking code, which made `lock_test.pl' test fail.

   * New files `NEW' and `BUGS'.

   * Changed `select_test.c' and `insert_test.c' to include `config.h'.

   * Added command `status' to `mysqladmin' for short logging.

   * Increased maximum number of keys to 16 and maximum number of key
     parts to 15.

   * Use of sub keys. A key may now be a prefix of a string field.

   * Added `-k' option to `mysqlshow', to get key information for a
     table.

   * Added long options to `mysqldump'.

Changes in release 3.20.6
-------------------------

   * Portable to more systems because of MIT-pthreads, which will be
     used automatically if `configure' cannot find a `-lpthreads'
     library.

   * Added GNU-style long options to almost all programs. Test with
     `program --help'.

   * Some shared library support for Linux.

   * The FAQ is now in `.texi' format and is available in `.html',
     `.txt' and `.ps' formats.

   * Added new SQL function `RAND([init])'.

   * Changed `sql_lex' to handle `\0' unquoted, but the client can't
     send the query through the C API, because it takes a str pointer.
     You must use `mysql_real_query()' to send the query.

   * Added API function `mysql_get_client_info()'.

   * `mysqld' now uses the `N_MAX_KEY_LENGTH' from `nisam.h' as the
     maximum allowed key length.

   * The following now works:
          mysql> SELECT filter_nr,filter_nr FROM filter ORDER BY filter_nr;
     Previously, this resulted in the error: `Column: 'filter_nr' in
     order clause is ambiguous'.

   * `mysql' now outputs `'\0'', `'\t'', `'\n'' and `'\\'' when
     encountering ASCII 0, tab, newline or `'\'' while writing
     tab-separated output.  This is to allow printing of binary data in
     a portable format.  To get the old behavior, use `-r' (or `--raw').

   * Added german error messages (60 of 80 error messages translated).

   * Added new API function `mysql_fetch_lengths(MYSQL_RES *)', which
     returns an array of column lengths (of type `uint').

   * Fixed bug with `IS NULL' in `WHERE' clause.

   * Changed the optimizer a little to get better results when
     searching on a key part.

   * Added `SELECT' option `STRAIGHT_JOIN' to tell the optimizer that
     it should join tables in the given order.

   * Added support for comments starting with `'--'' in `mysql.cc'
     (Postgres syntax).

   * You can have `SELECT' expressions and table columns in a `SELECT'
     which are not used in the group part. This makes it efficient to
     implement lookups.  The column that is used should be a constant
     for each group because the value is calculated only once for the
     first row that is found for a group.
          mysql> SELECT id,lookup.text,sum(*) FROM test,lookup
                   WHERE test.id=lookup.id GROUP BY id;

   * Fixed bug in `SUM(function)' (could cause a core dump).

   * Changed `AUTO_INCREMENT' placement in the SQL query:
          INSERT into table (auto_field) values (0);
     inserted 0, but it should insert an `AUTO_INCREMENT' value.

   * `mysqlshow.c': Added number of records in table. Had to change the
     client code a little to fix this.

   * `mysql' now allows doubled `''' or `""' within strings for
     embedded `'' or `"'.

   * New math functions: `EXP()', `LOG()', `SQRT()', `ROUND()',
     `CEILING()'.

Changes in release 3.20.3
-------------------------

   * The `configure' source now compiles a thread-free client library
     `-lmysqlclient'. This is the only library that needs to be linked
     with client applications.  When using the binary releases, you must
     link with `-lmysql -lmysys -ldbug -lstrings' as before.

   * New `readline' library from `bash-2.0'.

   * LOTS of small changes to `configure' and makefiles (and related
     source).

   * It should now be possible to compile in another directory using
     `VPATH'. Tested with GNU Make 3.75.

   * `safe_mysqld' and `mysql.server' changed to be more compatible
     between the source and the binary releases.

   * `LIMIT' now takes one or two numeric arguments.  If one argument
     is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows in a result. If
     two arguments are given, the first argument indicates the offset
     of the first row to return, the second is the maximum number of
     rows.  With this it's easy to do a poor man's next page/previous
     page WWW application.

   * Changed name of SQL function `FIELDS()' to `ELT()'.  Changed SQL
     function `INTERVALL()' to `INTERVAL()'.

   * Made `SHOW COLUMNS' a synonym for `SHOW FIELDS'.  Added
     compatibility syntax `FRIEND KEY' to `CREATE TABLE'. In MySQL,
     this creates a non-unique key on the given columns.

   * Added `CREATE INDEX' and `DROP INDEX' as compatibility functions.
     In MySQL, `CREATE INDEX' only checks if the index exists and
     issues an error if it doesn't exist. `DROP INDEX' always succeeds.

   * `mysqladmin.c': added client version to version information.

   * Fixed core dump bug in `sql_acl' (core on new connection).

   * Removed `host', `user' and `db' tables from database `test' in the
     distribution.

   * `FIELD_TYPE_CHAR' can now be signed (-128 - 127) or unsigned (0 -
     255) Previously, it was always unsigned.

   * Bug fixes in `CONCAT()' and `WEEKDAY()'.

   * Changed a lot of source to get `mysqld' to be compiled with SunPro
     compiler.

   * SQL functions must now have a `'('' immediately after the function
     name (no intervening space).  For example, `'user('' is regarded
     as beginning a function call, and `'user ('' is regarded as an
     identifier `user' followed by a `'('', not as a function call.

Changes in release 3.20.0
-------------------------

   * The source distribution is done with `configure' and Automake.  It
     will make porting much easier.  The `readline' library is included
     in the distribution.

   * Separate client compilation: the client code should be very easy
     to compile on systems which don't have threads.

   * The old Perl interface code is automatically compiled and
     installed.  Automatic compiling of `DBD' will follow when the new
     `DBD' code is ported.

   * Dynamic language support: `mysqld' can now be started with Swedish
     or English (default) error messages.

   * New functions: `INSERT()', `RTRIM()', `LTRIM()' and `FORMAT()'.

   * `mysqldump' now works correctly for all field types (even
     `AUTO_INCREMENT'). The format for `SHOW FIELDS FROM tbl_name' is
     changed so the `Type' column contains information suitable for
     `CREATE TABLE'.  In previous releases, some `CREATE TABLE'
     information had to be patched when re-creating tables.

   * Some parser bugs from 3.19.5 (`BLOB' and `TIMESTAMP') are
     corrected.  `TIMESTAMP' now returns different date information
     depending on its create length.

   * Changed parser to allow a database, table or field name to start
     with a number or `'_''.

   * All old C code from Unireg changed to C++ and cleaned up. This
     makes the daemon a little smaller and easier to understand.

   * A lot of small bug fixes done.

   * New `INSTALL' files (not final version) and some information
     regarding porting.

Comments on porting to other systems
************************************

A working Posix thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions are not good enough) and on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, <Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr>.

The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
`mit-pthreads/README' and Programming POSIX Threads
(http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/).

The MySQL distribution includes a patched version of Provenzano's
Pthreads from MIT (see MIT Pthreads web page
(http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html)). This can be
used for some operating systems that do not have POSIX threads.

It is also possible to use another user level thread package named FSU
Pthreads (see FSU Pthreads home page
(http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~mueller/pthreads.html)). This
implementation is being used for the SCO port.

See the `thr_lock.c' and `thr_alarm.c' programs in the `mysys'
directory for some tests/examples of these problems.

Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler (we use `gcc'
and have tried SparcWorks). Another compiler that is known to work is
the Irix `cc'.

To compile only the client use `./configure --without-server'.

There is currently no support for only compiling the server, nor is it
likly to be added unless someone has a good reason for it.

If you want/need to change any `Makefile' or the configure script you
must get Automake and Autoconf. We have used the `automake-1.2' and
`autoconf-2.12' distributions.

All steps needed to remake everything from the most basic files.

     /bin/rm */.deps/*.P
     /bin/rm -f config.cache
     aclocal
     autoheader
     aclocal
     automake
     autoconf
     ./configure --with-debug=full --prefix='your installation directory'
     
     # The makefiles generated above need GNU make 3.75 or newer.
     # (called gmake below)
     gmake clean all install init-db

If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some
debugging of MySQL!  *Note Debugging server::.

*NOTE:* Before you start debugging `mysqld', first get the test
programs `mysys/thr_alarm' and `mysys/thr_lock' to work.  This will
ensure that your thread installation has even a remote chance to work!

Debugging a MySQL server
========================

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL, you can
try to run `mysqld' with the `--skip-new' (which will disable all new,
potentially unsafe functionality) or with `--safe-mode' which disables
a lot of optimization that may cause problems.  *Note Crashing::.

If `mysqld' doesn't want to start, you should check that you don't have
any `my.cnf' files that interfere with your setup!  You can check your
`my.cnf' arguments with `mysqld --print-defaults' and avoid using them
by starting with `mysqld --no-defaults ...'.

If `mysqld' starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it "hangs", you can
use `mysqladmin processlist status' to find out if someone is executing
a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to run
`mysqladmin -i10 processlist status' in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't
connect.

The command `mysqladmin debug' will dump some information about locks
in use, used memory and query usage to the mysql log file. This may
help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimize the table with `OPTIMIZE TABLE' or `myisamchk'.
*Note MySQL Database Administration::. You should also check the slow
queries with `EXPLAIN'.

You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.  *Note Operating
System Specific Notes::.

Compiling MYSQL for debugging.
------------------------------

If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the `--with-debug' or
the `--with-debug=full' option.  You can check whether or not MySQL was
compiled with debugging by doing: `mysqld --help'.  If the `--debug'
flag is listed with the options then you have debugging enabled.
`mysqladmin ver' also lists the `mysqld' version as `mysql ... --debug'
in this case.

If you are using gcc or egcs, the recommended configure line is:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex

This will avoid problems with the `libstdc++' library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL with
`--with-debug=full', which will install a memory allocation
(`SAFEMALLOC') checker. Running with `SAFEMALLOC' is however quite
slow, so if you get performance problems you should start `mysqld' with
the `--skip-safemalloc' option. This will disable the memory overrun
checks for each call to `malloc' and `free'.

If `mysqld' stops crashing when you compile it with `--with-debug', you
have probably found a compiler bug or a timing bug within MySQL.  In
this case you can try to add `-g' to the `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS'
variables above and not use `--with-debug'. If `mysqld' now dies, you
can at least attach to it with `gdb' or use `gdb' on the core file to
find out what happened.

When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a lot
of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of `mysqld'.
If they find something "unexpected," an entry will be written to
`stderr', which `safe_mysqld' directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing, of course, is to
send mail to <mysql@lists.mysql.com> and ask for help.  Please use the
`mysqlbug' script for all bug reports or questions regarding the MySQL
version you are using!

In the Windows MySQL distribution, `mysqld.exe' is by default compiled
with support for trace files.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Making trace files,  Next: Using gdb on mysqld,  Prev: Compiling for debugging,  Up: Debugging server

Creating trace files
--------------------

If the `mysqld' server doesn't start or if you can cause the `mysqld'
server to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace file to find the
problem.

To do this you have to have a `mysqld' that is compiled for debugging.
You can check this by executing `mysqld -V'.  If the version number
ends with `-debug', it's compiled with support for trace files.

Start the `mysqld' server with a trace log in `/tmp/mysqld.trace' (or
`C:\mysqld.trace' on Windows):

`mysqld --debug'

On Windows you should also use the `--standalone' flag to not start
`mysqld' as a service:

In a DOS window do:

     mysqld --debug --standalone

After this you can use the `mysql.exe' command line tool in a second
DOS window to reproduce the problem. You can take down the above
`mysqld' server with `mysqladmin shutdown'.

Note that the trace file will get very _BIG_!  If you want to have a
smaller trace file, you can use something like:

`mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace'

which only prints information with the most interesting tags in
`/tmp/mysqld.trace'.

If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
`ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret' so that a MySQL developer
can take a look a this.

The trace file is made with the *DBUG* package by Fred Fish.  *Note The
DBUG package::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Using gdb on mysqld,  Next: Using stack trace,  Prev: Making trace files,  Up: Debugging server

Debugging mysqld under gdb
--------------------------

On most system you can also start `mysqld' from `gdb' to get more
information if `mysqld' crashes.

With some older `gdb' versions on Linux you must use `run --one-thread'
if you want to be able to debug `mysqld' threads.  In this case you can
only have one thread active at a time.

When running `mysqld' under gdb, you should disable the stack trace
with `--skip-stack-trace' to be able to catch segfaults within gdb.

It's very hard to debug MySQL under `gdb' if you do a lot of new
connections the whole time as `gdb' doesn't free the memory for old
threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting `mysqld' with `-O
thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1''.  In most cases just using `-O
thread_cache_size=5'' will help a lot!

If you want to get a core dump on Linux if `mysqld' dies with a SIGSEGV
signal, you can start `mysqld' with the `--core-file' option.  This
core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you find out
why `mysqld' died:

     shell> gdb mysqld core
     gdb>   backtrace full
     gdb>   exit

*Note Crashing::.

If you are using gdb 4.17.x or above on Linux, you should install a
`.gdb' file, with the following information, in your current directory:

     set print sevenbit off
     handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
     handle SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
     handle SIGWAITING nostop noprint
     handle SIGLWP nostop noprint
     handle SIGPIPE nostop
     handle SIGALRM nostop
     handle SIGHUP nostop
     handle SIGTERM nostop noprint

If you have problems debugging threads with gdb, you should download
gdb 5.x and try this instead. The new gdb version has very improved
thread handling!

Here is an example how to debug mysqld:

     shell> gdb /usr/local/libexec/mysqld
     gdb> run
     ...
     backtrace full # Do this when mysqld crashes

Include the above output in a mail generated with `mysqlbug' and mail
this to `mysql@lists.mysql.com'.

If `mysqld' hangs you can try to use some system tools like `strace' or
`/usr/proc/bin/pstack' to examine where `mysqld' has hung.

     strace /tmp/log libexec/mysqld

If you are using the Perl `DBI' interface, you can turn on debugging
information by using the `trace' method or by setting the `DBI_TRACE'
environment variable.  *Note Perl `DBI' Class: Perl DBI Class.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Using stack trace,  Next: Using log files,  Prev: Using gdb on mysqld,  Up: Debugging server

Using a stack trace
-------------------

On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace if
`mysqld' dies unexpectedly. You can use this to find out where (and
maybe why) `mysqld' died. *Note Error log::.  To get a stack trace, you
should NOT compile `mysqld' with the `-fomit-frame-pointer' option to
gcc. *Note Compiling for debugging::.

If the error file contains something like the following:

     mysqld got signal 11;
     The manual section 'Debugging a MySQL server' tells you how to use a
     stack trace and/or the core file to produce a readable backtrace that may
     help in finding out why mysqld died
     Attemping backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
     where mysqld died.  If you see no messages after this, something went
     terribly wrong
     stack range sanity check, ok, backtrace follows
     0x40077552
     0x81281a0
     0x8128f47
     0x8127be0
     0x8127995
     0x8104947
     0x80ff28f
     0x810131b
     0x80ee4bc
     0x80c3c91
     0x80c6b43
     0x80c1fd9
     0x80c1686

you can find where `mysqld' died by doing the following:

  1. Copy the above numbers to a file, for example `mysqld.stack'.

  2. Make a symbol file for the `mysqld' server:
          nm -n libexec/mysqld > /tmp/mysqld.sym

     Note that many MySQL binary distributions comes with the above
     file, named `mysqld.sym.gz'.  In this case you must unpack this by
     doing:
          gunzip < bin/mysqld.sym.gz > /tmp/mysqld.sym

  3. Execute `resolve_stack_dump -s /tmp/mysqld.sym -n mysqld.stack'.

     This will print out where `mysqld' died. If this doesn't help you
     find out why `mysqld' died, you should make a bug report and
     include the output from the above commend with the bug report.

     Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a
     stack trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to
     locate the bug or provide a workaround, we would in most cases
     need to know the query that killed `mysqld' and preferable a test
     case so that we can repeat the problem!  *Note Bug reports::.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Using log files,  Next: Reproduceable test case,  Prev: Using stack trace,  Up: Debugging server

Using log files to find cause of errors in mysqld
-------------------------------------------------

Note that before starting `mysqld' with `--log' you should check all
your tables with `myisamchk'.  *Note MySQL Database Administration::.

If `mysqld' dies or hangs, you should start `mysqld' with `--log'.
When `mysqld' dies again, you can examine the end of the log file for
the query that killed `mysqld'.

If you are using `--log' without a file name, the log is stored in the
database directory as 'hostname'.log In most cases it's the last query
in the log file that killed `mysqld', but if possible you should verify
this by restarting `mysqld' and executing the found query from the
`mysql' command line tools. If this works, you should also test all
complicated queries that didn't complete.

You can also try the command `EXPLAIN' on all `SELECT' statements that
takes a long time to ensure that `mysqld' is using indexes properly.
*Note `EXPLAIN': EXPLAIN.

You can find the queries that take a long time to execute by starting
`mysqld' with `--log-slow-queries'. *Note Slow query log::.

If you find the text `mysqld restarted' in the error log file (normally
named `hostname.err') you have probably found a query that causes
`mysqld' to fail.  If this happens you should check all your tables
with `myisamchk' (*note MySQL Database Administration::), and test the
queries in the MySQL log files to see if one doesn't work.  If you find
such a query, try first upgrading to the newest MySQL version.  If this
doesn't help and you can't find anything in the `mysql' mail archive,
you should report the bug to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.  Links to mail
archives are available online at the MySQL documentation page
(http://www.mysql.com/documentation/).

If you have started `mysqld' with `--with-myisam-recover', MySQL will
automatically check and try to repair `MyISAM' tables if they are
marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If this happens, MySQL
will write an entry in the `hostname.err' file `'Warning: Checking
table ...'' which is followed by `Warning: Repairing table' if the
table needs to be repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without
`mysqld' having died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong
and needs to be investigated further. *Note Command-line options::.

It's of course not a good sign if `mysqld' did died unexpectedly, but
in this case one shouldn't investigate the `Checking table...' messages
but instead try to find out why `mysqld' died.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Reproduceable test case,  Prev: Using log files,  Up: Debugging server

Making a test case when you experience table corruption
-------------------------------------------------------

If you get corrupted tables or if `mysqld' always fails after some
update commands, you can test if this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

   * Take down the MySQL daemon (with `mysqladmin shutdown').

   * Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely
     case that the repair will do something bad).

   * Check all tables with `myisamchk -s database/*.MYI'.  Repair any
     wrong tables with `myisamchk -r database/table.MYI'.

   * Make a second backup of the tables.

   * Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
     directory if you need more space.

   * Start `mysqld' with `--log-bin'. *Note Binary log::.  If you want
     to find a query that crashes `mysqld', you should use `--log
     --log-bin'.

   * When you have gotten a crashed table, stop the `mysqld server'.

   * Restore the backup.

   * Restart the `mysqld' server *without* `--log-bin'

   * Re-execute the commands with `mysqlbinlog update-log-file | mysql'.
     The update log is saved in the MySQL database directory with the
     name `hostname-bin.#'.

   * If the tables are corrupted again or you can get `mysqld' to die
     with the above command, you have found reproducible bug that
     should be easy to fix! FTP the tables and the binary log to
     `ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret' and send a mail to
     <bugs@lists.mysql.com> or (if you are a support customer) to
     <support@mysql.com> about the problem and the MySQL team will fix
     it as soon as possible.

You can also use the script `mysql_find_rows' to just execute some of
the update statements if you want to narrow down the problem.


File: mysql.info,  Node: Debugging client,  Next: The DBUG package,  Prev: Debugging server,  Up: Porting

Debugging a MySQL client
========================

To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with `--with-debug'.  *Note configure
options::.

Before running a client, you should set the `MYSQL_DEBUG' environment
variable:

     shell> MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
     shell> export MYSQL_DEBUG

This causes clients to generate a trace file in `/tmp/client.trace'.

If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running `mysql' in debugging mode (assuming you have
compiled MySQL with debugging on):

     shell> mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace

This will provide useful information in case you mail a bug report.
*Note Bug reports::.

If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your `mysql.h' include file matches your mysql library file.  A
very common mistake is to use an old `mysql.h' file from an old MySQL
installation with new MySQL library.


File: mysql.info,  Node: The DBUG package,  Next: Locking methods,  Prev: Debugging client,  Up: Porting

The DBUG package.
=================

The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled with the DBUG
package originally made by Fred Fish.  When one has configured MySQL
for debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace file of
what the program is debugging. *Note Making trace files::.

One uses the debug package by invoking the program with the
`--debug="..."' or the `-#...' option.

Most MySQL programs has a default debug string that will be used if you
don't specify an option to `--debug'.  The default trace file is
usually `/tmp/programname.trace' on Unix and `\programname.trace' on
Windows.

The debug control string is a sequence of colon separated fields as
follows:

     <field_1>:<field_2>:...:<field_N>

Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by an
optional "," and comma-separated list of modifiers:

     flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]

The currently recognized flag characters are:

d       Enable output from DBUG_<N> macros for the current state. May be
        followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the
        DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies
        output for all macros.
D       Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the
        number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine
        capabilities. That is, `-#D,20' is delay two seconds.
f       Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of
        named functions.  Note that a null list will disable all
        functions.	The appropriate "d" or "t" flags must still be
        given, this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.
F       Identify the source file name for each line of debug or trace
        output.
i       Identify the process with the pid or thread id for each line of
        debug or trace output.
g       Enable profiling.  Create a file called 'dbugmon.out' containing
        information that can be used to profile the program.  May be
        followed by a list of keywords that select profiling only for
        the functions in that list.  A null list implies that all
        functions are considered.
L       Identify the source file line number for each line of debug or
        trace output.
n       Print the current function nesting depth for each line of debug
        or trace output.
N       Number each line of dbug output.
o       Redirect the debugger output stream to the specified file.  The
        default output is stderr.
O       As `O' but the file is really flushed between each write. When
        needed the file is closed and reopened between each write.
p       Limit debugger actions to specified processes. A process must be
        identified with the DBUG_PROCESS macro and match one in the list
        for debugger actions to occur.
P       Print the current process name for each line of debug or trace
        output.
r       When pushing a new state, do not inherit the previous state's
        function nesting level. Useful when the output is to start at
        the left margin.
S       Do function _sanity(_file_,_line_) at each debugged function
        until _sanity() returns something that differs from 0. (Mostly
        used with safemalloc to find memory leaks)
t       Enable function call/exit trace lines. May be followed by a list
        (containing only one modifier) giving a numeric maximum trace
        level, beyond which no output will occur for either debugging or
        tracing macros.  The default is a compile time option.

Some examples of debug control strings which might appear on a shell
command line (the "-#" is typically used to introduce a control string
to an application program) are:

     -#d:t
     -#d:f,main,subr1:F:L:t,20
     -#d,input,output,files:n
     -#d:t:i:O,\\mysqld.trace

In MySQL, common tags to print (with the `d' option) are:
`enter',`exit',`error',`warning',`info' and `loop'.

Locking methods
===============

Currently MySQL only supports table locking for `ISAM'/`MyISAM' and
`HEAP' tables and page level locking for `BDB' tables. *Note Internal
locking::.  With `MyISAM' tables one can freely mix `INSERT' and
`SELECT' without locks (`Versioning').

Starting in version 3.23.33, you can analyze the table lock contention
on your system by checking `Table_locks_waited' and
`Table_locks_immediate' environment variables.

Some database users claim that MySQL cannot support near the number of
concurrent users because it lacks row-level locking.  This may be true
for some specific applications, but is not generally true. As always
this depends totally on what the application does and what is the
access/update pattern of the data.

Pros for row locking:

   * Fewer lock conflicts when accessing different rows in many threads.

   * Less changes for rollbacks.

   * Makes it possible to lock a single row a long time.

Cons:

   * Takes more memory than page level or table locks.

   * Is slower than page level or table locks when used one a big part
     of the table, because one has to do many more locks.

   * Is definitely much worse than other locks if you do often do `GROUP
     BY' on a large part of the data or if one has to often scan the
     whole table.

   * With higher level locks one can also more easily support locks of
     different types to tune the application as the lock overhead is
     less notable as for row level locks.

Table locks are superior to page level / row level locks in the
following cases:

   * Mostly reads

   * Read and updates on strict keys; This is where one updates or
     deletes a row that can be fetched with one key read:
          UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key#
          DELETE FROM table_name WHERE unique_key=#

   * `SELECT' combined with `INSERT' (and very few `UPDATE''s and
     `DELETE''s.

   * Many scans / `GROUP BY' on the whole table without any writers.

Other options than row / page level locking:

Versioning (like we use in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where you can
have one writer at the same time as many readers.  This means that the
database/table supports different views for the data depending on when
one started to access it. Other names for this are time travel, copy on
write or copy on demand.

Copy on demand is in many case much better than page or row level
locking; The worst case does, however, use much more memory than when
using normal locks.

Instead of using row level locks one can use application level locks.
(Like get_lock/release_lock in MySQL).  This works of course only in
well-behaved applications.

In many cases one can do an educated guess which locking type is best
for the application but generally it's very hard to say that a given
lock type is better than another; Everything depends on the application
and different part of the application may require different lock types.

Here are some tips about locking in MySQL:

On web application most applications do lots of selects, very few
deletes, updates mainly on keys and inserts in some specific tables.
The base MySQL setup is VERY tuned for this.

Concurrent users is not a problem if one doesn't mix updates and selects
that needs to examine many rows in the same table.

If one mixes inserts and deletes on the same table then `INSERT DELAYED'
may be of great help.

One can also use `LOCK TABLES' to speed up things (many updates within
a single lock is much faster than updates without locks).  Splitting
thing to different tables will also helps.

If you get speed problems with the table locks in MySQL, you may be
able to solve these to convert some of your tables to `BDB' tables.
*Note BDB::.

The optimization section in the manual covers a lot of different
aspects of how to tune ones application. *Note Tips::.

Comments about RTS threads
==========================

I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but stumbled on
the following problems:

They use an old version of a lot of POSIX calls and it is very tedious
to make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

Some wrappers are already written. See `mysys/my_pthread.c' for more
info.

At least the following should be changed:

`pthread_get_specific' should use one argument.  `sigwait' should take
two arguments.  A lot of functions (at least `pthread_cond_wait',
`pthread_cond_timedwait') should return the error code on error. Now
they return -1 and set `errno'.

Another problem is that user-level threads use the `ALRM' signal and
this aborts a lot of functions (`read', `write', `open'...).  MySQL
should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is not that easy
to verify it.

The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

To get thread-level alarms I changed `mysys/thr_alarm.c' to wait between
alarms with `pthread_cond_timedwait()', but this aborts with error
`EINTR'.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the following:

   * Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
     This shouldn't take that long.

   * Compile all libraries with the `-DHAVE_rts_threads'.

   * Compile `thr_alarm'.

   * If there are some small differences in the implementation, they
     may be fixed by changing `my_pthread.h' and `my_pthread.c'.

   * Run `thr_alarm'. If it runs without any "warning", "error" or
     aborted messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful
     run on Solaris:
          Main thread: 1
          Thread 0 (5) started
          Thread: 5  Waiting

Differences between different thread packages
=============================================

MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when choosing a
good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very important.

There are at least three types of thread packages:

   * User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
     alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe
     functions with locks. Read, write and select operations are
     usually managed with a thread-specific select that switches to
     another thread if the running threads have to wait for data.  If
     the user thread packages are integrated in the standard libs
     (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread package requires less
     overhead than thread packages that have to map all unsafe calls
     (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
     environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread safe
     so the mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).
     Downside: All mapped calls take a little time and it's quite
     tricky to be able to handle all situations. There are usually also
     some system calls that are not handled by the thread package (like
     MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread scheduling isn't always optimal.

   * User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
     kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
     manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between
     threads.  LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of
     processes. Thread creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest
     are usually left hanging and you must kill them all before
     restarting. Thread switching is somewhat expensive.

   * Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library
     or the kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process,
     but on some systems, `ps' may show the different threads. If one
     thread aborts, the whole process aborts. Most system calls are
     thread safe and should require very little overhead.  Solaris,
     HP-UX, AIX and OSF1 have kernel threads.

In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user level
threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread switching
can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't really
"thread aware".

Environment Variables
*********************

Here is a list of all the environment variables that are used directly
or indirectly by MySQL. Most of these can also be found in other places
in this manual.

Note that any options on the command line will take precedence over
values specified in configuration files and environment variables, and
values in configuration files take precedence over values in environment
variables.

In many cases it's preferable to use a configure file instead of
environment variables to modify the behavior of MySQL. *Note Option
files::.

`CCX'          Set this to your C++ compiler when running configure.
`CC'           Set this to your C compiler when running configure.
`CFLAGS'       Flags for your C compiler when running configure.
`CXXFLAGS'     Flags for your C++ compiler when running configure.
`DBI_USER'     The default user name for Perl DBI.
`DBI_TRACE'    Used when tracing Perl DBI.
`HOME'         The default path for the `mysql' history file is
               `$HOME/.mysql_history'.
`LD_RUN_PATH'  Used to specify where your `libmysqlclient.so' is.
`MYSQL_DEBUG'  Debug-trace options when debugging.
`MYSQL_HISTFILE'The path to the `mysql' history file.
`MYSQL_HOST'   Default host name used by the `mysql' command-line prompt.
`MYSQL_PWD'    The default password when connecting to `mysqld'. Note
               that use of this is insecure!
`MYSQL_TCP_PORT'The default TCP/IP port.
`MYSQL_UNIX_PORT'The default socket; used for connections to `localhost'.
`PATH'         Used by the shell to finds the MySQL programs.
`TMPDIR'       The directory where temporary tables/files are created.
`TZ'           This should be set to your local time zone. *Note
               Timezone problems::.
`UMASK_DIR'    The user-directory creation mask when creating
               directories. Note that this is ANDed with `UMASK'!
`UMASK'        The user-file creation mask when creating files.
`USER'         The default user on Windows to use when connecting to
               `mysqld'.

Description of MySQL regular expression syntax
**********************************************

A regular expression (regex) is a powerful way of specifying a complex
search.

MySQL uses Henry Spencer's implementation of regular expressions, which
is aimed at conformance with POSIX 1003.2. MySQL uses the extended
version.

This is a simplistic reference that skips the details. To get more exact
information, see Henry Spencer's `regex(7)' manual page that is
included in the source distribution. *Note Credits::.

A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest regexp is
one that has no special characters in it. For example, the regexp
`hello' matches `hello' and nothing else.

Non-trivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that
they can match more than one string. For example, the regexp
`hello|word' matches either the string `hello' or the string `word'.

As a more complex example, the regexp `B[an]*s' matches any of the
strings `Bananas', `Baaaaas', `Bs', and any other string starting with
a `B', ending with an `s', and containing any number of `a' or `n'
characters in between.

A regular expression may use any of the following special
characters/constructs:
`^'
     Match the beginning of a string.
          mysql> select "fo\nfo" REGEXP "^fo$";           -> 0
          mysql> select "fofo" REGEXP "^fo";              -> 1

`$'
     Match the end of a string.
          mysql> select "fo\no" REGEXP "^fo\no$";         -> 1
          mysql> select "fo\no" REGEXP "^fo$";            -> 0

`.'
     Match any character (including newline).
          mysql> select "fofo" REGEXP "^f.*";             -> 1
          mysql> select "fo\nfo" REGEXP "^f.*";           -> 1

`a*'
     Match any sequence of zero or more `a' characters.
          mysql> select "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba*n";             -> 1
          mysql> select "Baaan" REGEXP "^Ba*n";           -> 1
          mysql> select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba*n";              -> 1

`a+'
     Match any sequence of one or more `a' characters.
          mysql> select "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba+n";             -> 1
          mysql> select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba+n";              -> 0

`a?'
     Match either zero or one `a' character.
          mysql> select "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba?n";              -> 1
          mysql> select "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba?n";             -> 1
          mysql> select "Baan" REGEXP "^Ba?n";            -> 0

`de|abc'
     Match either of the sequences `de' or `abc'.
          mysql> select "pi" REGEXP "pi|apa";             -> 1
          mysql> select "axe" REGEXP "pi|apa";            -> 0
          mysql> select "apa" REGEXP "pi|apa";            -> 1
          mysql> select "apa" REGEXP "^(pi|apa)$";        -> 1
          mysql> select "pi" REGEXP "^(pi|apa)$";         -> 1
          mysql> select "pix" REGEXP "^(pi|apa)$";        -> 0

`(abc)*'
     Match zero or more instances of the sequence `abc'.
          mysql> select "pi" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";            -> 1
          mysql> select "pip" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";           -> 0
          mysql> select "pipi" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";          -> 1

`{1}'
`{2,3}'
     The is a more general way of writing regexps that match many
     occurrences of the previous atom.
    `a*'
          Can be written as `a{0,}'.

    `a+'
          Can be written as `a{1,}'.

    `a?'
          Can be written as `a{0,1}'.  To be more precise, an atom
     followed by a bound containing one integer `i' and no comma
     matches a sequence of exactly `i' matches of the atom. An atom
     followed by a bound containing one integer `i' and a comma matches
     a sequence of `i' or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed
     by a bound containing two integers `i' and `j' matches a sequence
     of `i' through `j' (inclusive) matches of the atom.

     Both arguments must be in the range from `0' to `RE_DUP_MAX'
     (default 255), inclusive.  If there are two arguments, the second
     must be greater than or equal to the first.

`[a-dX]'
`[^a-dX]'
     Matches any character which is (or is not, if ^ is used) either
     `a', `b', `c', `d' or `X'. To include a literal `]' character, it
     must immediately follow the opening bracket `['.  To include a
     literal `-' character, it must be written first or last. So
     `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit. Any character that does not have
     a defined meaning inside a `[]' pair has no special meaning and
     matches only itself.
          mysql> select "aXbc" REGEXP "[a-dXYZ]";         -> 1
          mysql> select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]$";       -> 0
          mysql> select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]+$";      -> 1
          mysql> select "aXbc" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";     -> 0
          mysql> select "gheis" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";    -> 1
          mysql> select "gheisa" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";   -> 0

`[[.characters.]]'
     The sequence of characters of that collating element. The sequence
     is a single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket
     expression containing a multi-character collating element can thus
     match more than one character, for example, if the collating
     sequence includes a `ch' collating element, then the regular
     expression `[[.ch.]]*c' matches the first five characters of
     `chchcc'.

`[=character_class=]'
     An equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters of
     all collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself.

     For example, if `o' and `(+)' are the members of an equivalence
     class, then `[[=o=]]', `[[=(+)=]]', and `[o(+)]' are all
     synonymous. An equivalence class may not be an endpoint of a range.

`[:character_class:]'
     Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class
     enclosed in `[:' and `:]' stands for the list of all characters
     belonging to that class. Standard character class names are:

     alnum                  digit                  punct
     alpha                  graph                  space
     blank                  lower                  upper
     cntrl                  print                  xdigit

     These stand for the character classes defined in the `ctype(3)'
     manual page. A locale may provide others. A character class may
     not be used as an endpoint of a range.
          mysql> select "justalnums" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";       -> 1
          mysql> select "!!" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";               -> 0

`[[:<:]]'
`[[:>:]]'
     These match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
     respectively.  A word is defined as a sequence of word characters
     which is neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word
     character is an alnum character (as defined by `ctype(3)') or an
     underscore (`_').
          mysql> select "a word a" REGEXP "[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]";      -> 1
          mysql> select "a xword a" REGEXP "[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]";     -> 0

     mysql> select "weeknights" REGEXP "^(wee|week)(knights|nights)$"; -> 1

What is Unireg?
***************

Unireg is our tty interface builder, but it uses a low-level connection
to our ISAM (which is used by MySQL) and because of this it is very
quick. It has existed since 1979 (on Unix in C since ~1986).

Unireg has the following components:

   * One table viewer with updates/browsing.

   * Multi table viewer (with one scrolling region).

   * Table creator. (With lots of column tags you can't create with
     MySQL) This is WYSIWYG (for a tty). You design a screen and Unireg
     prompts for the column specification.

   * Report generator.

   * A lot of utilities (quick import/export of tables to/from text
     files, analysis of table contents...).

   * Powerful multi-table updates (which we use a lot) with a BASIC-like
     language with LOTS of functions.

   * Dynamic languages (at present in Swedish and Finnish). If somebody
     wants an English version there are a few files that would have to
     be translated.

   * The ability to run updates interactively or in a batch.

   * Emacs-like key definitions with keyboard macros.

   * All this in a binary of 800K.

   * The `convform' utility. Converts `.frm' and text files between
     different character sets.

   * The `myisampack' utility. Packs an ISAM table (makes it 50-80%
     smaller). The table can be read by MySQL like an ordinary table.
     Only one record has to be decompressed per access. Cannot handle
     `BLOB' or `TEXT' columns or updates (yet).

We update most of our production databases with the Unireg interface and
serve web pages through MySQL (and in some extreme cases the Unireg
report generator).

Unireg takes about 3M of disk space and works on at least the following
platforms: SunOS 4.x, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, ICL Unix, DNIX, SCO and
MS-DOS.

Unireg is currently only available in Swedish and Finnish.

The price tag for Unireg is 10,000 Swedish kr (about $1500 US), but this
includes support. Unireg is distributed as a binary. (But all the ISAM
sources can be found in MySQL). Usually we compile the binary for the
customer at their site.

All new development is concentrated to MySQL.

want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*********************************

                      Version 2.1, February 1999

     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place -- Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General
Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does _Less_ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the
     terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
     License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
          such function or table, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
     uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this
     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
     executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)

       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user's
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.

       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.

       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.

       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
     the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
==============================================

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It
is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
     USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
     `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1990

That's all there is to it!

Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution
======================================

* Menu:

* Linux-RPM::                   Linux RPM files
* Building clients::            Building client programs

You need the following tools to install a MySQL binary distribution:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution. GNU `tar' is known
     to work.  Sun `tar' is known to have problems.

An alternative installation method under Linux is to use RPM (RedHat
Package Manager) distributions.  *Note Linux-RPM::.

If you run into problems, *PLEASE ALWAYS USE* `mysqlbug' when posting
questions to <mysql@lists.mysql.com>.  Even if the problem isn't a bug,
`mysqlbug' gathers system information that will help others solve your
problem.  By not using `mysqlbug', you lessen the likelihood of getting
a solution to your problem!  You will find `mysqlbug' in the `bin'
directory after you unpack the distribution.  *Note Bug reports::.

The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL binary
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> cd /usr/local
     shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     shell> ln -s mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
     shell> cd mysql
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
     shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
     shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
     shell> chown -R root /usr/local/mysql/bin
     shell> bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

You can add new users using the `bin/mysql_setpermission' script if you
install the `DBI' and `Msql-Mysql-modules' Perl modules.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a binary distribution, follow the steps below, then proceed
to *Note Post-installation::, for post-installation setup and testing:

  1. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it.  In the example below, we unpack
     the distribution under `/usr/local' and create a directory
     `/usr/local/mysql' into which MySQL is installed.  (The following
     instructions therefore assume you have permission to create files
     in `/usr/local'.  If that directory is protected, you will need to
     perform the installation as `root'.)

  2. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

     MySQL binary distributions are provided as compressed `tar'
     archives and have names like `mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz', where
     `VERSION' is a number (for example, `3.21.15'), and `OS' indicates
     the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
     (for example, `pc-linux-gnu-i586').

  3. If you see a binary distribution marked with the `-max' prefix,
     this means that the binary has support for transaction-safe tables
     and other features. *Note `mysqld-max': mysqld-max.  Note that all
     binaries are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

  4. Add a user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group and the `mysql' user.  The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix.  They may also be called `adduser' and
     `addgroup'.  You may wish to call the user and group something
     else instead of `mysql'.

  5. Change into the intended installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local

  6. Unpack the distribution and create the installation directory:

          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
          shell> ln -s mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

     The first command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION-OS'.
     The second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This
     lets you refer more easily to the installation directory as
     `/usr/local/mysql'.

  7. Change into the installation directory:

          shell> cd mysql

     You will find several files and subdirectories in the `mysql'
     directory.  The most important for installation purposes are the
     `bin' and `scripts' subdirectories.

    `bin'
          This directory contains client programs and the server You
          should add the full pathname of this directory to your `PATH'
          environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
          programs properly. *Note Environment variables::.

    `scripts'
          This directory contains the `mysql_install_db' script used to
          initialize the `mysql' database containing the grant tables
          that store the server access permissions.

  8. If you would like to use `mysqlaccess' and have the MySQL
     distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the
     location where `mysqlaccess' expects to find the `mysql' client.
     Edit the `bin/mysqlaccess' script at approximately line 18.
     Search for a line that looks like this:

          $MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable

     Change the path to reflect the location where `mysql' actually is
     stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a
     `Broken pipe' error when you run `mysqlaccess'.

  9. Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
     installed MySQL before):
          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
     MySQL server when you run `mysql_install_db'.  This is no longer
     true!

 10. Change ownership of binaries to `root' and ownership of the data
     directory to the user that you will run `mysqld' as:

          shell> chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql
          shell> chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
          shell> chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql

     The first command changes the `owner' attribute of the files to the
     `root' user, the second one changes the `owner' attribute of the
     data directory to the `mysql' user, and the third one changes the
     `group' attribute to the `mysql' group.

 11. If you want to install support for the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' interface,
     see *Note Perl support::.

 12. If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files.  More information can be
     found in the `support-files/mysql.server' script itself and in
     *Note Automatic start::.


After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should initialize
and test your distribution.

You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

     shell> bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

*Note `safe_mysqld': safe_mysqld.

*Note Post-installation::.

Installing Perl on Unix
-----------------------

Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the `DBI'/`DBD' client
interface.  *Note Perl::.  The Perl `DBD'/`DBI' client code requires
Perl Version 5.004 or later.  The interface *will not work* if you have
an older version of Perl.

MySQL Perl support also requires that you've installed MySQL client
programming support.  If you installed MySQL from RPM files, client
programs are in the client RPM, but client programming support is in
the developer RPM.  Make sure you've installed the latter RPM.

As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is distributed separately from the
main MySQL distribution.  If you want to install Perl support, the files
you will need can be obtained from
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/'.

The Perl distributions are provided as compressed `tar' archives and
have names like `MODULE-VERSION.tar.gz', where `MODULE' is the module
name and `VERSION' is the version number.  You should get the
`Data-Dumper', `DBI', and `Msql-Mysql-modules' distributions and
install them in that order.  The installation procedure is shown below.
The example shown is for the `Data-Dumper' module, but the procedure is
the same for all three distributions:

  1. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
          shell> gunzip < Data-Dumper-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     This command creates a directory named `Data-Dumper-VERSION'.

  2. Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:
          shell> cd Data-Dumper-VERSION

  3. Build the distribution and compile everything:
          shell> perl Makefile.PL
          shell> make
          shell> make test
          shell> make install

The `make test' command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
`Msql-Mysql-modules' installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the `Msql-Mysql-modules'
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL, particularly
if you notice symptoms such as all your `DBI' scripts dumping core
after you upgrade MySQL.

If you don't have the right to install Perl modules in the system
directory or if you to install local Perl modules, the following
reference may help you:

     `http://www.iserver.com/support/contrib/perl5/modules.html'

Installed Modules'.

Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows
--------------------------------------

To install the MySQL `DBD' module with ActiveState Perl on Windows, you
should do the following:

   * Get ActiveState Perl from
     `http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/index.html' and
     install it.

   * Open a DOS shell.

   * If required, set the HTTP_proxy variable. For example, you might
     try:

          set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128

   * Start the PPM program:

          C:\> c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl

   * If you have not already done so, install `DBI':

          ppm> install DBI

   * If this succeeds, run the following command:

          install ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd

The above should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

If you can't get the above to work, you should instead install the
*MyODBC* driver and connect to MySQL server through ODBC:

     use DBI;
     $dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn","$user","$password") ||
       die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";


File: mysql.info,  Node: Windows Perl,  Next: Perl support problems,  Prev: ActiveState Perl,  Up: Perl support

Installing the MySQL Perl Distribution on Windows
-------------------------------------------------

The MySQL Perl distribution contains `DBI', `DBD:MySQL' and `DBD:ODBC'.

   * Get the Perl distribution for Windows from
     `http://www.mysql.com/download.html'.

   * Unzip the distribution in `C:' so that you get a `C:\PERL'
     directory.

Problems Using the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' Interface
---------------------------------------------

If Perl reports that it can't find the `../mysql/mysql.so' module, then
the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
`libmysqlclient.so'.

You can fix this by any of the following methods:

   * Compile the `Msql-Mysql-modules' distribution with `perl
     Makefile.PL -static -config' rather than `perl Makefile.PL'.

   * Copy `libmysqlclient.so' to the directory where your other shared
     libraries are located (probably `/usr/lib' or `/lib').

   * On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
     `libmysqlclient.so' is located to the `/etc/ld.so.conf' file.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable.

If you get the following errors from `DBD-mysql', you are probably
using `gcc' (or using an old binary compiled with `gcc'):

     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'

Add `-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc' to the link command when the
`mysql.so' library gets built (check the output from `make' for
`mysql.so' when you compile the Perl client).  The `-L' option should
specify the pathname of the directory where `libgcc.a' is located on
your system.

Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with `gcc'.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with `gcc'.

If you get the following error from `Msql-Mysql-modules' when you run
the tests:

     t/00base............install_driver(mysql) failed: Can't load '../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so' for module DBD::mysql: ../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so: undefined symbol: uncompress at /usr/lib/perl5/5.00503/i586-linux/DynaLoader.pm line 169.

it means that you need to include the compression library, -lz, to the
link line. This can be doing the following change in the file
`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm':

     $sysliblist .= " -lm";
     
     to
     
     $sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";

After this, you MUST run 'make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of Perl
that includes `DBI' and `DBD-mysql'.  The way this works is that you
generate a version of Perl with the `DBI' code linked in and install it
on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to build a version of
Perl that additionally has the `DBD' code linked in, and install that.

On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
     or
     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/skunk/man:

First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked `DBI' by running
these commands in the directory where your `DBI' distribution is
located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Then you must install the new Perl. The output of `make perl' will
indicate the exact `make' command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is `make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl
MAP_TARGET=perl'.

Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also
includes a statically-linked `DBD::mysql' by running these commands in
the directory where your `Msql-Mysql-modules' distribution is located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of `make
perl' indicates the command to use.

Functions for Use with `GROUP BY' Clauses
=========================================

If you use a group function in a statement containing no `GROUP BY'
clause, it is equivalent to grouping on all rows.

`COUNT(expr)'
     Returns a count of the number of non-`NULL' values in the rows
     retrieved by a `SELECT' statement:

          mysql> select student.student_name,COUNT(*)
                     from student,course
                     where student.student_id=course.student_id
                     GROUP BY student_name;

     `COUNT(*)' is somewhat different in that it returns a count of the
     number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain `NULL'
     values.

     `COUNT(*)' is optimized to return very quickly if the `SELECT'
     retrieves from one table, no other columns are retrieved, and
     there is no `WHERE' clause.  For example:

          mysql> select COUNT(*) from student;

`COUNT(DISTINCT expr,[expr...])'
     Returns a count of the number of different non-`NULL' values:

          mysql> select COUNT(DISTINCT results) from student;

     In MySQL you can get the number of distinct expression
     combinations that don't contain NULL by giving a list of
     expressions.  In ANSI SQL you would have to do a concatenation of
     all expressions inside `CODE(DISTINCT ..)'.

`AVG(expr)'
     Returns the average value of `expr':

          mysql> select student_name, AVG(test_score)
                     from student
                     GROUP BY student_name;

`MIN(expr)'
`MAX(expr)'
     Returns the minimum or maximum value of `expr'.  `MIN()' and
     `MAX()' may take a string argument; in such cases they return the
     minimum or maximum string value. *Note MySQL indexes::.

          mysql> select student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)
                     from student
                     GROUP BY student_name;

`SUM(expr)'
     Returns the sum of `expr'.  Note that if the return set has no
     rows, it returns NULL!

`STD(expr)'
`STDDEV(expr)'
     Returns the standard deviation of `expr'. This is an extension to
     ANSI SQL. The `STDDEV()' form of this function is provided for
     Oracle compatibility.

`BIT_OR(expr)'
     Returns the bitwise `OR' of all bits in `expr'. The calculation is
     performed with 64-bit (`BIGINT') precision.

`BIT_AND(expr)'
     Returns the bitwise `AND' of all bits in `expr'. The calculation is
     performed with 64-bit (`BIGINT') precision.

MySQL has extended the use of `GROUP BY'. You can use columns or
calculations in the `SELECT' expressions that don't appear in the
`GROUP BY' part. This stands for _any possible value for this group_.
You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
`customer.name' in the following query:

     mysql> select order.custid,customer.name,max(payments)
            from order,customer
            where order.custid = customer.custid
            GROUP BY order.custid;

In ANSI SQL, you would have to add `customer.name' to the `GROUP BY'
clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in ANSI mode.

*Don't use this feature* if the columns you omit from the `GROUP BY'
part aren't unique in the group!  You will get unpredictable results.

In some cases, you can use `MIN()' and `MAX()' to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
`column' from the row containing the smallest value in the `sort'
column:

     substr(MIN(concat(rpad(sort,6,' '),column)),7)

*Note example-Maximum-column-group-row::.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22 (or earlier) or if you
are trying to follow ANSI SQL, you can't use expressions in `GROUP BY'
or `ORDER BY' clauses.  You can work around this limitation by using an
alias for the expression:

     mysql> SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) AS val FROM tbl_name
                GROUP BY id,val ORDER BY val;

In MySQL Version 3.23 you can do:

     mysql> SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) FROM tbl_name ORDER BY RAND();
