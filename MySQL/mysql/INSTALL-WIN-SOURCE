2.9.6 Installing MySQL from Source on Windows
---------------------------------------------

* Menu:

* windows-vc-plus-plus-build::   Building MySQL Using VC++
* windows-bitkeeper-build::      Creating a Windows Source Package from the Latest Development Source

These instructions describe how to build binaries from source for MySQL
4.1 and up on Windows. Instructions are provided for building binaries
from a standard source distribution or from the BitKeeper tree that
contains the latest development source.

*Note*: The instructions here are strictly for users who want to test
MySQL on Windows from the latest source distribution or from the
BitKeeper tree. For production use, MySQL AB does not advise using a
MySQL server built by yourself from source. Normally, it is best to use
precompiled binary distributions of MySQL that are built specifically
for optimal performance on Windows by MySQL AB.  Instructions for
installing a binary distributions are available in *Note
windows-installation::.

To build MySQL on Windows from source, you need the following compiler
and resources available on your Windows system:

   * Visual Studio .Net 2003 (7.1) compiler system

   * Between 3GB and 5GB disk space.

   * Windows XP, Windows 2000 or higher.

The exact system requirements can be found here:
`http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/Previous/2003/sysreqs/default.aspx'

You also need a MySQL source distribution for Windows. For MySQL 4.1
and up, there are two ways to obtain a source distribution:

  1. Obtain a Windows source distribution packaged by MySQL AB for the
     particular version of MySQL in which you are interested. These are
     available from `http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/'.

  2. You can package a source distribution yourself from the latest
     BitKeeper developer source tree. If you plan to do this, you must
     create the package on a Unix system and then transfer it to your
     Windows system. (Some of the configuration and build steps require
     tools that work only on Unix.) The BitKeeper approach thus
     requires:

        * A system running Unix, or a Unix-like system such as Linux.

        * BitKeeper installed on that system. See *Note
          installing-source-tree::, for instructions how to download
          and install BitKeeper.

If you are using a Windows source distribution, you can go directly to
*Note windows-vc-plus-plus-build::. To build from the BitKeeper tree,
proceed to *Note windows-bitkeeper-build::.

If you find something not working as expected, or you have suggestions
about ways to improve the current build process on Windows, please send
a message to the `win32' mailing list. See *Note mailing-lists::.

2.9.6.1 Building MySQL Using VC++
.................................

*Note*: VC++ workspace files for MySQL 4.1 and above are compatible
with Microsoft Visual Studio 7.1 and tested by MySQL AB staff before
each release.

Follow this procedure to build MySQL:

  1. Create a work directory (for example, `C:\workdir').

  2. Unpack the source distribution in the aforementioned directory
     using `WinZip' or other Windows tool that can read `.zip' files.

  3. Start Visual Studio .Net 2003 (7.1).

  4. From the `File menu', select `Open Solution...'.

  5. Open the `mysql.sln' solution you find in the work directory.

  6. From the `Build' menu, select `Configuration Manager...'.

  7. In the `Active Solution Configuration' pop-up menu, select the
     configuration to use. You likely want to use one of `nt' (normal
     server, not for Windows 98/ME), `Max nt' (more engines and
     features, not for 98/ME) or `Debug' configuration.

  8. From the `Build' menu, select `Build Solution'.

  9. Debug versions of the programs and libraries are placed in the
     `client_debug' and `lib_debug' directories. Release versions of
     the programs and libraries are placed in the `client_release' and
     `lib_release' directories.

 10. Test the server. The server built using the preceding instructions
     expects that the MySQL base directory and data directory are
     `C:\mysql' and `C:\mysql\data' by default. If you want to test
     your server using the source tree root directory and its data
     directory as the base directory and data directory, you need to
     tell the server their pathnames.  You can either do this on the
     command line with the `--basedir' and `--datadir' options, or by
     placing appropriate options in an option file. (See *Note
     option-files::.) If you have an existing data directory elsewhere
     that you want to use, you can specify its pathname instead.

 11. Start your server from the `client_release' or `client_debug'
     directory, depending on which server you built or want to use. The
     general server startup instructions are in *Note
     windows-installation::. You must adapt the instructions
     appropriately if you want to use a different base directory or
     data directory.

 12. When the server is running in standalone fashion or as a service
     based on your configuration, try to connect to it from the `mysql'
     interactive command-line utility that exists in your
     `client_release' or `client_debug' directory.

When you are satisfied that the programs you have built are working
correctly, stop the server. Then install MySQL as follows:

  1. Create the directories where you want to install MySQL.  For
     example, to install into `C:\mysql', use these commands:

          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\bin
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\data
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\share
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\scripts

     If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you
     should also create several additional directories:

          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\include
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib\debug
          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib\opt

     If you want to benchmark MySQL, create this directory:

          C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\sql-bench

     Benchmarking requires Perl support. See *Note perl-support::.

  2. From the `workdir' directory, copy into the `C:\mysql' directory
     the following directories:

          C:\> cd \workdir
          C:\workdir> copy client_release\*.exe C:\mysql\bin
          C:\workdir> copy client_debug\mysqld.exe C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-debug.exe
          C:\workdir> xcopy scripts\*.* C:\mysql\scripts /E
          C:\workdir> xcopy share\*.* C:\mysql\share /E

     If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you
     should also copy several libraries and header files:

          C:\workdir> copy lib_debug\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\debug
          C:\workdir> copy lib_debug\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
          C:\workdir> copy lib_debug\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
          C:\workdir> copy lib_release\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\opt
          C:\workdir> copy lib_release\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
          C:\workdir> copy lib_release\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
          C:\workdir> copy include\*.h C:\mysql\include
          C:\workdir> copy libmysql\libmysql.def C:\mysql\include

     If you want to benchmark MySQL, you should also do this:

          C:\workdir> xcopy sql-bench\*.* C:\mysql\bench /E

Set up and start the server in the same way as for the binary Windows
distribution. See *Note windows-installation::.

2.9.6.2 Creating a Windows Source Package from the Latest Development Source
............................................................................

To create a Windows source package from the current BitKeeper source
tree, use the instructions here. This procedure must be performed on a
system running a Unix or Unix-like operating system because some of the
configuration and build steps require tools that work only on Unix. For
example, the following procedure is known to work well on Linux.

  1. Copy the BitKeeper source tree for MySQL 4.1 (or above, as
     desired). For instructions on how to do this, see *Note
     installing-source-tree::.

  2. Configure and build the distribution so that you have a server
     binary to work with. One way to do this is to run the following
     command in the top-level directory of your source tree:

          shell> ./BUILD/compile-pentium-max

  3. After making sure that the build process completed successfully,
     run the following utility script from top-level directory of your
     source tree:

          shell> ./scripts/make_win_src_distribution

     This script creates a Windows source package to be used on your
     Windows system. You can supply different options to the script
     based on your needs. It accepts the following options:

        * `--help'

          Display a help message.

        * `--debug'

          Print information about script operations, do not create
          package.

        * `--tmp'

          Specify the temporary location.

        * `--suffix'

          The suffix name for the package.

        * `--dirname'

          Directory name to copy files (intermediate).

        * `--silent'

          Do not print verbose list of files processed.

        * `--tar'

          Create `tar.gz' package instead of `.zip' package.

     By default, `make_win_src_distribution' creates a Zip-format
     archive with the name `mysql-VERSION-win-src.zip', where VERSION
     represents the version of your MySQL source tree.

  4. Copy or upload the Windows source package that you have just
     created to your Windows machine. To compile it, use the
     instructions in *Note windows-vc-plus-plus-build::.

2.9.7 Compiling MySQL Clients on Windows
----------------------------------------

In your source files, you should include `my_global.h' before `mysql.h':

     #include <my_global.h>
     #include <mysql.h>

`my_global.h' includes any other files needed for Windows compatibility
(such as `windows.h') if you compile your program on Windows.

You can either link your code with the dynamic `libmysql.lib' library,
which is just a wrapper to load in `libmysql.dll' on demand, or link
with the static `mysqlclient.lib' library.

The MySQL client libraries are compiled as threaded libraries, so you
should also compile your code to be multi-threaded.
