This chapter describes how to obtain and install MySQL:

  1. *Determine whether your platform is supported.*  Please note that
     not all supported systems are equally good for running MySQL on
     them.  On some it is much more robust and efficient than others.
     See *Note Which OS:: for details.

  2. *Choose a distribution to install.*  Several versions of MySQL are
     available, and most are available in serveral distribution
     formats.  You can choose from pre-packaged distributions
     containing binary (precompiled) programs or source code.  When in
     doubt, use a binary distribution.  We also provide public access
     to our current source tree, for those who want to see our most
     recent developments and help us test new code.  To determine which
     version and type of distribution you should use, see *Note Which
     version::.

  3. *Download the distribution that you want to install.* For a list
     of sites from which you can obtain MySQL, see *Note Getting MySQL:
     Getting MySQL.  You can verify the integrity of the distribution
     using the instructions in *Note Verifying Package Integrity::.

  4. *Install the distribution.*  For binary distributions, use the
     instructions in in *Note Installing binary::.  For source
     distributions, use the instructions in *Note Installing source::.
     Additional installation procedures include the following:

        * For post-installation procedures, see *Note
          Post-installation::.  These procedures apply whether you
          install MySQL using a binary or source distribution.

        * If you plan to upgrade an existing version of MySQL to a
          newer version rather than installing MySQL for the first
          time, see *Note Upgrade:: for information about upgrade
          procedures and about issues that you should consider before
          upgrading.

        * If you want to run the MySQL benchmark scripts, Perl support
          for MySQL must be available.  *Note Perl support::.



The last part of the chapter provides information on system-specific
problems you may run into.


General Installation Issues
===========================

Before installing MySQL, you should do the following:

  1. Determine whether or not MySQL runs on your platform.

  2. Choose a distribution to install.

  3. Download the distribution and verify its integrity.


This section contains the information necessary to carry out these
steps.  After doing so, you can use the instructions in later sections
of the chapter to install the distribution that you choose.

Operating Systems Supported by MySQL
------------------------------------

This section lists the operating systems on which you can expect to be
able to run MySQL.

We use GNU Autoconf, so it is possible to port MySQL to all modern
systems that have a C++ compiler and a working implementation of POSIX
threads.  (Thread suport is needed for the server. To compile only the
client code, the only requirement is a C++ compiler.) We use and
develop the software ourselves primarily on Linux (SuSE and Red Hat),
FreeBSD, and Sun Solaris (Versions 8 and 9).

MySQL has been reported to compile successfully on the following
combinations of operating system and thread package.  Note that for many
operating systems, native thread support works only in the latest
versions.

   * AIX 4.x, 5.x with native threads.  *Note IBM-AIX::.

   * Amiga.

   * BSDI 2.x with the MIT-pthreads package.  *Note BSDI::.

   * BSDI 3.0, 3.1 and 4.x with native threads.  *Note BSDI::.

   * DEC Unix 4.x with native threads.  *Note Alpha-DEC-UNIX::.

   * FreeBSD 2.x with the MIT-pthreads package.  *Note FreeBSD::.

   * FreeBSD 3.x and 4.x with native threads.  *Note FreeBSD::.

   * FreeBSD 4.x with Linuxthreads.  *Note FreeBSD::.

   * HP-UX 10.20 with the DCE threads or the MIT-pthreads package.
     *Note HP-UX 10.20::.

   * HP-UX 11.x with the native threads.  *Note HP-UX 11.x::.

   * Linux 2.0+ with LinuxThreads 0.7.1+ or `glibc' 2.0.7+.  *Note
     Linux::.

   * Mac OS X.  *Note Mac OS X::.

   * NetBSD 1.3/1.4 Intel and NetBSD 1.3 Alpha (Requires GNU make).
     *Note NetBSD::.

   * Novell NetWare 6.0.  *Note NetWare installation::.

   * OpenBSD > 2.5 with native threads. OpenBSD < 2.5 with the
     MIT-pthreads package.  *Note OpenBSD::.

   * OS/2 Warp 3, FixPack 29 and OS/2 Warp 4, FixPack 4.  *Note OS/2::.

   * SCO OpenServer with a recent port of the FSU Pthreads package.
     *Note SCO::.

   * SCO UnixWare 7.1.x.  *Note SCO UnixWare::.

   * SGI Irix 6.x with native threads.  *Note SGI-Irix::.

   * Solaris 2.5 and above with native threads on SPARC and x86.  *Note
     Solaris::.

   * SunOS 4.x with the MIT-pthreads package.  *Note Solaris::.

   * Tru64 Unix

   * Windows 9x, Me, NT, 2000, and XP.  *Note Windows installation::.

Not all platforms are equally well-suited for running MySQL. How well a
certain platform is suited for a high-load mission-critical MySQL
server is determined by the following factors:

   * General stability of the thread library. A platform may have an
     excellent reputation otherwise, but MySQL will be only as stable
     as the thread library if that library is unstable in the code that
     is called by MySQL, even if everything else is perfect.

   * The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage
     of symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems. In other words, when a
     process creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to
     run on a different CPU than the original process.

   * The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many
     threads which acquire and release a mutex over a short critical
     region frequently without excessive context switches. In other
     words, if the implementation of `pthread_mutex_lock()' is too
     anxious to yield CPU time, this will hurt MySQL tremendously. If
     this issue is not taken care of, adding extra CPUs will actually
     make MySQL slower.

   * General filesystem stability and performance.

   * If your tables are big, the ability of the filesystem to deal with
     large files at all and to deal with them efficiently.

   * Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we
     know a platform well, we enable platform-specific optimizations
     and fixes at compile time. We can also provide advice on
     configuring your system optimally for MySQL.

   * The amount of testing we have done internally for similar
     configurations.

   * The number of users that have successfully run MySQL on that
     platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the
     chances of encountering platform-specific surprises are much
     smaller.

Based on the preceding criteria, the best platforms for running MySQL
at this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 8.2, 2.4 kernel, and ReiserFS (or
any similar Linux distribution) and SPARC with Solaris (2.7-9). FreeBSD
comes third, but we really hope it will join the top club once the
thread library is improved. We also hope that at some point we will be
able to include into the top category all other platforms on which
MySQL currently compiles and runs okay, but not quite with the same
level of stability and performance.  This will require some effort on
our part in cooperation with the developers of the operating system and
library components that MySQL depends on. If you are interested in
improving one of those components, are in a position to influence its
development, and need more detailed instructions on what MySQL needs to
run better, send an email message to the MySQL internals mailing list.
*Note Mailing-list::.

Please note that the purpose of the preceding comparison is not to say
that one operating system is better or worse than another in general.
We are talking only about choosing an OS for the specific purpose of
running MySQL.  With this in mind, the result of this comparison would
be different if we considered more factors. And in some cases, the
reason one OS is better than the other could simply be that we have put
forth more effort into testing on and optimizing for that particular
platform.  We are just stating our observations to help you decide
which platform to use MySQL in your setup.


Choosing Which MySQL Distribution to Install
--------------------------------------------

When preparing to install MySQL, you should decide which version to
use.  MySQL development occurs in several release series, and you can
pick the one that best fits your needs.  After deciding which version
to install, you can choose a distribution format.  Releases are
available in binary or source format.

* Menu:

* Choosing version::            Choosing Which Version of MySQL to Install
* Choosing distribution format::  Choosing a Distribution Format
* Many versions::               How and When Updates Are Released
* Release philosophy::          Release Philosophy---No Known Bugs in Releases
* MySQL binaries::              MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB


Choosing Which Version of MySQL to Install
..........................................

The first decision to make is whether you want to use a production
(stable) release or a development release.  In the MySQL development
process, multiple release series co-exist, each at a different stage of
maturity:

   * MySQL 5.0 is the newest development release series and is under
     very active development for new features. Until recently it was
     available only in preview form from the BitKeeper source
     repository. An early alpha release has now been issued to allow
     more widespread testing.

   * MySQL 4.1 is a development release series to which major new
     features have been added. It is still at alpha status. Sources and
     binaries are available for use and testing on development systems.

   * MySQL 4.0 is the current stable/production-quality release series.
     New releases are issued for bugfixes. No new features are added
     that could diminish the code stability.

   * MySQL 3.23 is the old stable/production-quality release series.
     This series is retired, so new releases are issued only to fix
     critical bugs.


We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves out bug
fixes and things that "must be done."  "Somewhat frozen" means that we
may add small things that "almost surely will not affect anything
that's already working." Naturally, relevant bugfixes from an earlier
series propagate to later series.

   * Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or
     trying to port it to some system for which there is no binary
     distribution, we recommend going with the production release
     series. Currently this is MySQL 4.0.  Note that all MySQL
     releases, even those from development series, are checked with the
     MySQL benchmarks and an extensive test suite before being issued.

   * If you are running an old system and want to upgrade, but don't
     want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you should
     upgrade to the latest version in the same release series you are
     using (where only the last part of the version number is newer
     than yours).  We have tried to fix only fatal bugs and make small,
     relatively safe changes to that version.

   * If you want to use new features not present in the production
     release series, you can use a version from a development series.
     Note that development releases are not as stable as production
     releases.

   * If you want to use the very latest sources containing all current
     patches and bugfixes, you can use one of our BitKeeper
     repositories.  These are not "releases" as such, but are available
     as previews of the code on which future releases will be based.

The MySQL naming scheme uses release names that consist of three
numbers and a suffix, for example, `mysql-4.1.0-alpha'.  The numbers
within the release name are is interpreted like this:

   * The first number (`4') is the major version and also describes the
     file format.  All Version 4 releases have the same file format.

   * The second number (`1') is the release level.  Taken together, the
     major version and release level constitute the release series
     number.

   * The third number (`0') is the version number within the release
     series.  This is incremented for each new release.  Usually you
     want the latest version for the series you have chosen.


For each minor update, the last number in the version string is
incremented.  When there are major new features or minor
incompatibilities with previous versions, the second number in the
version string is incremented.  When the file format changes, the first
number is increased.

Release names also include a suffix to indicates the stability level of
the release.  Releases within a series progress through a set of
suffixes to indicate how the stability level improves.  The possible
suffixes are:

   * `alpha' indicates that the release contains some large section of
     new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs (usually there
     are none) should be documented in the News section.  *Note News::.
     There are also new commands and extensions in most alpha
     releases.  Active development that may involve major code changes
     can occur in an alpha release, but everything will be tested
     before issuing a release.  For this reason, there should be no
     known bugs in any MySQL release.

   * `beta' means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
     features that could cause corruption in old code are added.  There
     should be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha to beta
     when there haven't been any reported fatal bugs within an alpha
     version for at least a month and we have no plans to add any
     features that could make any old command unreliable.

   * `gamma' is a beta that has been around a while and seems to work
     fine.  Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many other
     companies call a release.

   * If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run for a
     while at many different sites with no reports of bugs other than
     platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes are applied to the
     release. This is what we call a production (stable) release.

MySQL uses a naming scheme that is slightly different from most other
products.  In general, it's relatively safe to use any version that has
been out for a couple of weeks without being replaced with a new
version within the release series.

All releases of MySQL are run through our standard tests and benchmarks
to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the standard
tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

Note that all releases have been tested at least with:

An internal test suite
     The `mysql-test' directory contains an extensive set of test cases.
     We run these tests for virtually every server binary.  See *Note
     MySQL test suite:: for more information about this test suite.

The MySQL benchmark suite
     This suite runs a range of common queries.  It is also a test to
     see whether the latest batch of optimizations actually made the
     code faster.  *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

The `crash-me' test
     This test tries to determine what features the database supports
     and what its capabilities and limitations are.  *Note MySQL
     Benchmarks::.

Another test is that we use the newest MySQL version in our internal
production environment, on at least one machine.  We have more than 100
gigabytes of data to work with.


Choosing a Distribution Format
..............................

After choosing which version of MySQL to install, you should decide
whether to use a binary distribution or a source distribution.  In most
cases you should probably use a binary distribution, if one exists for
your platform. Binary distributions are available in native format for
many platforms, such as RPM files for Linux or DMG package installers
for Mac OS X. Distributions also are available as Zip archives or
compressed `tar' files.

Reasons to choose a binary distribution include the following:

   * Binary distributions generally are easier to install than source
     distributions.

   * To satisfy different user requirements, we provide two different
     binary versions: one compiled with the non-transactional storage
     engines (a small, fast binary), and one configured with the most
     important extended options like transaction-safe tables.  Both
     versions are compiled from the same source distribution.  All
     native MySQL clients can connect to both MySQL versions.

     The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the `-max'
     suffix and is configured with the same options as `mysqld-max'.
     *Note `mysqld-max': mysqld-max.

     If you want to use the `MySQL-Max' RPM, you must first install the
     standard `MySQL-server' RPM.


Circumstances under which you probably will be better off with a source
installation include the following:

   * You want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  The standard
     binary distributions are "ready to run" at any place, but you may
     want to have even more flexibility to place MySQL components where
     you want.

   * You want to configure `mysqld' with some extra features that are
     not in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the
     most common extra options that you may want to use:

        * `--with-innodb' (default for MySQL 4.0 and onwards)

        * `--with-berkeley-db' (not available on all platforms)

        * `--with-raid'

        * `--with-libwrap'

        * `--with-named-z-libs' (This is done for some of the binaries)

        * `--with-debug[=full]'

   * You want to configure `mysqld' without some features that are
     included in the standard binary distributions. For example,
     distributions normally are compiled with support for all character
     sets. If you want a smaller MySQL server, you can recompile it
     with support for only the character sets you need.

   * You have a special compiler (like `pgcc') or want to use compiler
     options that are better optimized for your processor.  Binary
     distributions are compiled with options that should work on a
     variety of processors from the same processor family.

   * You want to use the latest sources from one of the BitKeeper
     repositories to have access to all current bugfixes. For example,
     if you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL development
     team, the bugfix will be committed to the source repository and you
     can access it there.  The bugfix will not appear in a release until
     a release actually is issued.

   * You want to read (or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up
     MySQL. For this purpose, you should get a source distribution,
     because the source code is always the ultimate manual.  Source
     distributions also contain more tests and examples than binary
     distributions.



How and When Updates Are Released
.................................

MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we want to share
new developments with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release when
we have very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended email supported customers
want and try to help them out.

No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  *Note News::.

We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

   * Releases are issued within each release series. For each release,
     the last number in the version is one more than the previous
     release within the same series.

   * Production (stable) releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a
     year, but if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes
     will be issued.

   * Working releases/bug fixes to old releases are meant to appear
     about every 4-8 weeks.

   * Binary distributions for some platforms are made by us for major
     releases.  Other people may make binary distributions for other
     systems, but probably less frequently.

   * We usually make fixes available as soon as we have identified and
     corrected small or non-critical but annoying bugs. The fixes are
     available immediately from our public BitKeeper repositories, and
     will be included in the next release.

   * If by any chance a fatal bug is found in a release, we will make a
     new release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies to
     do this, too.


Release Philosophy--No Known Bugs in Releases
.............................................

We put a lot of time and effort into making our releases bug free.  To
our knowledge, we have not released a single MySQL version with any
_known_ "fatal" repeatable bugs.  (A fatal bug is something that
crashes MySQL under normal usage, produces incorrect answers for normal
queries, or has a security problem.)

We have documented all open problems, bugs, and issues that are
dependent on design decisions.  *Note Bugs::.

Our aim is to fix everything that is fixable without risk of making a
stable MySQL version less stable. In certain cases, this means we can
fix an issue in the development versions, but not in the stable
(production) version. Naturally, we document such issues so that users
are aware.

Here is a description of how our build process works:
   * We monitor bugs from our customer support list, the bugs database
     at `http://bugs.mysql.com/', and the MySQL external mailing lists.

   * All reported bugs for live versions are entered into the bugs
     database.

   * When we fix a bug, we always try to make a test case for it and
     include it into our test system to ensure that the bug will never
     recur without being detected. (About 90% of all fixed bugs have a
     test case.)

   * We also create test cases for all new features we add to MySQL.

   * Before we start to build a new MySQL release, we ensure that all
     reported repeatable bugs for the MySQL version (3.23.x, 4.0.x, etc)
     are fixed.  If something is impossible to fix (due to some internal
     design decision in MySQL) we document this in the manual.  *Note
     Bugs::.

   * We do a build on all platforms for which we support binaries (15+
     platforms) and run our test suite and benchmark suite on all of
     them.

   * We will not publish a binary for a platform for which the test or
     benchmark suite fails.  If it's a general error in the source, we
     fix this and do the build plus tests on all systems again, from
     scratch.

   * The build and test process takes 2-3 days).  If we receive a
     report regarding a fatal bug during this process (for example, one
     that causes a core dump), we fix the problem and restart the build
     process.

   * After publishing the binaries on `http://www.mysql.com/', we send
     out an announcement message to the `mysql' and `announce' mailing
     lists.  *Note Mailing-list::.  The announcement message contains a
     list of all changes to the release and any known problems with the
     release.  (The "known problems" section in the release notes has
     only been needed in a handful of releases.)

   * To quickly give our users access to the latest MySQL features, we
     do a new MySQL release every 4-8 weeks.  Source code snapshots are
     built daily and are available at
     `http://downloads.mysql.com/snapshots.php'.

   * If we, after the release is done, get any bug reports that there
     was (after all) anything critically wrong with the build on a
     specific platform, we will fix this at once and build a new `'a''
     release for that platform. Thanks to our large user base, problems
     are found quickly.

   * Our track record for making good releases is quite good.  In the
     last 150 releases, we had to do a new build for less than 10
     releases (in 3 of these cases, the bug was a faulty `glibc'
     library on one of our build machines that took us a long time to
     track down).


MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB
...................................

As a service, we at MySQL AB provide a set of binary distributions of
MySQL that are compiled at our site or at sites where customers kindly
have given us access to their machines.

In addition to the binaries provided in platform-specific package
formats (see *Note Quick Standard Installation::), we do offer binary
distributions for a number of platforms in the form of of compressed
tar files (`.tar.gz').

These distributions are generated using the script
`Build-tools/Do-compile' which compiles the source code and creates the
binary `tar.gz' archive using `scripts/make_binary_distribution' These
binaries are configured and built with the following compilers and
options.

RPM distributions prior to MySQL Version 3.22 are user-contributed.
Beginning with Version 3.22, the RPM distributions are generated by us
at MySQL AB.

If you want to compile a debug version of MySQL, you should add
`--with-debug' or `--with-debug=full' to the preceding configure lines
and remove any `-fomit-frame-pointer' options.

For the Windows distribution, please see *Note Windows installation::.


How to Get MySQL
----------------

Check the MySQL homepage (`http://www.mysql.com/') for information
about the current version and for downloading instructions.

Our main mirror is located at `http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/mysql/'.

For a complete up-to-date list of MySQL web/download mirrors, see
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mirrors.html'.  There you will also
find information about becoming a MySQL mirror site and how to report a
bad or out-of-date mirror.


Verifying Package Integrity Using MD5 Checksums or `GnuPG'
----------------------------------------------------------

After you have downloaded the MySQL package that suits your needs and
before you attempt to install it, you should make sure it is intact and
has not been tampered with.

MySQL AB offers three means of integrity checking:

   * MD5 checksums

   * Cryptographic signatures using `GnuPG', the GNU Privacy Guard

   * For RPM packages, the built-in RPM integrity verification mechanism


The following sections describe how to use these methods.

Verifying the `MD5 Checksum'
----------------------------

After you have downloaded the package, you should make sure that the MD5
checksum matches the one provided on the MySQL download pages. Each
package has an individual checksum that you can verify with the
following command, where `package_name' is the name of the package you
downloaded:

     shell> md5sum package_name

Note, that not all operating systems support the `md5sum' command--on
some it is simply called `md5', others do not ship it at all. On Linux,
it is part of the `GNU Text Utilities' package, which is available for
a wide range of platforms. You can download the source code from
`http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/' as well. If you have `OpenSSL'
installed, you can also use the command `openssl md5 package_name'
instead. A DOS/Windows implementation of the `md5' command is available
from `http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/'.

Example:
     shell> md5sum mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
     60f5fe969d61c8f82e4f7f62657e1f06
                     mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz

You should verify that the resulting checksum (the string of hexadecimal
digits) matches the one displayed on the download page immediately
below the respective package.

Signature Checking Using `GnuPG'
--------------------------------

Another method of verifying the integrity and authenticity of a package
is to use cryptographic signatures. This is more reliable than using MD5
checksums, but requires more work.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 (February 2003), MySQL AB started signing
downloadable packages with `GnuPG' (`GNU Privacy Guard').  `GnuPG' is
an Open Source alternative to the very well-known `Pretty Good Privacy'
(`PGP') by Phil Zimmermann.  See `http://www.gnupg.org/' for more
information about `GnuPG' and how to obtain and install it on your
system. Most Linux distributions already ship with `GnuPG' installed by
default.  For more information about `OpenPGP', see
`http://www.openpgp.org/'.

To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to
obtain a copy of MySQL AB's public GPG build key <build@mysql.com>. You
can either cut and paste it directly from here, or obtain it from
`http://www.keyserver.net/'.

     -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

You can import this key into your public GPG keyring by using `gpg
--import'. See the GPG documentation for more info on how to work with
public keys.

After you have downloaded and imported the public build key, download
your desired MySQL package and the corresponding signature, which also
is available from the download page.  The signature file has the same
name as the distribution file with an `.asc' extension. For example:

Distribution file      `mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz'
Signature file         `mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc'

Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and then run
the following command to verify the signature for the distribution file:

     shell> gpg --verify package_name.asc

Example:

     shell> gpg --verify mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
     gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
     gpg: Signature made Mon 03 Feb 2003 08:50:39 PM MET using DSA key ID 5072E1F5
     gpg: Good signature from
          "MySQL Package signing key (www.mysql.com) <build@mysql.com>"

The "Good signature" message indicates that everything is all right.

Signature Checking Using `RPM'
------------------------------

For RPM packages, there is no separate signature. RPM packages actually
have a built-in GPG signature and MD5 checksum. You can verify a
package by running the following command:

     shell> rpm --checksig package_name.rpm

Example:

     shell> rpm --checksig MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm
     MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK

*Note:* If you are using RPM 4.1 and it complains about `(GPG) NOT OK
(MISSING KEYS: GPG#5072e1f5)' (even though you have imported it into
your GPG public keyring), you need to import the key into the RPM
keyring first. RPM 4.1 no longer uses your GPG keyring (and GPG
itself), but rather maintains its own keyring (because it's a
system-wide application and the GPG public keyring is a user-specific
file). To import the MySQL public key into the RPM keyring, use `rpm
--import'. For example, if you have the public key stored in a file
named `mysql_pubkey.asc', import it using this command:

     shell> rpm --import mysql_pubkey.asc

If you notice that the MD5 checksum or GPG signatures do not match,
first try to download the respective package one more time, perhaps
from another mirror site. If you repeatedly cannot successfully verify
the integrity of the package, please notify us about such incidents
including the full package name and the download site you have been
using at <webmaster@mysql.com> or <build@mysql.com>.  Do not report
downloading problems using the bug-reporting system.


Installation Layouts
--------------------

This section describes the default layout of the directories created by
installing binary and source distributions.

On Windows, the default installation directory is `C:\mysql', which has
the following subdirectories:

*Directory*               *Contents of directory*
`bin'                     Client programs and the
                          `mysqld' server
`data'                    Log files, databases

                          files
`sql-bench'               Benchmarks

On Unix, a `tar' file binary distribution is installed by unpacking it
at the installation location you choose (typically `/usr/local/mysql')
and creates the following directories in that location:

*Directory*               *Contents of directory*
`bin'                     Client programs and the
                          `mysqld' server
`data'                    Log files, databases
`docs'                    Documentation, ChangeLog
`include'                 Include (header) files
`lib'                     Libraries
`scripts'                 `mysql_install_db'
`share/mysql'             Error message files
`sql-bench'               Benchmarks

A source distribution is installed after you configure and compile it.
By default, the installation step installs files under `/usr/local', in
the following subdirectories:

*Directory*               *Contents of directory*
`bin'                     Client programs and scripts
`include/mysql'           Include (header) files
`info'                    Documentation in Info format
`lib/mysql'               Libraries
`libexec'                 The `mysqld' server
`share/mysql'             Error message files
`sql-bench'               Benchmarks and `crash-me' test
`var'                     Databases and log files

Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation
differs from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

   * The `mysqld' server is installed in the `libexec' directory rather
     than in the `bin' directory.

   * The data directory is `var' rather than `data'.

   * `mysql_install_db' is installed in the `bin' directory rather than
     in the `scripts' directory.

   * The header file and library directories are `include/mysql' and
     `lib/mysql' rather than `include' and `lib'.

You can create your own binary installation from a compiled source
distribution by executing the `scripts/make_binary_distribution' script
from the top directory of the source distribution.


Standard MySQL Installation Using a Binary Distribution
=======================================================

This section covers the installation of MySQL on platforms where we
offer packages using the native packaging format of the respective
platform. (This is also known as performing a "binary install.")
However, binary distributions of MySQL are available for many other
platforms as well. See *Note Installing binary:: for generic
installation instructions for these packages that apply to all
platforms.

See *Note General Installation Issues:: for more information on what
other binary distributions are available and how to obtain them.

Installing MySQL on Windows
---------------------------

The installation process for MySQL on Windows has the following steps:

  1. Install the distribution.

  2. Set up an option file if necessary.

  3. Select the server you want to use.

  4. Start the server.

  5. Assign passwords to the initial MySQL accounts.


MySQL for Windows is available in two distribution formats:

   * The binary distribution contains a setup program that installs
     everything you need so that you can start the server immediately.

   * The source distribution contains all the code and support files
     for building the executables using the VC++ 6.0 compiler.


Generally speaking, you should use the binary distribution. It's
simpler, and you need no additional tools to get MySQL up and running.

This section describes how to install MySQL on Windows using a binary
distribution.  To install using a source distribution, see *Note
Windows source build::.

Windows System Requirements
...........................

To run MySQL on Windows, you need the following:

   * A 32-bit Windows operating system such as 9x, Me, NT, 2000, or XP.
     The NT family (Windows NT, 2000, and XP) permits you to run the
     MySQL server as a service. *Note NT start::.

   * TCP/IP protocol support.

   * A copy of the MySQL binary distribution for Windows, which can be
     downloaded from `http://www.mysql.com/downloads/'.

     Note: The distribution files are supplied with a zipped format and
     we recommend the use of an adequate FTP client with resume feature
     to avoid corruption of files during the download process.

   * A `ZIP' program to unpack the distribution file.

   * Enough space on the hard drive to unpack, install, and create the
     databases in accordance with your requirements.

   * If you plan to connect to the MySQL server via ODBC, you also need
     the `MyODBC' driver. *Note ODBC::.

   * If you need tables with a size larger than 4 GB, install MySQL on
     an NTFS or newer filesystem. Don't forget to use `MAX_ROWS' and
     `AVG_ROW_LENGTH' when you create tables.  *Note `CREATE TABLE':
     CREATE TABLE.



Installing a Windows Binary Distribution
........................................

To install MySQL on Windows using a binary distribution, follow this
procedure:

  1. If you are working on a Windows NT, 2000, or XP machine, make sure
     you have logged in as a user with administrator privileges.

  2. If you are doing an upgrade of an earlier MySQL installation, it
     is necessary to stop the current server.  On Windows NT, 2000, or
     XP machines, if you are running the server as a Windows service,
     stop it as follows from the command prompt:

          C:\> NET STOP MySQL

     If you plan to use a different server after the upgrade (for
     example, if you want to run `mysqld-max' rather than `mysqld'),
     remove the existing service:

          C:\mysql\bin> mysqld --remove

     You can reinstall the service to use the proper server after
     upgrading.

     If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, stop it like
     this:

          C:\mysql\bin> mysqladmin -u root shutdown

  3. Exit the `WinMySQLAdmin' program if it is running.

  4. Unzip the distribution file to a temporary directory.

  5. Run the `setup.exe' program to begin the installation process.  If
     you want to install MySQL into a location other than the default
     directory (`C:\mysql'), use the `Browse' button to specify your
     preferred directory. If you do not install MySQL into the default
     location, you will need to specify the location whenever you start
     the server. The easiest way to do this is to use an option file,
     as described in *Note Windows prepare environment::.

  6. Finish the install process.


*Important note:* Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1 do
not contain any installer program.  A 4.1 distribution is a ZIP file
that you just unzip in the location where you want to install MySQL.
For example, to install `mysql-4.1.1-alpha-win.zip' as `C:\mysql', unzip
the distribution file on the `C:' drive, then rename the resulting
`mysql-4.1.1-alpha' directory to `mysql'.

If you are upgrading to MySQL 4.1 from an earlier version, you will
want to preserve your existing `data' directory that contains the grant
tables in the `mysql' database and your own databases.  Before
installing 4.1, stop the server if it is running, and save your `data'
directory to another location. Then either rename the existing
`C:\mysql' directory or remove it.  Install 4.1 as described in the
preceding paragraph, and then replace its `data' directory with your
old `data' directory.  Start the new server and update the grant
tables.  This will avoid loss of your current databases.  *Note
Upgrading-grant-tables::.


Preparing the Windows MySQL Environment
.......................................

If you need to specify startup options when you run the server, you can
indicate them on the command line or place them in an option file. For
options that will be used every time the server starts, you will find
it most convenient to use an option file to specify your MySQL
configuration. This is true particularly under the following
circumstances:

   * The installation or data directory locations are different from
     the default locations (`C:\mysql' and `C:\mysql\data').

   * You need to tune the server settings.  For example, to use the
     `InnoDB' transactional tables in MySQL version 3.23, you must
     manually create two new directories to hold the `InnoDB' data and
     log files--such as, `C:\ibdata' and `C:\iblogs'.  You will also
     need to add some extra lines to the option file, as described in
     *Note `InnoDB' start: InnoDB start.  (As of MySQL 4.0, InnoDB
     creates its datafiles and log files in the data directory by
     default. This means you need not configure InnoDB explicitly.  You
     may still do so if you wish, and an option file will be useful in
     this case, too.)


On Windows, the MySQL installer places the data directory directly under
the directory where you install MySQL.  If you would like to use a data
directory in a different location, you should copy the entire contents
of the `data' directory to the new location. For example, by default,
the installer places MySQL in `C:\mysql' and the data directory in
`C:\mysql\data'. If you want to use a data directory of `E:\mydata',
you must do two things:

   * Move the data directory from `C:\mysql\data' to `E:\mydata'.

   * Use a `--datadir' option to specify the new data directory location
     each time you start the server.


When the MySQL server starts on Windows, it looks for options in two
files:  The `my.ini' file in the Windows directory, and the `C:\my.cnf'
file.  The Windows directory typically is named something like
`C:\WINDOWS' or `C:\WinNT'.  You can determine its exact location from
the value of the `WINDIR' environment variable using the following
command:

     C:\> echo %WINDIR%

MySQL looks for options first in the `my.ini' file, then in the
`my.cnf' file.  However, to avoid confusion, it's best if you use only
one file.  If your PC uses a boot loader where the `C:' drive isn't the
boot drive, your only option is to use the `my.ini' file.  Whichever
one you use, it must be a plain text file.

An option file can be created and modified with any text editor, such
as the `Notepad' program.  For example, if MySQL is installed at
`D:\mysql' and the data directory is located as `D:\mydata\data', you
can create the option file and set up a `[mysqld]' section to specify
values for the `basedir' and `datadir' parameters:

     [mysqld]
     # set basedir to your installation path
     basedir=D:/mysql
     # set datadir to the location of your data directory
     datadir=D:/mydata/data

Note that Windows pathnames are specified in option files using forward
slashes rather than backslashes.  If you do use backslashes, you must
double them.

Another way to manage an option file is to use the the `WinMySQLAdmin'
tool. You can find `WinMySQLAdmin' in the `bin' directory of your MySQL
installation, as well as a help file containing instructions for using
it. `WinMySQLAdmin' has the capability of editing your option file, but
note these points:

   * `WinMySQLAdmin' uses only the `my.ini' file.

   * If `WinMySQLAdmin' finds a `C:\my.cnf' file, it will in fact rename
     it to `C:\my_cnf.bak' to disable it.


Now you are ready to test starting the server.


Selecting a Windows Server
..........................

Starting with MySQL 3.23.38, the Windows distribution includes both the
normal and the MySQL-Max server binaries.  Here is a list of the
different MySQL servers from which you can choose:

*Binary*       *Description*
`mysqld'       Compiled with full debugging and automatic memory
               allocation checking, symbolic links, and `InnoDB' and
               `BDB' tables.
`mysqld-opt'   Optimized binary.  From version 4.0 on, `InnoDB' is
               enabled.  Before 4.0, this server includes no
               transactional table support.
`mysqld-nt'    Optimized binary for NT/2000/XP with support for named
               pipes.
`mysqld-max'   Optimized binary with support for symbolic links, and
               `InnoDB' and `BDB' tables.
`mysqld-max-nt'Like `mysqld-max', but compiled with support for named
               pipes.

All of the preceding binaries are optimized for modern Intel processors
but should work on any Intel i386-class or higher processor.

MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms. The `mysqld-nt' and
`mysql-max-nt' servers support named pipes on NT, 2000, and XP.
However, the default is to use TCP/IP regardless of the platform.
(Named pipes are slower than TCP/IP in many Windows configurations.)

Named pipe use is subject to these conditions:

   * Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only if you
     start the server with the `--enable-named-pipe' option.  It is now
     necessary to use this option explicitly because some users have
     experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when named
     pipes are used.

   * Named pipe connections are allowed only by the `mysqld-nt' or
     `mysqld-max-nt' servers, and only if the server is run on a
     version of Windows that supports named pipes (NT, 2000, XP).

   * These servers can be run on Windows 98 or Me, but only if TCP/IP
     is installed; named pipe connections cannot be used.

   * On Windows 95, these servers cannot be used.



Starting the Server for the First Time
......................................

On Windows 95, 98, or Me, MySQL clients always connect to the server
using TCP/IP.  (This will allow any machine on your network to connect
to your MySQL server.)  Because of this, you must make sure that TCP/IP
support is installed on your machine before starting MySQL.  You can
find TCP/IP on your Windows CD-ROM.

Note that if you are using an old Windows 95 release (for example,
OSR2), it's likely that you have an old Winsock package; MySQL requires
Winsock 2! You can get the newest Winsock from
`http://www.microsoft.com/'.  Windows 98 has the new Winsock 2 library,
so it is unnecessary to update the library.

On NT-based systems such as Windows NT, 2000, or XP, clients have two
options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a named pipe if the server
supports named pipe connections.

For information about which server binary to run, see *Note Windows
prepare environment::.

This section gives a general overview of starting the MySQL server.
The following sections provide more specific information for particular
versions of Windows.

The examples in these sections assume that MySQL is installed under the
default location of `C:\mysql'. Adjust the pathnames shown in the
examples if you have MySQL installed in a different location.

Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window (a "DOS
window"). This way you can have the server display status messages in
the window where they are easy to see.  If something is wrong with your
configuration, these messages will make it easier for you to identify
and fix any problems.

Make sure you are in the directory where the server is located, then
enter this command:

     C:\mysql\bin> mysqld --console

For servers that include `InnoDB' support, you should see the following
messages as the server starts:

     InnoDB: The first specified datafile c:\ibdata\ibdata1 did not exist:
     InnoDB: a new database to be created!
     InnoDB: Setting file c:\ibdata\ibdata1 size to 209715200
     InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
     InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 did not exist: new to be created
     InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 size to 31457280
     InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 did not exist: new to be created
     InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 size to 31457280
     InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 did not exist: new to be created
     InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 size to 31457280
     InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer not found: creating new
     InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer created
     InnoDB: creating foreign key constraint system tables
     InnoDB: foreign key constraint system tables created
     011024 10:58:25  InnoDB: Started

When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see something
like this, which indicates that the server is ready to service client
connections:

     mysqld: ready for connections
     Version: '4.0.14-log'  socket: ''  port: 3306

The server will continue to write to the console any further diagnostic
output it produces.  You can open a new console window in which to run
client programs.

If you omit the `--console' option, the server writes diagnostic output
to the error log in the data directory. The error log is the file with
the `.err' extension.

The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially have no
passwords.  After starting the server, you should set up passwords for
them using the instructions in *Note Post-installation::.


Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line
............................................

The MySQL server can be started manually from the command line.  This
can be done on any version of Windows.

To start the `mysqld' server from the command line, you should start a
console window (a "DOS" window) and enter this command:

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld

On non-NT versions of Windows, this will start `mysqld' in the
background. That is, after the server starts, you should see another
command prompt. If you start the server this way on Windows NT, 2000,
or XP, the server will run in the foreground and no command prompt will
appear until the server exits.  Because of this, you should open
another console window to run client programs while the server is
running.

You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown

This invokes the MySQL administrative utility `mysqladmin' to connect
to the server and tell it to shut down. The command connects as `root',
which is the default administrative account in the MySQL grant system.
Please note that users in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent
from any login users under Windows.

If `mysqld' doesn't start, check the error log to see whether the
server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the problem.
The error log is located in the `C:\mysql\data' directory. It is the
file with a suffix of `.err'. You can also try to start the server as
`mysqld --console'; in this case, you may get some useful information
on the screen that may help solve the problem.

The last option is to start `mysqld' with `--standalone --debug'.  In
this case `mysqld' will write a log file `C:\mysqld.trace' that should
contain the reason why `mysqld' doesn't start. *Note Making trace
files::.

Use `mysqld --help' to display all the options that `mysqld'
understands!


Starting MySQL as a Windows Service
...................................

On the NT family (Windows NT, 2000, or XP), the recommended way to run
MySQL is to install it as a Windows service. Then Windows starts and
stops the MySQL server automatically when Windows starts and stops. A
server installed as a service can also be controlled from the command
line using `NET' commands, or with the graphical `Services' utility.

The `Services' utility (the Windows `Service Control Manager') can be
found in the Windows `Control Panel' (under `Administrative Tools' on
Windows 2000). It is advisable to close the `Services' utility while
performing server installation or removal operations from this command
line.  This prevents some odd errors.

To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on Windows NT 4, you must install
service pack 3 (or newer)!

Before installing MySQL as a Windows service, you should first stop the
current server if it is running by using the following command:

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown

This invokes the MySQL administrative utility `mysqladmin' to connect
to the server and tell it to shut down. The command connects as `root',
which is the default administrative account in the MySQL grant system.
Please note that users in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent
from any login users under Windows.

Now install the server as a service:

     shell> mysqld --install

If you have problems installing `mysqld' as a service using just the
server name, try installing it using its full pathname:

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install

As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can specify a specific service name after the
`--install' option.  As of MySQL 4.0.3, you can in addition specify a
`--defaults-file' option after the service name to indicate where the
server should obtain options when it starts. The rules that determine
the service name and option files the server uses are as follows:

   * If you specify no service name, the server uses the default
     service name of `MySQL' and the server reads options from the
     `[mysqld]' group in the standard option files.

   * If you specify a service name after the `--install' option, the
     server ignores the `[mysqld]' option group and instead reads
     options from the group that has the same name as the service. The
     server reads options from the standard option files.

   * If you specify a `--defaults-file' option after the service name,
     the server ignores the standard option files and reads options
     only from the `[mysqld]' group of the named file.


*Note:* Prior to MySQL 4.0.17, a server installed as a Windows service
has problems starting if its pathname or the service name contains
spaces. For this reason, avoid installing MySQL in a directory such as
`C:\Program Files' or using a service name containing spaces.

In the usual case that you install the server with `--install' but no
service name, the server is installed with a service name of `MySQL'.

As a more complex example, consider the following command (which should
be entered on a single line):

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install mysql
                --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf

Here, a service name is given after the `--install' option. If no
`--defaults-file' option had been given, this command would have the
effect of causing the server to read the `[mysql]' group from the
standard option files. (This would be a bad idea, because that option
group is for use by the `mysql' client program.) However, because the
`--defaults-file' option is present, the server reads options only from
the named file, and only from the `[mysqld]' option group.

You can also specify options as "`Start parameters'" in the Windows
`Services' utility before you start the MySQL service.

Once a MySQL server is installed as a service, Windows will start the
service automatically whenever Windows starts.  The service also can be
started immediately from the `Services' utility, or by using the
command `NET START MySQL'.  The `NET' command is not case sensitive.

Please note that when run as a service, `mysqld' has no access to a
console window, so no messages can be seen there.  If `mysqld' doesn't
start, check the error log to see whether the server wrote any messages
there to indicate the cause of the problem.  The error log is located
in the `C:\mysql\data' directory. It is the file with a suffix of
`.err'.

When `mysqld' is running as a service, it can be stopped by using the
`Services' utility, the command `NET STOP MySQL', or the command
`mysqladmin shutdown'. If the service is running when Windows shuts
down, Windows will stop the server automatically.

From MySQL version 3.23.44, you have the choice of installing the
server as a `Manual' service if you don't wish the service to be
started automatically during the boot process. To do this, use the
`--install-manual' option rather than the `--install' option:

     shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install-manual

To remove a server that is installed as a service, first stop it if it
is running. Then use the `--remove' option to remove it:

     shell> mysqld --remove

For MySQL versions older than 3.23.49, one problem with automatic MySQL
service shutdown is that Windows waited only for a few seconds for the
shutdown to complete, then killed the database server process if the
time limit was exceeded. This had the potential to cause problems.
(For example, the `InnoDB' storage engine had to perform crash recovery
at the next startup.) Starting from MySQL version 3.23.49, Windows
waits longer for the MySQL server shutdown to complete. If you notice
this still is not enough for your installation, it is safest not to run
the MySQL server as a service. Instead, start it from the command-line
prompt, and stop it with `mysqladmin shutdown'.

This change to tell Windows to wait longer when stopping the MySQL
server works for Windows 2000 and XP. It does not work for Windows NT,
where Windows waits only 20 seconds for a service to shut down, and
after that kills the service process. You can increase this default by
opening the Registry Editor `\winnt\system32\regedt32.exe' and editing
the value of `WaitToKillServiceTimeout' at
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control' in the Registry
tree. Specify the new larger value in milliseconds.  For example, the
value 120000 tells Windows NT to wait up to 120 seconds.

If you don't want to start `mysqld' as a service, you can start it from
the command line the same way as for versions of Windows that are not
based on NT.  For instructions, see *Note Win95 start::.


Running MySQL Client Programs on Windows
........................................

You can test whether the MySQL server is working by executing any of the
following commands:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql test

If `mysqld' is slow to respond to TCP/IP connections from client
programs on Windows 9x/Me, there is probably a problem with your DNS.
In this case, start `mysqld' with the `--skip-name-resolve' option and
use only `localhost' and IP numbers in the `Host' column of the MySQL
grant tables.

You can force a MySQL client to use a named pipe connection rather than
TCP/IP  by specifying the `--pipe' option or by specifying `.' (period)
as the host name.  Use the `--socket' option to specify the name of the
pipe.  In MySQL 4.1, you should use the `--protocol=PIPE' option.

There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
*Binary*       *Description*
`mysql'        Compiled on native Windows, offering limited text editing
               capabilities.
`mysqlc'       Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries,
               which offers `readline' editing.

If you want to use `mysqlc', you must have a copy of the
`cygwinb19.dll' library installed somewhere that `mysqlc' can find it.
Current distributions of MySQL include this library in the same
directory as `mysqlc' (the `bin' directory under the base directory of
your MySQL installation). If your distribution does not have the
`cygwinb19.dll' library in the `bin' directory, look for it in the
`lib' directory and copy it to your Windows system directory
(`\Windows\system' or similar place).


MySQL on Windows Compared to MySQL on Unix
..........................................

MySQL for Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. The
Windows version of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding
Unix version, with the following exceptions:

*Windows 95 and threads*
     Windows 95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread
     creation.  Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you
     shouldn't run `mysqld' for an extended time on Windows 95 if your
     server handles many connections!  Other versions of Windows don't
     suffer from this bug.

*Concurrent reads*
     MySQL depends on the `pread()' and `pwrite()' calls to be able to
     mix `INSERT' and `SELECT'.  Currently we use mutexes to emulate
     `pread()'/`pwrite()'.  We will, in the long run, replace the file
     level interface with a virtual interface so that we can use the
     `readfile()'/`writefile()' interface on NT/2000/XP to get more
     speed.  The current implementation limits the number of open files
     MySQL can use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to
     run as many concurrent threads on NT/2000/XP as on Unix.

*Blocking read*
     MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection, which has the
     following implications:

        * A connection will not be disconnected automatically after 8
          hours, as happens with the Unix version of MySQL.

        * If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without
          killing MySQL.

        * `mysqladmin kill' will not work on a sleeping connection.

        * `mysqladmin shutdown' can't abort as long as there are
          sleeping connections.

     We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have
     figured out a nice workaround.

*`DROP DATABASE'*
     You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

*Killing MySQL from the task manager*
     You can't kill MySQL from the task manager or with the shutdown
     utility in Windows 95.  You must take it down with `mysqladmin
     shutdown'.

*Case-insensitive names*
     Filenames are not case sensitive on Windows, so MySQL database and
     table names are also not case sensitive on Windows.  The only
     restriction is that database and table names must be specified
     using the same case throughout a given statement.  *Note Name case
     sensitivity::.

*The `\' pathname separator character*
     Pathname components in Windows 95 are separated by the `\'
     character, which is also the escape character in MySQL.  If you
     are using `LOAD DATA INFILE' or `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE', use
     Unix style filenames with `/' characters:

          mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/tmp/skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
          mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;

     Alternatively, you must double the `\' character:

          mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE "C:\\tmp\\skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
          mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;

*Problems with pipes.*
     Pipes doesn't work reliably in the Windows command-line prompt.
     If the pipe includes the character `^Z' / `CHAR(24)', Windows will
     think it has encountered end-of-file and abort the program.

     This is mainly a problem when you try to apply a binary log as
     follows:

          mysqlbinlog binary-log-name | mysql --user=root

     If you get a problem applying the log and suspect it's because of
     an `^Z' / `CHAR(24)' character you can use the following
     workaround:

          mysqlbinlog binary-log-file --result-file=/tmp/bin.sql
          mysql --user=root --execute "source /tmp/bin.sql"

     The latter command also can be used to reliably read in any SQL
     file that may contain binary data.

*`Can't open named pipe' error*
     If you use a MySQL Version 3.22 server on NT with the newest MySQL
     client programs, you will get the following error:

          error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...

     This is because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT
     by default.  You can avoid this error by using the
     `--host=localhost' option to the new MySQL clients or create an
     option file `C:\my.cnf' that contains the following information:

          [client]
          host = localhost

     Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only if `mysqld-nt'
     or `mysqld-max-nt' is started with `--enable-named-pipe'.

*`Access denied for user' error*
     If you attempt to run a MySQL client program to connect to a server
     running on the same machine, but get the error `Access denied for
     user: 'some-user@unknown' to database 'mysql'', this means that
     MySQL can't resolve your hostname properly.

     To fix this, you should create a file `\windows\hosts' with the
     following information:

          127.0.0.1       localhost

*`ALTER TABLE'*
     While you are executing an `ALTER TABLE' statement, the table is
     locked from being used by other threads.  This has to do with the
     fact that on Windows, you can't delete a file that is in use by
     another threads.  In the future, we may find some way to work
     around this problem.

*`DROP TABLE'*
     `DROP TABLE' on a table that is in use by a `MERGE' table will not
     work on Windows because the `MERGE' handler does the table mapping
     hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't
     allow you to drop files that are open, you first must flush all
     `MERGE' tables (with `FLUSH TABLES') or drop the `MERGE' table
     before dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we
     introduce views.

*`DATA DIRECTORY' and `INDEX DIRECTORY'*
     The `DATA DIRECTORY' and `INDEX DIRECTORY' options for `CREATE
     TABLE' are ignored on Windows, because Windows doesn't support
     symbolic links.  These options also are ignored on systems that
     have a non-functional `realpath()' call.

Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us improve
MySQL on Windows:

   * Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

   * It would be really nice to be able to kill `mysqld' from the task
     manager.  For the moment, you must use `mysqladmin shutdown'.

   * Port `readline' to Windows for use in the `mysql' command-line
     tool.

   * GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (`mysql', `mysqlshow',
     `mysqladmin', and `mysqldump') would be nice.

   * It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in `net.c'
     were interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open
     threads with `mysqladmin kill' on Windows.

   * Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement
     methods provided by Windows.


Installing MySQL on Linux
-------------------------

The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using the RPM
packages. The MySQL RPMs are currently built on a SuSE Linux 7.3 system
but should work on most versions of Linux that support `rpm' and use
`glibc'.

If you have problems with an RPM file (for example, if you receive the
error "`Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up'"), see *Note
Binary notes-Linux::.

In most cases, you only need to install the `MySQL-server' and
`MySQL-client' packages to get a functional MySQL installation. The
other packages are not required for a standard installation.  If you
want to run a MySQL-Max server that has additional capabilities, you
should install the `MySQL-Max' RPM. However, you should do so only _
after_ installing the `MySQL-server' RPM.  *Note `mysqld-max':
mysqld-max.

If you get a dependency failure when trying to install the MySQL 4.0
packages (for example, "`error: removing these packages would break
dependencies: libmysqlclient.so.10 is needed by ...'"), you should also
install the package `MySQL-shared-compat', which includes both the
shared libraries for backward compatibility (`libmysqlclient.so.12' for
MySQL 4.0 and `libmysqlclient.so.10' for MySQL 3.23).

Many Linux distributions still ship with MySQL 3.23 and they usually
link applications dynamically to save disk space. If these shared
libraries are in a separate package (for example, `MySQL-shared'), it is
sufficient to simply leave this package installed and just upgrade the
MySQL server and client packages (which are statically linked and do
not depend on the shared libraries). For distributions that include the
shared libraries in the same package as the MySQL server (for example,
Red Hat Linux), you could either install our 3.23 `MySQL-shared' RPM,
or use the `MySQL-shared-compat' package instead.

The following RPM packages are available:

   * `MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
     connect to a MySQL server running on another machine. Please note:
     Server RPM files were called `MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm' before MySQL
     4.0.10. That is, they did not have `-server' in the name.

   * `MySQL-Max-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The MySQL-Max server. This server has additional capabilities that
     the one provided in the `MySQL-server' RPM does not.  You must
     install the `MySQL-server' RPM first, because the `MySQL-Max' RPM
     depends on it.

   * `MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
     install this package.

   * `MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and the `DBD::mysql' module.

   * `MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The libraries and include files that are needed if you want to
     compile other MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

   * `MySQL-shared-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     This package contains the shared libraries (`libmysqlclient.so*')
     that certain languages and applications need to dynamically load
     and use MySQL.

   * `MySQL-shared-compat-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     This package includes the shared libraries for both MySQL 3.23 and
     MySQL 4.0. Install this package instead of `MySQL-shared', if you
     have applications installed that are dynamically linked against
     MySQL 3.23 but you want to upgrade to MySQL 4.0 without breaking
     the library dependencies. This package is available since MySQL
     4.0.13.

   * `MySQL-embedded-VERSION.i386.rpm'

     The embedded MySQL server library (from MySQL 4.0).

   * `MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm'

     This contains the source code for all of the previous packages. It
     can also be used to rebuild the RPMs on other architectures (for
     example, Alpha or SPARC).

To see all files in an RPM package (for example, a `MySQL-server' RPM),
run:

     shell> rpm -qpl MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm

To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

     shell> rpm -i MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm
     shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm

To install just the client package, run:

     shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm

RPM provides a feature to verify the integrity and authenticity of
packages before installing them. If you would like to learn more about
this feature please see *Note Verifying Package Integrity::.

The server RPM places data under the `/var/lib/mysql' directory. The
RPM also creates the appropriate entries in `/etc/init.d/' to start the
server automatically at boot time. (This means that if you have
performed a previous installation and have made changes to its startup
script, you may want to make a copy of the script so you don't lose it
when you install a newer RPM.) See *Note Automatic start:: for more
information on how MySQL can be started automatically on system startup.

If you want to install the MySQL RPM on older Linux distributions that
do not support initialization scripts in `/etc/init.d' (directly or via
a symlink), you should create a symbolic link that points to the
location where your initialization scripts actually are installed. For
example, if that location is `/etc/rc.d/init.d', use these commands
before installing the RPM to create `/etc/init.d' as a symbolic link
that points there:

     shell> cd /etc; ln -s rc.d/init.d .

However, all current major Linux distributions should already support
the new directory layout that uses `/etc/init.d', because it is
required for LSB (Linux Standard Base) compliance.

If the RPM files that you install include `MySQL-server', the `mysqld'
server should be up and running after installation.  You should now be
able to start using MySQL.  *Note Post-installation::.

If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary
installation chapter. *Note Installing binary::.


Installing MySQL on Mac OS X
----------------------------

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.11, you can install MySQL on Mac OS X 10.2
("Jaguar") using a Mac OS X binary package in `PKG' format instead of
the binary tarball distribution. Please note that older versions of Mac
OS X (for example, 10.1.x) are not supported by this package.

The package is located inside a disk image (`.dmg') file, that you
first need to mount by double-clicking its icon in the Finder. It should
then mount the image and display its contents.

*NOTE*: Before proceeding with the installation, be sure to shut down
all running MySQL server instances by either using the MySQL Manager
Application (on Mac OS X Server) or via `mysqladmin shutdown' on the
command line.

To actually install the MySQL PKG file, double click on the package
icon. This launches the Mac OS X Package Installer, which will guide
you through the installation of MySQL.

Due to a bug in the Mac OS X package installer, you may sometimes see
the error message `You cannot install this software on this disk.
(null)' in the destination disk selection dialogue. If this error
occurs, simply click the `Go Back' button once to return to the
previous screen. Then click `Continue' to advance to the destination
disk selection again, and you should be able to choose the destination
disk correctly. We have reported this bug to Apple and they are
investigating this problem.

The Mac OS X PKG of MySQL will install itself into
`/usr/local/mysql-<version>' and will also install a symbolic link
`/usr/local/mysql', pointing to the new location. If a directory named
`/usr/local/mysql' already exists, it will be renamed to
`/usr/local/mysql.bak' first. Additionally, it will install the grant
tables in the `mysql' database by executing `mysql_install_db' after
the installation.

The installation layout is similar to the one of the binary
distribution; all MySQL binaries are located in the directory
`/usr/local/mysql/bin'.  The MySQL socket file is created as
`/tmp/mysql.sock' by default.  *Note Installation layouts::.

MySQL installation requires a Mac OS X user account named `mysql' (a
user account with this name should exist by default on Mac OS X 10.2
and up).

If you are running Mac OS X Server, you already have a version of MySQL
installed.  The versions of MySQL that ship with Mac OS X Server
versions are shown in the following table:

*Mac OS X Server       *MySQL Version*
Version*               
10.2-10.2.2            3.23.51
10.2.3-10.2.6          3.23.53
10.3                   4.0.14
10.3.2                 4.0.16

This manual section covers the installation of the official MySQL Mac
OS X PKG only.  Make sure to read Apple's help about installing MySQL
(Run the "Help View" application, select "Mac OS X Server" help, and do
a search for "MySQL" and read the item entitled "Installing MySQL").

Especially note that for pre-installed versions of MySQL on Mac OS X
Server, you should start `mysqld' with `safe_mysqld' instead of
`mysqld_safe' if the MySQL is older than version 4.0.

If you previously used Marc Liyanage's MySQL packages for Mac OS X from
`http://www.entropy.ch', you can simply follow the update instructions
for packages using the binary installation layout as given on his pages.

If you are upgrading from Marc's 3.23.xx versions or from the Mac OS X
Server version of MySQL to the official MySQL PKG, you also need to
convert the existing MySQL privilege tables to the current format,
because some new security privileges have been added.  *Note
Upgrading-grant-tables::.

If you would like to automatically start up MySQL during system bootup,
you also need to install the MySQL Startup Item. Starting with MySQL
4.0.15, it is part of the Mac OS X installation disk images as a
separate installation package. Simply double-click the
`MySQLStartupItem.pkg' icon and follow the instructions to install it.

Note that the Startup Item need be installed only once! There is no
need to install it each time you upgrade the MySQL package later.

The Startup Item will be installed into `/Library/StartupItems/MySQL'.
It adds a variable `MYSQLCOM=-YES-' to the system configuration file
`/etc/hostconfig'. If you would like to disable the automatic startup
of MySQL, simply change this variable to `MYSQLCOM=-NO-'.

On Mac OS X Server, the default MySQL installation uses the variable
`MYSQL' in `/etc/hostconfig'.  The MySQL AB Startup Item installer
disables this variable by setting it to `MYSQL=-NO-'. This avoids boot
time conflicts with the `MYSQLCOM' variable used by the MySQL AB
Startup Item.  However, it does not shut down an already running MySQL
server.

After the installation, you can start up MySQL by running the following
commands in a terminal window. Please note that you must have
administrator privileges to perform this task.

If you have installed the Startup Item:

     shell> sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQL/MySQL start
     (Enter your password, if necessary)
     (Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)

If you don't use the Startup Item, enter the following command sequence:

     shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
     shell> sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
     (Enter your password, if necessary)
     (Press Control-Z)
     shell> bg
     (Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)

You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server, for example, by
running `/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql'.

If you are installing MySQL for the first time, *please remember to set
a password for the MySQL `root' user!*

This is done with the following two commands:

     /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password <password>
     /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h `hostname` password <password>

Please make sure that the `hostname' command in the second line is
enclosed by *backtick* characters (``'), so the shell can replace it
with the output of the command (which is the hostname of your system)!

You might want to also add aliases to your shell's resource file to
access `mysql' and `mysqladmin' from the command line. The syntax for
`tcsh' is:

     alias mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
     alias mysqladmin /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin

For `bash', use:

     alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
     alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin

Even better, add `/usr/local/mysql/bin' to your `PATH' environment
variable. For example, add the following line to your `$HOME/.tcshrc'
file if your shell is `tcsh':

     setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin

If no `.tcshrc' file exists in your home directory, create it with a
text editor.

If you are upgrading an existing installation, please note that
installing a new MySQL PKG does not remove the directory of an older
installation. Unfortunately, the Mac OS X Installer does not yet offer
the functionality required to properly upgrade previously installed
packages.

To use your existing databases with the new installation, you'll need
to copy the contents of the old data directory to the new data
directory. Make sure neither the old server nor the new one is running
when you do this.  After you have copied over the MySQL database files
from the previous installation and have successfully started the new
server, you should consider removing the old installation files to save
disk space.  Additionally, you should also remove older versions of the
Package Receipt directories located in
`/Library/Receipts/mysql-<version>.pkg'.


Installing MySQL on NetWare
---------------------------

Porting `MySQL' to `NetWare' was an effort spearheaded by `Novell'.
Novell customers will be pleased to note that NetWare 6.5 will ship
with bundled MySQL binaries, complete with an automatic commercial use
license for all servers running that version of NetWare.

As of version 4.0.11, the MySQL server is available for Novell NetWare
in binary package form.  MySQL for NetWare is compiled using a
combination of `Metrowerks CodeWarrior for NetWare' and special
cross-compilation versions of the GNU autotools.

In order to host MySQL, the NetWare server must meet these requirements:

   * NetWare version 6.5, or NetWare 6.0 with Support Pack 3 installed
     (You can obtain this at
     `http://support.novell.com/filefinder/13659/index.html').  The
     system must meet Novell's minimum requirements to run the
     respective version of NetWare.

   * MySQL data, as well as the binaries themselves, must be installed
     on an NSS volume; traditional volumes are not supported.

The binary package for NetWare can be obtained at
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/'.

To install MySQL for NetWare, use the following procedure:

  1. If you are upgrading from a prior installation, stop the MySQL
     server.  This is done from the server console, using the following
     command:

          SERVER:  mysqladmin -u root shutdown

  2. Log on to the target server from a client machine with access to
     the location where you will install MySQL.

  3. Extract the binary package zip file onto the server. Be sure to
     allow the paths in the zip file to be used. It is safe to simply
     extract the file to `SYS:\'.

     If you are upgrading from a prior installation, you may need to
     copy the data directory (for example, `SYS:MYSQL\DATA') now, as
     well as `my.cnf' if you have customized it. You can then delete
     the old copy of MySQL.

  4. You may wish to rename the directory to something more consistent
     and easy to use. We recommend using `SYS:MYSQL'; examples in the
     manual will use this to refer to the installation directory in
     general.

  5. At the server console, add a search path for the directory
     containing the MySQL NLMs. For example:

          SERVER:  SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN

  6. Install the initial database, if needed, by executing
     `mysql_install_db' at the server console.

  7. Start the MySQL server using `mysqld_safe' at the server console.

  8. To finish the installation, you should also add the following
     commands to `autoexec.ncf'. For example, if your MySQL
     installation is in `SYS:MYSQL' and you want MySQL to start
     automatically, you could add these lines:

          #Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
          SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
          MYSQLD_SAFE

     If you are running MySQL on NetWare 6.0, we strongly suggest that
     you use the `--skip-external-locking' option on the command line:

          #Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
          SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
          MYSQLD_SAFE --skip-external-locking

     It will also be neccesary to use `CHECK TABLE' and `REPAIR TABLE'
     instead of `myisamchk', because `myisamchk' makes use of external
     locking.  External locking is known to have problems on NetWare
     6.0; the problem has been eliminated in NetWare 6.5.


If there was an existing installation of MySQL on the server, be sure
to check for existing MySQL startup commands in `autoexec.ncf', and
edit or delete them as necessary.


Installing MySQL on HP-UX
-------------------------

Binary distributions of MySQL for HP-UX are distributed as HP depot
files or as `tar' files.  To use the depot file you must be running at
least HP-UX 10.x to have access to HP's software depot tools.  To
install the HP-UX `tar.gz' distribution, you must have a copy of GNU
`tar'.

The HP version of MySQL was compiled on an HP 9000/8xx server under
HP-UX 10.20, and uses MIT-pthreads.  It is known to work well under
this configuration.  MySQL Version 3.22.26 and newer can also be built
with HP's native thread package.

Other configurations that may work:

   * HP 9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20+

   * HP 9000/8xx running HP-UX 10.30

The following configurations almost definitely won't work:

   * HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 10.x where x < 2

   * HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 9.x

To install the distribution, use one of the commands here, where
`/path/to/depot' is the full pathname of the depot file:

   * To install everything, including the server, client and
     development tools:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.full

   * To install only the server:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.server

   * To install only the client package:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.client

   * To install only the development tools:

          shell> /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.developer

The depot places binaries and libraries in `/opt/mysql' and data in
`/var/opt/mysql'. The depot also creates the appropriate entries in
`/etc/init.d' and `/etc/rc2.d' to start the server automatically at
boot time.  Obviously, this entails being `root' to install.


Installing MySQL on Other Unix-like Systems
-------------------------------------------

This section covers the installation of MySQL binary distributions that
are provided for various platforms in the form of `tar' files (files
with a `.tar.gz' extension).  See *Note MySQL binaries:: for a detailed
list.

In addition to these generic packages, we also offer binaries in
platform-specific package formats for selected platforms.  See *Note
Quick Standard Installation:: for more information on how to install
these.

You need the following tools to install a MySQL `tar' file binary
distribution:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution. GNU `tar' is known
     to work. Some operating systems come with a pre-installed version
     of `tar' that is known to have problems.  For example, Sun `tar'
     and Mac OS X `tar' are known to have problems with long filenames.
     In such cases, you should install GNU `tar' first.  On Mac OS X,
     you can use the pre-installed `gnutar' program.

If you run into problems, *please always use `mysqlbug'* when posting
questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem isn't a bug,
`mysqlbug' gathers system information that will help others solve your
problem.  By not using `mysqlbug', you lessen the likelihood of getting
a solution to your problem.  You will find `mysqlbug' in the `bin'
directory after you unpack the distribution.  *Note Bug reports::.

The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL binary
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> cd /usr/local
     shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
     shell> cd mysql
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  .
     shell> chown -R mysql data
     shell> chgrp -R mysql .
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld' for
`bin/mysqld_safe' in the final command.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a binary distribution, follow these steps, then proceed to
*Note Post-installation::, for post-installation setup and testing:

  1. Add a user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group and the `mysql' user.  The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix.  They may also be called `adduser' and
     `addgroup'.  You may wish to call the user and group something
     else instead of `mysql'.

  2. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it. In the following example, we
     unpack the distribution under `/usr/local' (The following
     instructions, therefore, assume you have permission to create
     files and directories in `/usr/local'.  If that directory is
     protected, you will need to perform the installation as `root'.)

  3. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

     MySQL `tar' file binary distributions have names like
     `mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz', where `VERSION' is a number (for
     example, `4.0.17'), and `OS' indicates the type of operating
     system for which the distribution is intended (for example,
     `pc-linux-gnu-i586').  For a given release, binary distributions
     for all platforms are built from the same MySQL source
     distribution.

  4. Change into the intended installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local

  5. Unpack the distribution, which will create the installation
     directory.  Then create a symbolic link to that directory:

          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
          shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql

     The `tar' command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION-OS'.
     The `ln' command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This
     lets you refer more easily to the installation directory as
     `/usr/local/mysql'.

     With GNU `tar', no separate invocation of `gunzip' is necessary.
     You can replace the first line with the following alternative
     command to uncompress and extract the distribution:

          shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz

  6. Change into the installation directory:

          shell> cd mysql

     You will find several files and subdirectories in the `mysql'
     directory.  The most important for installation purposes are the
     `bin' and `scripts' subdirectories.

    `bin'
          This directory contains client programs and the server.  You
          should add the full pathname of this directory to your `PATH'
          environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
          programs properly. *Note Environment variables::.

    `scripts'
          This directory contains the `mysql_install_db' script used to
          initialize the `mysql' database containing the grant tables
          that store the server access permissions.

  7. If you haven't installed MySQL before, you must create the MySQL
     grant tables:

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Note that for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
     `mysql_install_db' left the server running after creating the grant
     tables.  This is no longer true; you will need to restart the
     server after performing the remaining steps in this procedure.

  8. Change ownership of program binaries to `root' and ownership of
     the data directory to the user that you will run `mysqld' as.
     Assuming that you are located in the installation directory
     (`/usr/local/mysql'), the commands look like this:

          shell> chown -R root  .
          shell> chown -R mysql data
          shell> chgrp -R mysql .

     The first command changes the `owner' attribute of the files to the
     `root' user. The second changes the `owner' attribute of the data
     directory to the `mysql' user. The third changes the `group'
     attribute to the `mysql' group.

  9. If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files.  More information can be
     found in the `support-files/mysql.server' script itself and in
     *Note Automatic start::.

 10. You can set up new accounts using the `bin/mysql_setpermission'
     script if you install the `DBI' and `DBD::mysql' Perl modules.
     For instructions, see *Note Perl support::.

 11. If you would like to use `mysqlaccess' and have the MySQL
     distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the
     location where `mysqlaccess' expects to find the `mysql' client.
     Edit the `bin/mysqlaccess' script at approximately line 18.
     Search for a line that looks like this:

          $MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable

     Change the path to reflect the location where `mysql' actually is
     stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a
     `Broken pipe' error when you run `mysqlaccess'.


After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should test your
distribution.

You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld' for
`bin/mysqld_safe' in the command.

Now proceed to *Note `mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe, and *Note
Post-installation::.


MySQL Installation Using a Source Distribution
==============================================

Before you proceed with the source installation, check first to see
whether our binary is available for your platform and whether it will
work for you. We put a lot of effort into making sure that our binaries
are built with the best possible options.

You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution. GNU `tar' is known
     to work. Some `tar' implementations that come pre-installed with
     the operating system (for example, Sun `tar') is known to have
     problems with long file names). In that case, you should install
     GNU `tar' first.

   * A working ANSI C++ compiler.  `gcc' 2.95.2 or later, `egcs' 1.0.2
     or later or `egcs 2.91.66', SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
     compilers that are known to work.  `libg++' is not needed when
     using `gcc'.  `gcc' 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible to
     compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as `sql/sql_base.cc'.
     If you only have `gcc' 2.7.x, you must upgrade your `gcc' to be
     able to compile MySQL. `gcc' 2.8.1 is also known to have problems
     on some platforms, so it should be avoided if a new compiler
     exists for the platform.

     `gcc' 2.95.2 or later is recommended when compiling MySQL Version
     3.23.x.

   * A good `make' program.  GNU `make' is always recommended and is
     sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
     `make' 3.75 or newer.

If you are using a recent version of `gcc', recent enough to understand
the `-fno-exceptions' option, it is *very important* that you use it.
Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use `-felide-constructors' and `-fno-rtti' along
with `-fno-exceptions'. When in doubt, do the following:


     CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
            -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
            --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
            --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

On most systems this will give you a fast and stable binary.

If you run into problems, *please always use `mysqlbug'* when posting
questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem isn't a bug,
`mysqlbug' gathers system information that will help others solve your
problem.  By not using `mysqlbug', you lessen the likelihood of getting
a solution to your problem.  You will find `mysqlbug' in the `scripts'
directory after you unpack the distribution.  *Note Bug reports::.

Quick Source Installation Overview
----------------------------------

The basic commands you must execute to install a MySQL source
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
     shell> cd mysql-VERSION
     shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
     shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
     shell> bin/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  .
     shell> chown -R mysql var
     shell> chgrp -R mysql .
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld' for
`bin/mysqld_safe' in the final command.

If you start from a source RPM, do the following:

     shell> rpm --rebuild --clean MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm

This will make a binary RPM that you can install.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a source distribution, follow these steps, then proceed to
*Note Post-installation::, for post-installation initialization and
testing:

  1. Add a user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group and the `mysql' user.  The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix.  They may also be called `adduser' and
     `addgroup'.  You may wish to call the user and group something
     else instead of `mysql'.

  2. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it.

  3. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.  MySQL source distributions are
     provided as compressed `tar' archives and have names like
     `mysql-VERSION.tar.gz', where `VERSION' is a number like
     `4.0.18'.

  4. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -

     This command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION'.

     With GNU `tar', no separate invocation of `gunzip' is necessary.
     You can use the following alternative command to uncompress and
     extract the distribution:

          shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz

  5. Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

          shell> cd mysql-VERSION

     Note that currently you must configure and build MySQL from this
     top-level directory.  You cannot build it in a different directory.

  6. Configure the release and compile everything:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> make

     When you run `configure', you might want to specify some options.
     Run `./configure --help' for a list of options.  *Note `configure'
     options: configure options, discusses some of the more useful
     options.

     If `configure' fails and you are going to send mail to a MySQL
     mailing list to ask for assistance, please include any lines from
     `config.log' that you think can help solve the problem.  Also
     include the last couple of lines of output from `configure'.  Post
     the bug report using the `mysqlbug' script.  *Note Bug reports::.

     If the compile fails, see *Note Compilation problems::, for help
     with a number of common problems.

  7. Install the distribution:

          shell> make install

     If you want to set up an option file, use one of those present in
     the `support-files' directory as template. For example:

          shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf

     You might need to run these commands as `root'.

     If you want to configure support for `InnoDB' tables, you should
     edit the `/etc/my.cnf' file, remove the `#' character before the
     option lines that start with `innodb_...', and modify the option
     values to be what you want.  *Note Option files::, and *Note
     InnoDB start::.

  8. Change location into the installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local/mysql

  9. If you haven't installed MySQL before, you must create the MySQL
     grant tables:

          shell> bin/mysql_install_db

     Note that for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
     `mysql_install_db' left the server running after creating the grant
     tables.  This is no longer true; you will need to restart the
     server after performing the remaining steps in this procedure.

 10. Change ownership of binaries to `root' and ownership of the data
     directory to the user that you will run `mysqld' as.  Assuming
     that you are located in the installation directory
     (`/usr/local/mysql'), the commands look like this:

          shell> chown -R root  .
          shell> chown -R mysql var
          shell> chgrp -R mysql .

     The first command changes the `owner' attribute of the files to the
     `root' user. The second changes the `owner' attribute of the data
     directory to the `mysql' user. The third changes the `group'
     attribute to the `mysql' group.

 11. If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files.  More information can be
     found in the `support-files/mysql.server' script itself and in
     *Note Automatic start::.

 12. You can set up new accounts using the `bin/mysql_setpermission'
     script if you install the `DBI' and `DBD::mysql' Perl modules.
     For instructions, see *Note Perl support::.


After everything has been installed, you should initialize and test your
distribution using this command:

     shell> /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld' for
`bin/mysqld_safe' in the command.

If that command fails immediately and prints `mysqld ended', you can
find some information in the file `mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'.
The likely reason is that you already have another `mysqld' server
running.  *Note Multiple servers::.

Now proceed to *Note Post-installation::.


Typical `configure' Options
---------------------------

The `configure' script gives you a great deal of control over how you
configure a MySQL source distribution.  Typically you do this using
options on the `configure' command-line.  You can also affect
`configure' using certain environment variables.  *Note Environment
variables::.  For a list of options supported by `configure', run this
command:

     shell> ./configure --help

Some of the more commonly used `configure' options are described here:

   * To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
     not the server, use the `--without-server' option:

          shell> ./configure --without-server

     If you don't have a C++ compiler, `mysql' will not compile (it is
     the one client program that requires C++).  In this case, you can
     remove the code in `configure' that tests for the C++ compiler and
     then run `./configure' with the `--without-server' option. The
     compile step will still try to build `mysql', but you can ignore
     any warnings about `mysql.cc'.  (If `make' stops, try `make -k' to
     tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors
     occur.)

   * If you want to get an embedded MySQL library (`libmysqld.a') you
     should use the `--with-embedded-server' option.

   * If you don't want your log files and database directories located
     under `/usr/local/var', use a `configure' command, something like
     one of these:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                     --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data

     The first command changes the installation prefix so that
     everything is installed under `/usr/local/mysql' rather than the
     default of `/usr/local'.  The second command preserves the default
     installation prefix, but overrides the default location for
     database directories (normally `/usr/local/var') and changes it to
     `/usr/local/mysql/data'.  After you have compiled MySQL, you can
     change these options with option files. *Note Option files::.

   * If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located
     somewhere other than the default location (normally in the
     directory `/tmp' or `/var/run') use a `configure' command like
     this:

          shell> ./configure \
                     --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock

     Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname.  You can
     also later change the location of `mysql.sock' by using a MySQL
     option file. *Note Problems with `mysql.sock': Problems with
     mysql.sock.

   * If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to
     make a binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around
     problems with some Red Hat Linux distributions), run `configure'
     like this:

          shell> ./configure --with-client-ldflags=-all-static \
                     --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

   * If you are using `gcc' and don't have `libg++' or `libstdc++'
     installed, you can tell `configure' to use `gcc' as your C++
     compiler:

          shell> CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure

     When you use `gcc' as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to
     link in `libg++' or `libstdc++'.  This may be a good idea to do
     even if you have the above libraries installed, as some versions
     of these libraries have caused strange problems for MySQL users in
     the past.

     The following list indicates some compilers and environment
     variable settings that are commonly used with each one.



    `gcc' 2.7.2:
          `CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors"'

    `egcs' 1.0.3a:
          `CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
          -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"'

    `gcc' 2.95.2:
          `CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro
          \ -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"'

    `pgcc' 2.90.29 or newer:
          `CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double" CXX=gcc \
          CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double \
          -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"'

     In most cases you can get a reasonably optimal MySQL binary by
     using the options from the preceding list and adding the following
     options to the `configure' line:

          --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
          --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The full `configure' line would, in other words, be something like
     the following for all recent `gcc' versions:

          CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
          -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
          --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
          --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The binaries we provide on the MySQL web site at
     `http://www.mysql.com/' are all compiled with full optimization and
     should be perfect for most users.  *Note MySQL binaries::.  There
     are some configuration setings you can tweak to make an even
     faster binary, but this is only for advanced users.  *Note Compile
     and link options::.

     If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or
     linker not being able to create the shared library
     `libmysqlclient.so.#' (`#' is a version number), you can work
     around this problem by giving the `--disable-shared' option to
     `configure'.  In this case, `configure' will not build a shared
     `libmysqlclient.so.#' library.

   * You can configure MySQL not to use `DEFAULT' column values for
     non-`NULL' columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be
     `NULL'). *Note constraint NOT NULL::.

          shell> CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS ./configure

     The effect of this flag is to cause any `INSERT' statement to fail
     unless it provides explicit values for all columns that require a
     non-`NULL' value.

   * By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
     change the default set, use the `--with-charset' option:
          shell> ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
     `CHARSET' may be one of `big5', `cp1251', `cp1257', `czech',
     `danish', `dec8', `dos', `euc_kr', `gb2312', `gbk', `german1',
     `hebrew', `hp8', `hungarian', `koi8_ru', `koi8_ukr', `latin1',
     `latin2', `sjis', `swe7', `tis620', `ujis', `usa7', or
     `win1251ukr'.  *Note Character sets::.

     If you want to convert characters between the server and the
     client, you should take a look at the `SET CHARACTER SET' command.
     *Note `SET': SET OPTION.

     *Warning:* If you change character sets after having created any
     tables, you will have to run `myisamchk -r -q
     --set-character-set=charset' on every table. Your indexes may be
     sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if you install
     MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure MySQL to use a
     different character set and reinstall it.)

     With the `configure' option `--with-extra-charsets=LIST', you can
     define which additional character sets should be compiled into the
     server.  `LIST' is either a list of character sets separated with
     spaces, `complex' to include all characters that can't be
     dynamically loaded, or `all' to include all character sets into
     the binaries.

   * To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the `--with-debug'
     option:
          shell> ./configure --with-debug
     This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find
     some errors and that provides output about what is happening.
     *Note Debugging server::.

   * If your client programs are using threads, you also must compile a
     thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
     `--enable-thread-safe-client' configure options. This will create a
     `libmysqlclient_r' library with which you should link your threaded
     applications.  *Note Threaded clients::.

   * Options that pertain to particular systems can be found in the
     system-specific section of this manual.  *Note Operating System
     Specific Notes::.


Installing from the Development Source Tree
-------------------------------------------

*Caution*: You should read this section only if you are interested in
helping us test our new code. If you just want to get MySQL up and
running on your system, you should use a standard release distribution
(either a binary or source distribution will do).

To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these
instructions:

  1. Download `BitKeeper' from
     `http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi'.  You will need
     `Bitkeeper' 3.0 or newer to access our repository.

  2. Follow the instructions to install it.

  3. After `BitKeeper' is installed, first go to the directory you want
     to work from, and then use one of the following commands to clone
     the MySQL version branch of your choice:

     To clone the old 3.23 branch, use this command:

          shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-3.23 mysql-3.23

     To clone the 4.0 stable (production) branch, use this command:

          shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.0 mysql-4.0

     To clone the 4.1 alpha branch, use this command:

          shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1

     To clone the 5.0 development branch, use this command:

          shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-5.0 mysql-5.0

     In the preceding examples the source tree will be set up in the
     `mysql-3.23/', `mysql-4.0/', `mysql-4.1/', or `mysql-5.0/'
     subdirectory of your current directory.

     If you are behind a firewall and can only initiate HTTP
     connections, you can also use `BitKeeper' via HTTP.

     If you are required to use a proxy server, set the environment
     variable `http_proxy' to point to your proxy:

          shell> export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/"

     Now, simply replace the `bk://' with `http://' when doing a clone.
     Example:

          shell> bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1

     The initial download of the source tree may take a while,
     depending on the speed of your connection--please be patient.

  4. You will need GNU `make', `autoconf' 2.53 (or newer), `automake'
     1.5, `libtool' 1.4, and `m4' to run the next set of commands. Even
     though many operating systems already come with their own
     implementation of `make', chances are high that the compilation
     will fail with strange error messages. Therefore, it is highly
     recommended that you use GNU `make' (sometimes named `gmake')
     instead.

     Fortunately, a large number of operating systems already ship with
     the GNU toolchain preinstalled or supply installable packages of
     these. In any case, they can also be downloaded from the following
     locations:

        * <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>

        * <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>

        * <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>

        * <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>

     If you are trying to configure MySQL 4.1 or later, you will also
     need GNU `bison' 1.75 or later.  Older versions of `bison' may
     report this error:

          sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767) exceeded

     Note: The maximum table size is not actually exceeded, the error
     is caused by bugs in older versions of `bison'.

     Versions of MySQL before version 4.1 may also compile with other
     `yacc' implementations (for example, BSD `yacc' 91.7.30). For later
     versions, GNU `bison' is required.

     The following example shows the typical commands required to
     configure a source tree. The first `cd' command changes location
     into the top-level directory of the tree; replace `mysql-4.0' with
     the appropriate directory name.

          shell> cd mysql-4.0
          shell> bk -r edit
          shell> aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake
          shell> (cd innobase; aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake)
          shell> (cd bdb/dist; sh s_all)
          shell> ./configure  # Add your favorite options here
          make

     The command lines that change directory into the `innobase' and
     `bdb/dist' directories are used to configure the `InnoDB' and
     Berkeley DB (`BDB') storage engines.  You can omit these command
     lines if you to not require `InnoDB' or `BDB' support.

     If you get some strange error during this stage, check that you
     really have `libtool' installed.

     A collection of our standard configuration scripts is located in
     the `BUILD/' subdirectory.  You may find it more convenient to use
     the `BUILD/compile-pentium-debug' script than the preceding set of
     shell commands.. To compile on a different architecture, modify
     the script by removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

  5. When the build is done, run `make install'.  Be careful with this
     on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live
     release installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL,
     we recommend that you run `./configure' with different values for
     the `--prefix', `--with-tcp-port', and `--unix-socket-path' options
     than those used for your production server.

  6. Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new
     features crash.  Start by running `make test'.  *Note MySQL test
     suite::.

  7. If you have gotten to the `make' stage and the distribution does
     not compile, please report it in our bugs database at
     `http://bugs.mysql.com/'.  If you have installed the latest
     versions of the required GNU tools, and they crash trying to
     process our configuration files, please report that also.
     However, if you execute `aclocal' and get a `command not found'
     error or a similar problem, do not report it.  Instead, make sure
     all the necessary tools are installed and that your `PATH'
     variable is set correctly so that your shell can find them.

  8. After the initial `bk clone' operation to obtain the source tree,
     you should run `bk pull' periodically to get updates.

  9. You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs
     by using `bk revtool'.  If you see some funny diffs or code that
     you have a question about, do not hesitate to send email to the
     MySQL internals mailing list.  *Note Mailing-list::.  Also, if you
     think you have a better idea on how to do something, send an email
     message to the same address with a patch.  `bk diffs' will produce
     a patch for you after you have made changes to the source. If you
     do not have the time to code your idea, just send a description.

 10. `BitKeeper' has a nice help utility that you can access via `bk
     helptool'.

 11. Please note that any commits (`bk ci' or `bk citool') will trigger
     the posting of a message with the changeset to our internals
     mailing list, as well as the usual openlogging.org submission with
     just the changeset comments.  Generally, you wouldn't need to use
     commit (since the public tree will not allow `bk push'), but
     rather use the `bk diffs' method described previously.


You can also browse changesets, comments, and source code online. For
example, to browse this information for MySQL 4.1, go to
`http://mysql.bkbits.net:8080/mysql-4.1'.

The manual is in a separate tree which can be cloned with:

     shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysqldoc mysqldoc

There are also public BitKeeper trees for MySQL Control Center and
Connector/ODBC. They can be cloned respectively as follows.

To clone MySQL Control center, use this command:

     shell> bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/mysqlcc mysqlcc

To clone Connector/ODBC, use this command:

     shell> bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/myodbc3 myodbc3


Dealing With Problems Compiling MySQL
-------------------------------------

All MySQL programs compile cleanly for us with no warnings on Solaris
or Linux using `gcc'.  On other systems, warnings may occur due to
differences in system include files.  See *Note MIT-pthreads:: for
warnings that may occur when using MIT-pthreads.  For other problems,
check the following list.

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring.  If you do need to
reconfigure, take note of the following:

   * If `configure' is run after it already has been run, it may use
     information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This
     information is stored in `config.cache'.  When `configure' starts
     up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on
     the assumption that the information is still correct.  That
     assumption is invalid when you reconfigure.

   * Each time you run `configure', you must run `make' again to
     recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from
     previous builds first because they were compiled using different
     configuration options.

To prevent old configuration information or object files from being
used, run these commands before re-running `configure':

     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> make clean

Alternatively, you can run `make distclean'.

The following list describes some of the problems when compiling MySQL
that have been found to occur most often:

   * If you get errors when compiling `sql_yacc.cc', such as the ones
     shown here, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:

          Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
     or:
          Out of virtual memory
     or:
          Virtual memory exhausted

     The problem is that `gcc' requires huge amounts of memory to
     compile `sql_yacc.cc' with inline functions.  Try running
     `configure' with the `--with-low-memory' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-low-memory

     This option causes `-fno-inline' to be added to the compile line
     if you are using `gcc' and `-O0' if you are using something else.
     You should try the `--with-low-memory' option even if you have so
     much memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have
     run out.  This problem has been observed to occur even on systems
     with generous hardware configurations, and the `--with-low-memory'
     option usually fixes it.

   * By default, `configure' picks `c++' as the compiler name and GNU
     `c++' links with `-lg++'.  If you are using `gcc', that behavior
     can cause problems during configuration such as this:

          configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
          C++ compiler cannot create executables.

     You might also observe problems during compilation related to
     `g++', `libg++', or `libstdc++'.

     One cause of these problems is that you may not have `g++', or you
     may have `g++' but not `libg++', or `libstdc++'.  Take a look at
     the `config.log' file.  It should contain the exact reason why
     your C++ compiler didn't work.  To work around these problems, you
     can use `gcc' as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment
     variable `CXX' to `"gcc -O3"'.  For example:

          shell> CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure

     This works because `gcc' compiles C++ sources as well as `g++'
     does, but does not link in `libg++' or `libstdc++' by default.

     Another way to fix these problems is to install `g++', `libg++',
     and `libstdc++'.  We would however like to recommend you to not
     use `libg++' or `libstdc++' with MySQL as this will only increase
     the binary size of mysqld without giving you any benefits.  Some
     versions of these libraries have also caused strange problems for
     MySQL users in the past.

     Using `gcc' as the C++ compiler is also required, if you want to
     compile MySQL with RAID functionality (see *Note CREATE TABLE::
     for more info on RAID table type) and you are using GNU `gcc'
     version 3 and above. If you get errors like the ones below during
     the linking stage when you configure MySQL to compile with the
     option `--with-raid', try to use `gcc' as your C++ compiler by
     defining the above mentioned environment variable `CXX':

          gcc -O3 -DDBUG_OFF -rdynamic -o isamchk isamchk.o sort.o  libnisam.a
          ../mysys/libmysys.a ../dbug/libdbug.a ../strings/libmystrings.a
           -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x79): In function
          `my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0xdd): In function
          `my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x129): In function
          `my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x189): In function
          `my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x64b): In function
          `my_raid_close':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

   * If your compile fails with errors, such as any of the following,
     you must upgrade your version of `make' to GNU `make':

          making all in mit-pthreads
          make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
          Badly formed macro assignment
     or:
          make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:
     or:
          pthread.h: No such file or directory

     Solaris and FreeBSD are known to have troublesome `make' programs.

     GNU `make' Version 3.75 is known to work.

   * If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers,
     do so by adding the flags to the `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS'
     environment variables.  You can also specify the compiler names
     this way using `CC' and `CXX'.  For example:

          shell> CC=gcc
          shell> CFLAGS=-O3
          shell> CXX=gcc
          shell> CXXFLAGS=-O3
          shell> export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS

     See *Note MySQL binaries::, for a list of flag definitions that
     have been found to be useful on various systems.

   * If you get an error message like this, you need to upgrade your
     `gcc' compiler:

          client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'

     `gcc' 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using `gcc' 2.95.2
     or `egcs' 1.0.3a instead.

   * If you get errors such as those shown here when compiling `mysqld',
     `configure' didn't correctly detect the type of the last argument
     to `accept()', `getsockname()', or `getpeername()':

          cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
               type of the pointer value ''length'' is ''unsigned long'',
               which is not compatible with ''int''.
          new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&cAddr, &length);

     To fix this, edit the `config.h' file (which is generated by
     `configure').  Look for these lines:

          /* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
          #define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX

     Change `XXX' to `size_t' or `int', depending on your operating
     system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
     `configure' because `configure' regenerates `config.h'.)

   * The `sql_yacc.cc' file is generated from `sql_yacc.yy'.  Normally
     the build process doesn't need to create `sql_yacc.cc', because
     MySQL comes with an already generated copy.  However, if you do
     need to re-create it, you might encounter this error:

          "sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...

     This is a sign that your version of `yacc' is deficient.  You
     probably need to install `bison' (the GNU version of `yacc') and
     use that instead.

   * On Debian Linux 3.0, you need to install `gawk' instead of the
     default `mawk', if you want to compile MySQL 4.1 or higher with
     Berkeley DB support.

   * If you need to debug `mysqld' or a MySQL client, run `configure'
     with the `--with-debug' option, then recompile and link your
     clients with the new client library.  *Note Debugging client::.

   * If you get a compilation error on Linux (e.g. SuSE Linux 8.1 or
     Red Hat Linux 7.3) similar to the following one:

          libmysql.c:1329: warning: passing arg 5 of `gethostbyname_r' from
          incompatible pointer type
          libmysql.c:1329: too few arguments to function `gethostbyname_r'
          libmysql.c:1329: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer
          without a cast
          make[2]: *** [libmysql.lo] Error 1

     By default, the `configure' script attempts to determine the
     correct number of arguments by using `g++' the GNU C++ compiler.
     This test yields wrong results, if `g++' is not installed. There
     are two ways to work around this problem:

        * Make sure that the GNU C++ `g++' is installed. On some Linux
          distributions, the required package is called `gpp', on
          others it is named `gcc-c++'.

        * Use `gcc' as your C++ compiler by setting the `CXX'
          environment variable to `gcc':
               export CXX="gcc"

     Please note that you need to run `configure' again afterwards.



MIT-pthreads Notes
------------------

This section describes some of the issues involved in using
MIT-pthreads.

Note that on Linux you should *not* use MIT-pthreads but use the
installed LinuxThreads implementation instead.  *Note Linux::.

If your system does not provide native thread support, you will need to
build MySQL using the MIT-pthreads package.  This includes older
FreeBSD systems, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.4 and earlier, and some others.
*Note Which OS::.

Note that, beginning with MySQL 4.0.2, MIT-pthreads are no longer part
of the source distribution. If you require this package, you need to
download it separately from
<http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/pthreads-1_60_beta6-mysql.tar.gz>

After downloading, extract this source archive into the top level of the
MySQL source directory. It will create a new subdirectory
`mit-pthreads'.

   * On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
     `configure' with the `--with-mit-threads' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-mit-threads

     Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
     MIT-pthreads because we want to minimise our changes to this code.

   * The checks that determine whether to use MIT-pthreads occur only
     during the part of the configuration process that deals with the
     server code.  If you have configured the distribution using
     `--without-server' to build only the client code, clients will not
     know whether MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix socket
     connections by default.  Because Unix socket files do not work
     under MIT-pthreads on some platforms, this means you will need to
     use `-h' or `--host' when you run client programs.

   * When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
     disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the
     server to use system locking with the `--external-locking' option.
     This is only needed if you want to be able to run two MySQL
     servers against the same datafiles (not recommended).

   * Sometimes the pthread `bind()' command fails to bind to a socket
     without any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is
     that all connections to the server fail.  For example:

          shell> mysqladmin version
          mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
          error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'

     The solution to this is to kill the `mysqld' server and restart it.
     This has only happened to us when we have forced down the server
     and done a restart immediately.

   * With MIT-pthreads, the `sleep()' system call isn't interruptible
     with `SIGINT' (break).  This is only noticeable when you run
     `mysqladmin --sleep'.  You must wait for the `sleep()' call to
     terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

   * When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at
     least on Solaris); they can be ignored:

          ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
          ld: warning: symbol `__iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken

   * Some other warnings also can be ignored:

          implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
          implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'

   * We haven't gotten `readline' to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This
     isn't needed, but may be interesting for someone.)


Installing MySQL from Source on Windows
---------------------------------------

These instructions describe how to build MySQL binaries from source for
versions 4.1 and above on Windows. Instructions are provided for
building binaries from a standard source distribution or from the
BitKeeper tree that contains the latest development source.

*Note:* The instructions in this document are strictly for users who
want to test MySQL on Windows from the latest source distribution or
from the BitKeeper tree.  For production use, MySQL AB does not advise
using a MySQL server built by yourself from source.  Normally, it is
best to use precompiled binary distributions of MySQL that are built
specifically for optimal performance on Windows by MySQL AB.
Instructions for installing a binary distributions are available at
*Note Windows installation::.

To build MySQL on Windows from source, you need the following compiler
and resources available on your Windows system:

   * VC++ 6.0 compiler (updated with 4 or 5 SP and pre-processor
     package).  The pre-processor package is necessary for the macro
     assembler.  More details at:
     `http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/faq.aspx'.

   * Approximately 45 MB disk space.

   * 64 MB RAM.


You'll also need a MySQL source distribution for Windows.  There are
two ways you can get a source distribution for MySQL version 4.1 and
above:

  1. Obtain a source distribution packaged by MySQL AB for the
     particular version of MySQL in which you are interested.
     Prepackaged source distributions are available for released
     versions of MySQL and can be obtained from
     `http://www.mysql.com/downloads/'.

  2. You can package a source distribution yourself from the latest
     BitKeeper developer source tree. If you plan to do this, you must
     create the package on a Unix system and then transfer it to your
     Windows system.  (The reason for this is that some of the
     configuration and build steps require tools that work only on
     Unix.)  The BitKeeper approach thus requires:

        * A system running Unix, or a Unix-like system such as Linux.

        * BitKeeper 3.0 installed on that system. You can obtain
          BitKeeper from `http://www.bitkeeper.com/'.



If you are using a Windows source distribution, you can go directly to
*Note Windows VC++ Build::. To build from the BitKeeper tree, proceed to
*Note Windows BitKeeper Build::.

If you find something not working as expected, or you have suggestions
about ways to improve the current build process on Windows, please send
a message to the `win32' mailing list.  *Note Mailing-list::.

Building MySQL Using VC++
.........................

*Note:* MySQL 4.1 and above VC++ workspace files are compatible with
Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and above(7.0/.NET) editions and tested by
MySQL AB staff before each release.

Follow this procedure to build MySQL:

  1. Create a work directory (for example, `workdir').

  2. Unpack the source distribution in the aforementioned directory
     using `WinZip' or other Windows tools that can read `.zip' files.

  3. Start the VC++ 6.0 compiler.

  4. In the `File' menu, select `Open Workspace'.

  5. Open the `mysql.dsw' workspace you find in the work directory.

  6. From the `Build' menu, select the `Set Active Configuration' menu.

  7. Click over the screen selecting `mysqld - Win32 Debug' and click
     OK.

  8. Press `F7' to begin the build of the debug server, libraries, and
     some client applications.

  9. Compile the release versions that you want, in the same way.

 10. Debug versions of the programs and libraries are placed in the
     `client_debug' and `lib_debug' directories.  Release versions of
     the programs and libraries are placed in the `client_release' and
     `lib_release' directories.  Note that if you want to build both
     debug and release versions, you can select the "build all" option
     from the `Build' menu.

 11. Test the server.  The server built using the preceding instructions
     will expect that the MySQL base directory and data directory are
     `C:\mysql' and `C:\mysql\data' by default. If you want to test
     your server using the source tree root directory and its data
     directory as the base directory and data directory, you will need
     to tell the server their pathnames. You can either do this on the
     command line with the `--basedir' and `--datadir' options, or
     place appropriate options in an option file (`C:\my.cnf' or the
     `my.ini' file in your Windows directory). If you have an existing
     data directory elsewhere that you want to use, you can specify its
     pathname instead.

 12. Start your server from the `client_release' or `client_debug'
     directory, depending on which server you want to use. The general
     server startup instructions are at *Note Windows installation::.
     You'll need to to adapt the instructions appropriately if you want
     to use a different base directory or data directory.

 13. When the server is running in standalone fashion or as a service
     based on your configuration, try to connect to it from the `mysql'
     interactive command line utility that exists in your
     `client_release' or `client_debug' directory.


When you are satisifed that the programs you have built are working
correctly, stop the server. Then install MySQL as follows:

  1. Create the directories where you want to install MySQL.  For
     example, to install into `C:\mysql', use these commands:

          C:
          mkdir \mysql
          mkdir \mysql\bin
          mkdir \mysql\data
          mkdir \mysql\share
          mkdir \mysql\scripts

     If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you
     should also create several additional directories:

          mkdir \mysql\include
          mkdir \mysql\lib
          mkdir \mysql\lib\debug
          mkdir \mysql\lib\opt

     If you want to benchmark MySQL, create this directory:

          mkdir \mysql\sql-bench

     Benchmarking requires Perl support.

  2. From the `workdir' directory, copy into the `C:\mysql' directory
     the following directories:

          copy client_release\*.exe C:\mysql\bin
          copy client_debug\mysqld.exe C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-debug.exe
          xcopy scripts\*.* C:\mysql\scripts /E
          xcopy share\*.* C:\mysql\share /E

     If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you
     should also copy several libraries and header files:

          copy lib_debug\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\debug
          copy lib_debug\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
          copy lib_debug\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
          copy lib_release\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\opt
          copy lib_release\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
          copy lib_release\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
          copy include\*.h C:\mysql\include
          copy libmysql\libmysql.def C:\mysql\include

     If you want to benchmark MySQL, you should also do this:

          xcopy sql-bench\*.* C:\mysql\bench /E


Set up and start the server in the same way as for the binary Windows
distribution.  *Note Windows installation::.


Creating a Windows Source Package from the Latest Development Source
....................................................................

To create a Windows source package from the current BitKeeper source
tree, use the following instructions. Please note that this procedure
must be performed on a system running a Unix or Unix-like operating
system.  (The procedure is known to work well on Linux, for example.)

  1. Clone the BitKeeper source tree for MySQL (version 4.1 or above,
     as desired).  For more information how to clone the source tree,
     see the instructions at *Note Installing source tree::.

  2. Configure and build the distribution so that you have a server
     binary to work with.  One way to do this is to run the following
     command in the top-level directory of your source tree:

          shell> ./BUILD/compile-pentium-max

  3. After making sure that the build process completed successfully,
     run the following utility script from top-level directory of your
     source tree:

          shell> ./scripts/make_win_src_distribution

     This script creates a Windows source package, to be used on your
     Windows system.  You can supply different options to the script
     based on your needs. It accepts the following options:

          --debug   Print information about script operations, do not create package
          --tmp     Specify the temporary location
          --suffix  Suffix name for the package
          --dirname Directory name to copy files (intermediate)
          --silent  Do not print verbose list of files processed
          --tar     Create tar.gz package instead of .zip package
          --help    Show this help message

     By default, `make_win_src_distribution' creates a zipped archive
     with the name `mysql-VERSION-win-src.zip', where `VERSION'
     represents the version of your MySQL source tree.

  4. Copy or upload to your Windows machine the Windows source package
     that you have just created. To compile it, use the instructions in
     *Note Windows VC++ Build::.



Compiling MySQL Clients on Windows
----------------------------------

In your source files, you should include `my_global.h' before `mysql.h':

     #include <my_global.h>
     #include <mysql.h>

`my_global.h' includes any other files needed for Windows compatibility
(such as `windows.h') if you compile your program on Windows.

You can either link your code with the dynamic `libmysql.lib' library,
which is just a wrapper to load in `libmysql.dll' on demand, or link
with the static `mysqlclient.lib' library.

Note that because the MySQL client libraries are compiled as threaded
libraries, you should also compile your code to be multi-threaded!


Post-installation Setup and Testing
===================================

There are some issues you should address after installing MySQL.  For
example, on Unix, you should create the MySQL grant tables.  On all
platforms, an important security concern is that the initial accounts
in the grant tables have no passwords.  You should assign passwords to
prevent unauthorized access to the MySQL server.

The following sections describe post-installation procedures for Windows
systems and for Unix systems.

* Menu:

* Windows post-installation::   Windows Post-installation Procedures
* Unix post-installation::      Unix Post-installation Procedures


Windows Post-installation Procedures
------------------------------------

On Windows, the grant tables do not have to be created. MySQL Windows
distributions include the grant tables already set up in the `mysql'
database under the `data' directory.  However, you should assign
passwords to the accounts.

The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges
to all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL more
secure, you should set a password for all users and remove the row in
the `mysql.user' table that has `Host='localhost'' and `User='''.

You should also add a password for the `root' user. The following
example starts by removing the anonymous user that has all privileges,
then sets a `root' user password:

     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql mysql
     mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
     mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     mysql> QUIT
     C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password your_password

After you've set the password, if you want to shut down the `mysqld'
server, you can do so using this command:

     C:\> mysqladmin --user=root --password=your_password shutdown

If you are using a server from a _very_ old version of MySQL, the
`mysqladmin' command to set the password will fail with an error:
`parse error near 'SET password''.  The solution to this problem is to
upgrade to a newer version of MySQL.

With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users and change
privileges with `GRANT' and `REVOKE' commands.  *Note `GRANT': GRANT.


Unix Post-installation Procedures
---------------------------------

* Menu:

* mysql_install_db::            Problems Running `mysql_install_db'
* Automatic start::             Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically
* Starting server::             Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server

After you install MySQL on Unix, you need to initialize the grant
tables, start the server, and make sure that the server works okay.
You may also wish to arrange for the server to be started and stopped
automatically when your system starts and stops.

Normally you install the grant tables and start the server like this
for installation from a source distribution:

     shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
     shell> bin/mysql_install_db
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For a binary distribution (not RPM or PKG packages), do this:

     shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

The `mysql_install_db' script creates the `mysql' database that holds
all database privileges, and the `test' database that you can use to
test MySQL. The script also creates privilege table entries for `root'
accounts and anonymous-user accounts.  The entries are created without
passwords.  The `mysqld_safe' script starts the `mysqld' server.  (For
versions of MySQL older than 4.0, use `safe_mysqld' rather than
`mysqld_safe'.)

`mysql_install_db' will not overwrite any old privilege tables, so it
should be safe to run in any circumstances.  If you don't want to have
the `test' database you can remove it with `mysqladmin -u root drop
test' after starting the server.

Testing is most easily done from the top-level directory of the MySQL
distribution.  For a binary distribution, this is your installation
directory (typically something like `/usr/local/mysql').  For a source
distribution, this is the main directory of your MySQL source tree.

In the commands shown in this section and in the following subsections,
`BINDIR' is the path to the location in which programs like
`mysqladmin' and `mysqld_safe' are installed.  For a binary
distribution, this is the `bin' directory within the distribution.  For
a source distribution, `BINDIR' is probably `/usr/local/bin', unless
you specified an installation directory other than `/usr/local' when
you ran `configure'.  `EXECDIR' is the location in which the `mysqld'
server is installed.  For a binary distribution, this is the same as
`BINDIR'.  For a source distribution, `EXECDIR' is probably
`/usr/local/libexec'.

Testing is described in detail:

  1. If necessary, start the `mysqld' server and set up the initial
     MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
     users are allowed to connect to the server.  This is normally done
     with the `mysql_install_db' script:

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db

     Typically, `mysql_install_db' needs to be run only the first time
     you install MySQL.  Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
     installation, you can skip this step.  (However,
     `mysql_install_db' is quite safe to use and will not update any
     tables that already exist, so if you are unsure of what to do, you
     can always run `mysql_install_db'.)

     `mysql_install_db' creates six tables (`user', `db', `host',
     `tables_priv', `columns_priv', and `func') in the `mysql'
     database.  A description of the initial privileges is given in
     *Note Default privileges::.  Briefly, these privileges allow the
     MySQL `root' user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or
     use databases with a name of `test' or starting with `test_'.

     If you don't set up the grant tables, the following error will
     appear in the log file when you start the server:

          mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'

     This may also happen with a binary MySQL distribution if you don't
     start MySQL by executing exactly `./bin/mysqld_safe'.  *Note
     `mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe.

     You might need to run `mysql_install_db' as `root'.  However, if
     you prefer, you can run the MySQL server as an unprivileged
     (non-`root') user, provided that the user can read and write files
     in the database directory.  Instructions for running MySQL as an
     unprivileged user are given in *Note Changing MySQL user: Changing
     MySQL user.

     If you have problems with `mysql_install_db', see *Note
     `mysql_install_db': mysql_install_db.

     There are some alternatives to running the `mysql_install_db'
     script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:

        * You may want to edit `mysql_install_db' before running it, to
          change the initial privileges that are installed into the
          grant tables.  This is useful if you want to install MySQL on
          a lot of machines with the same privileges.  In this case you
          probably should need only to add a few extra `INSERT'
          statements to the `mysql.user' and `mysql.db' tables.

        * If you want to change the contents of the grant tables after
          installing them, you can run `mysql_install_db', then use
          `mysql -u root mysql' to connect to the grant tables as the
          MySQL `root' user and issue SQL statements to modify the
          grant tables directly.

        * It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after
          they have already been created.  You might want to do this if
          you've already installed the tables but then want to
          re-create them after editing `mysql_install_db'.

     For more information about these alternatives, see *Note Default
     privileges::.

  2. Start the MySQL server like this:

          shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
          shell> bin/mysqld_safe &

     For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld'
     for `bin/mysqld_safe' in the final command.

     If you have problems starting the server, see *Note Starting
     server::.

  3. Use `mysqladmin' to verify that the server is running.  The
     following commands provide a simple test to check that the server
     is up and responding to connections:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin version
          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin variables

     The output from `mysqladmin version' varies slightly depending on
     your platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that
     shown here:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin version
          mysqladmin  Ver 8.40 Distrib 4.0.18, for linux on i586
          Copyright (C) 2000 MySQL AB & MySQL Finland AB & TCX DataKonsult AB

          Queries per second avg: 0.000
          Memory in use: 132K  Max memory used: 16773K

     To see what else you can do with `mysqladmin', invoke it with the
     `--help' option.

  4. Verify that you can shut down the server:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqladmin -u root shutdown

  5. Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this using
     `mysqld_safe' or by invoking `mysqld' directly.  For example:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqld_safe --log &

     If `mysqld_safe' fails, try running it from the MySQL installation
     directory (if you are not already there).  If that doesn't work,
     see *Note Starting server::.

  6. Run some simple tests to verify that the server is working.  The
     output should be similar to what is shown here:

          shell> BINDIR/mysqlshow
          +-----------+
          | Databases |
          +-----------+
          | mysql     |
          +-----------+
          
          shell> BINDIR/mysqlshow mysql
          Database: mysql
          +--------------+
          |    Tables    |
          +--------------+
          | columns_priv |
          | db           |
          | func         |
          | host         |
          | tables_priv  |
          | user         |
          +--------------+
          
          shell> BINDIR/mysql -e "SELECT host,db,user FROM db" mysql
          +------+--------+------+
          | host | db     | user |
          +------+--------+------+
          | %    | test   |      |
          | %    | test_% |      |
          +------+--------+------+

     There is also a benchmark suite in the `sql-bench' directory
     (under the MySQL installation directory) that you can use to
     compare how MySQL performs on different platforms. The benchmark
     suite is written in Perl. It uses the Perl DBI module to provide a
     database-independent interface to the various databases. The
     following additional Perl modules are required to run the
     benchmark suite:

          DBI
          DBD::mysql
          Data::Dumper
          Data::ShowTable

     These modules can be obtained from CPAN `http://www.cpan.org/'.
     *Note Perl installation::.

     The `sql-bench/Results' directory contains the results from many
     runs against different databases and platforms.  To run all tests,
     execute these commands:

          shell> cd sql-bench
          shell> run-all-tests

     If you don't have the `sql-bench' directory, you probably
     installed MySQL using RPM files other than the source RPM.  (The
     source RPM includes the `sql-bench' benchmark directory.)  In this
     case, you must first install the benchmark suite before you can
     use it.  Beginning with MySQL Version 3.22, there are separate
     benchmark RPM files named `mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm' that
     contain benchmark code and data.

     If you have a source distribution, there are also tests in its
     `tests' subdirectory that you can run. For example, to run
     `auto_increment.tst', do this:

          shell> BINDIR/mysql -vvf test < ./tests/auto_increment.tst

     The expected result of the test can be found in the
     `./tests/auto_increment.res' file.


Problems Running `mysql_install_db'
...................................

The purpose of the `mysql_install_db' script is to generate new MySQL
privilege tables.  It will not overwrite existing MySQL privilege
tables, and it will not affect any other data.

If you want to re-create your privilege tables, you should take down
the `mysqld' server, if it's running, and then do something like:

     mv mysql-data-directory/mysql mysql-data-directory/mysql-old
     mysql_install_db

This section lists problems you might encounter when you run
`mysql_install_db':

*`mysql_install_db' doesn't install the grant tables*
     You may find that `mysql_install_db' fails to install the grant
     tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:

          Starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
          mysqld ended

     In this case, you should examine the log file very carefully.  The
     log should be located in the directory `XXXXXX' named by the error
     message, and should indicate why `mysqld' didn't start.  If you
     don't understand what happened, include the log when you post a
     bug report.  *Note Bug reports::.

*There is already a `mysqld' process running*
     In this case, you probably don't have to run `mysql_install_db' at
     all.  You have to run `mysql_install_db' only once, when you
     install MySQL the first time.

*Installing a second `mysqld' server doesn't work when one server is running*
     This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL
     installation, but want to put a new installation in a different
     location (for example, for testing, or perhaps you simply want to
     run two installations at the same time).  Generally the problem
     that occurs when you try to run the second server is that it tries
     to use the same socket and port as the old one.  In this case you
     will get the error message: `Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP
     port: Address already in use' or `Can't start server: Bind on unix
     socket...'. *Note Multiple servers::.

*You don't have write access to `/tmp'*
     If you don't have write access to create a socket file at the
     default place (in `/tmp') or permission to create temporary files
     in `/tmp,' you will get an error when running `mysql_install_db'
     or when starting or using `mysqld'.

     You can specify a different socket and temporary directory as
     follows:

          shell> TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
          shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysqld.sock
          shell> export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT

     See *Note Problems with `mysql.sock': Problems with mysql.sock.

     `some_tmp_dir' should be the path to some directory for which you
     have write permission. *Note Environment variables::.

     After this, you should be able to run `mysql_install_db' and start
     the server with these commands:

          shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
          shell> BINDIR/mysqld_safe &

*`mysqld' crashes immediately*
     If you are running Red Hat Version 5.0 with a version of `glibc'
     older than 2.0.7-5, you should make sure you have installed all
     `glibc' patches.  There is a lot of information about this in the
     MySQL mail archives.  Links to the mail archives are available
     online at `http://lists.mysql.com/'.  Also, see *Note Linux::.

     You can also start `mysqld' manually using the
     `--skip-grant-tables' option and add the privilege information
     yourself using `mysql':

          shell> BINDIR/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
          shell> BINDIR/mysql -u root mysql

     From `mysql', manually execute the SQL commands in
     `mysql_install_db'.  Make sure you run `mysqladmin
     flush-privileges' or `mysqladmin reload' afterward to tell the
     server to reload the grant tables.


Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically
.........................................

Generally, you start the `mysqld' server in one of these ways:

   * By invoking `mysqld' directly. This works on any platform.

   * By running the MySQL server as a Windows service.  This can be
     done on Windows NT, 2000, and XP.  For instructions, see *Note NT
     start::.

   * By invoking `mysql.server'.  This script is used primarily at
     system startup and shutdown on systems that use System V-style run
     directories. It is described more fully later in this section.

   * By invoking `mysqld_safe', which tries to determine the proper
     options for `mysqld' and then runs it with those options.  This
     script is used on systems based on BSD Unix. It also is invoked by
     `mysql.server'.  *Note `mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe.

The `mysql.server' and `mysqld_safe' scripts can be used to start the
server automatically at system startup time. `mysql.server' can also be
used to stop the server.

The `mysql.server' script can be used to start or stop the server by
invoking it with `start' or `stop' arguments:

     shell> mysql.server start
     shell> mysql.server stop

`mysql.server' can be found in the `share/mysql' directory under the
MySQL installation directory or in the `support-files' directory of the
MySQL source tree.

Note that if you use the Linux RPM package
(`MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm'), the `mysql.server' script has already
been installed as `/etc/init.d/mysql'. You don't have to install it
manually. See *Note Linux-RPM:: for more information on the Linux RPM
packages.

On Mac OS X, you can install a separate MySQL Startup Item package to
enable the automatic startup of MySQL on system bootup.  See *Note Mac
OS X installation:: for details.

Before `mysql.server' starts the server, it changes the directory to
the MySQL installation directory, then invokes `mysqld_safe'.  You
might need to edit `mysql.server' if you have a binary distribution
that you've installed in a non-standard location.  Modify it to `cd'
into the proper directory before it runs `mysqld_safe'. If you want the
server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate `user' line to
the `/etc/my.cnf' file, as shown later in this section.

`mysql.server stop' brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can also stop the server manually by executing `mysqladmin
shutdown'.

You need to add these start and stop commands to the appropriate places
in your `/etc/rc*' files when you want to start up MySQL automatically
on your server.

On most current Linux distributions, it is sufficient to copy the file
`mysql.server' into the `/etc/init.d' directory (or `/etc/rc.d/init.d'
on older Red Hat systems). Afterwards, run the following command to
enable the startup of MySQL on system bootup:

     shell> chkconfig --add mysql.server

On FreeBSD startup scripts generally should go in
`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/'. The `rc(8)' manual page also states that
scripts in this directory are only executed, if their basename matches
the shell globbing pattern `*.sh'. Any other files or directories
present within the directory are silently ignored. In other words, on
FreeBSD you should install the file `mysql.server' as
`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh' to enable automatic startup.

As an alternative to the above, some operating systems also use
`/etc/rc.local' or `/etc/init.d/boot.local' to start additional
services on bootup. To start up MySQL using this method, you could
append something like the following to it:

     /bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &'

You can also add options for `mysql.server' in a global `/etc/my.cnf'
file.  A typical `/etc/my.cnf' file might look like this:

     [mysqld]
     datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
     socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
     port=3306
     user=mysql
     
     [mysql.server]
     basedir=/usr/local/mysql

The `mysql.server' script understands the following options: `datadir',
`basedir', and `pid-file'.

The following table shows which option groups each startup script reads
from option files:

*Script*    *Option groups*
`mysqld'    `[mysqld]', `[server]' and `[mysqld-major-version]'
`mysql.server'`[mysql.server]', `[mysqld]', and `[server]'
`mysqld_safe'`[mysqld]', `[server]', and `[mysqld_safe]'

For backward compatibility, `mysql.server' also reads the
`[mysql_server]' group and `mysqld_safe' also reads the `[safe_mysqld]'
group. However, you should update your option files to use the
`[mysql.server]' and `[mysqld_safe]' groups instead.

*Note Option files::.


Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server
.............................................

If you are going to use storage engines that support transactional
tables (`InnoDB', `BDB'), you should first create a `my.cnf' file and
set startup options for the engines you plan to use. *Note Table
types::.

When the `mysqld' server starts, it changes location to the data
directory.  This is where it expects to write log files and the pid
(process ID) file, and where it expects to find databases.

The data directory location is hardwired in when the distribution is
compiled.  However, if `mysqld' expects to find the data directory
somewhere other than where it really is on your system, it will not work
properly.  If you have problems with incorrect paths, you can find out
what options `mysqld' allows and what the default path settings are by
invoking `mysqld' with the `--help' option.  You can override the
defaults by specifying the correct pathnames as command-line arguments
to `mysqld'.  (These options can be used with `mysqld_safe' as well.)

Normally you should need to tell `mysqld' only the base directory under
which MySQL is installed.  You can do this with the `--basedir' option.
You can also use `--help' to check the effect of changing path options
(note that `--help' *must* be the final option of the `mysqld'
command).  For example:

     shell> EXECDIR/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --help

Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
the `--help' option.

Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically `/usr/local/mysql/data'
for a binary distribution, `/usr/local/var' for a source distribution,
and `\mysql\data\mysql.err' on Windows).  Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form `host_name.err' and `host_name.log' where
`host_name' is the name of your server host.  Then check the last few
lines of these files:

     shell> tail host_name.err
     shell> tail host_name.log

Look for something like the following in the log file:
     000729 14:50:10  bdb:  Recovery function for LSN 1 27595 failed
     000729 14:50:10  bdb:  warning: ./test/t1.db: No such file or directory
     000729 14:50:10  Can't init databases

This means that you didn't start `mysqld' with `--bdb-no-recover' and
Berkeley DB found something wrong with its log files when it tried to
recover your databases.  To be able to continue, you should move away
the old Berkeley DB log file from the database directory to some other
place, where you can later examine it.  The log files are named
`log.0000000001', where the number will increase over time.

If you are running `mysqld' with `BDB' table support and `mysqld' core
dumps at start this could be because of some problems with the `BDB'
recovery log.  In this case you can try starting `mysqld' with
`--bdb-no-recover'.  If this helps, then you should remove all `log.*'
files from the data directory and try starting `mysqld' again.

If you get the following error, it means that some other program (or
another `mysqld' server) is already using the TCP/IP port or socket
`mysqld' is trying to use:

     Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
or:
     Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...

Use `ps' to make sure that you don't have another `mysqld' server
running.  If you can't find another server running, you can try to
execute the command `telnet your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number' and press
Enter a couple of times.  If you don't get an error message like
`telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused',
something is using the TCP/IP port `mysqld' is trying to use.  See
*Note mysql_install_db:: and *Note Multiple servers::.

If `mysqld' is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

     shell> mysqladmin variables

or:

     shell> mysqladmin -h 'your-host-name' variables

If you get `Errcode 13', which means `Permission denied', when starting
`mysqld' this means that you didn't have the right to read/create files
in the MySQL database or log directory. In this case you should either
start `mysqld' as the `root' user or change the permissions for the
involved files and directories so that you have the right to use them.

If `mysqld_safe' starts the server but you can't connect to it, you
should make sure you have an entry in `/etc/hosts' that looks like this:

     127.0.0.1       localhost

This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

If you can't get `mysqld' to start you can try to make a trace file to
find the problem. *Note Making trace files::.

If you are using `InnoDB' tables, refer to the `InnoDB'-specific startup
options.  *Note InnoDB start::.

If you are using `BDB' (Berkeley DB) tables, you should familiarise
yourself with the different `BDB'-specific startup options.  *Note BDB
start::.


Upgrading/Downgrading MySQL
===========================

As a general rule, we recommend that when upgrading from one release
series to another, you should go to the next series rather than
skipping a series. For example, if you currently are running MySQL 3.23
and wish to upgrade to a newer series, upgrade to MySQL 4.0 rather than
to 4.1 or 5.0.

Before you do an upgrade, you should back up your old databases.

You can always move the MySQL format files and datafiles between
different versions on the same architecture as long as you have the
same base version of MySQL. The current base version is 4. If you
change the character set when running MySQL, you must run `myisamchk -r
-q --set-character-set=charset' on all tables.  Otherwise, your indexes
may not be ordered correctly, because changing the character set may
also change the sort order.

If you are cautious about using new versions, you can always rename
your old `mysqld' to something like `mysqld-old-version-number'.  If
your new `mysqld' then does something unexpected, you can simply shut
it down and restart with your old `mysqld'.

If, after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client
programs, such as `Commands out of sync' or unexpected core dumps, you
probably have used an old header or library file when compiling your
programs.  In this case you should check the date for your `mysql.h'
file and `libmysqlclient.a' library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs.

If problems occur, such as that the new `mysqld' server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, check that you don't
have some old `my.cnf' file from your old installation.  You can check
this with: `program-name --print-defaults'.  If this outputs anything
other than the program name, you have an active `my.cnf' file that
affects server operation.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the Perl `DBD::mysql' module
whenever you install a new release of MySQL. The same applies to other
MySQL interfaces as well, such as the Python `MySQLdb' module.

Upgrading from Version 4.1 to 5.0
---------------------------------

In general, you should do the following when upgrading to MySQL 5.0
from an earlier version:

   * Read the 5.0 news items to see what significant new features you
     can use in 5.0.  *Note News-5.0.x::.

   * If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, please also see *Note
     Windows upgrading::.

   * If you are using replication, please also see *Note Replication
     Upgrade:: for information on upgrading your replication setup.

   * MySQL 5.0 adds support for stored procedures. This support
     requires the `proc' table in the `mysql' database.  To create this
     file you should run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script.  This
     is described in *Note Upgrading-grant-tables::.



Upgrading from Version 4.0 to 4.1
---------------------------------

Several visible behaviors have changed between MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1
to fix some critical bugs and make MySQL more compatible with the ANSI
SQL standard. These changes may affect your applications.

Some of the 4.1 behaviors can be tested in 4.0 before performing a full
upgrade to 4.1. We have added to later MySQL 4.0 releases (from 4.0.12
on) a `--new' startup option for `mysqld'.

This option gives you the 4.1 behavior for the most critical changes.
You can also enable these behaviors for a given client connection with
the `SET @@new=1' command, or turn them off if they are on with `SET
@@new=0'.

If you believe that some of the 4.1 changes will affect you, we
recommend that before upgrading to 4.1, you download the latest MySQL
4.0 version and run it with the `--new' option by adding the following
to your config file:

     [mysqld-4.0]
     new

That way you can test the new behaviors in 4.0 to make sure that your
applications work with them. This will help you have a smooth painless
transition when you perform a full upgrade to 4.1 later.  Doing it the
above way will ensure that you don't accidently later run the 4.1
version with the `--new' option.

The following list describes changes that may affect applications and
that you should watch out for when upgrading to version 4.1:

   * `TIMESTAMP' is now returned as a string in `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS''
     format.  (The `--new' option can be used from 4.0.12 on to make a
     4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this respect.)  If you want to have
     the value returned as a number (like Version 4.0 does) you should
     add +0 to `TIMESTAMP' columns when you retrieve them:

          mysql> SELECT ts_col + 0 FROM tbl_name;

     Display widths for `TIMESTAMP' columns are no longer supported.
     For example, if you declare a column as `TIMESTAMP(10)', the `(10)'
     is ignored.

     These changes were necessary for SQL standards compliance. In a
     future version, a further change will be made (backward compatible
     with this change), allowing the timestamp length to indicate the
     desired number of digits for fractions of a second.

   * Binary values such as `0xFFDF' now are assumed to be strings
     instead of numbers.  This fixes some problems with character sets
     where it's convenient to input a string as a binary value.  With
     this change, you should use `CAST()' if you want to compare binary
     values numerically as integers:

          mysql> SELECT CAST(0xFEFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER) < CAST(0xFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER);
                  -> 0

     If you don't use `CAST()', a lexical string comparison will be
     done:

          mysql> SELECT 0xFEFF < 0xFF;
                  -> 1

     Using binary items in a numeric context or comparing them using the
     `=' operator should work as before.  (The `--new' option can be
     used from 4.0.13 on to make a 4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this
     respect.)

   * For functions that produce a `DATE', `DATETIME', or `TIME' value,
     the result returned to the client now is fixed up to have a
     temporal type. For example, in MySQL 4.1, you get this result:

          mysql> SELECT CAST("2001-1-1" as DATETIME);
              -> '2001-01-01 00:00:00'

     In MySQL 4.0, the result is different:

          mysql> SELECT CAST("2001-1-1" as DATETIME);
              -> '2001-01-01'

   * `DEFAULT' values no longer can be specified for `AUTO_INCREMENT'
     columns. (In 4.0, a `DEFAULT' value is silently ignored; in 4.1,
     an error occurs).

   * `LIMIT' no longer accept negative arguments.  Use
     18446744073709551615 instead of -1.

   * `SERIALIZE' is no longer a valid mode value for the `sql_mode'
     variable.  You should use `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
     SERIALIZABLE' instead. `SERIALIZE' is no longer valid for the
     `--sql-mode' option for `mysqld', either. Use
     `--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE' instead.

   * All tables and string columns now have a character set.  *Note
     Charset::.  Character set information is displayed by `SHOW CREATE
     TABLE' and `mysqldump'.  (MySQL versions 4.0.6 and above can read
     the new dump files; older versions cannot.)

   * The table definition format used in `.frm' files has changed
     slightly in 4.1.  MySQL 4.0 versions from 4.0.11 on can read the
     new `.frm' format directly, but older versions cannot.  If you
     need to move tables from 4.1 to a version earlier than 4.0.11, you
     should use `mysqldump'.  *Note `mysqldump': mysqldump.

   * If you are running multiple servers on the same Windows machine,
     you should use a different `--shared_memory_base_name' option on
     all machines.

   * The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. You
     must now declare a `xxx_clear()' function for each aggregate
     function `XXX()'.


In general, upgrading to 4.1 from an earlier MySQL version involves the
following steps:

   * Check the changes listed earlier in this section to see whether
     there are any that may affect your applications.

   * Read the 4.1 news items to see what significant new features you
     can use in 4.1.  *Note News-4.1.x::.

   * If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, please also see *Note
     Windows upgrading::.

     *Important note:* Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1
     do not contain any installer program.  See *Note Windows binary
     installation:: for instructions on how to install such a
     distribution.

   * If you are using replication, please also see *Note Replication
     Upgrade:: for information on upgrading your replication setup.

   * After upgrading, update the grant tables to generate the new
     longer `Password' column that is needed for secure handling of
     passwords.  The procedure uses `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' and is
     described in *Note Upgrading-grant-tables::.


The password hashing mechanism has changed in 4.1 to provide better
security, but this may cause compatibility problems if you still have
clients that use the client library from 4.0 or earlier.  (It is very
likely that you will have 4.0 clients in situations where clients
connect from remote hosts that have not yet upgraded to 4.1).  The
following list indicates some possible upgrade strategies.  They
represent various tradeoffs between the goal of compatibility with old
clients and the goal of security.

   * Don't upgrade to 4.1. No behavior will change, but you cannot use
     any of the new features provided by the 4.1 client/server protocol,
     either.  (MySQL 4.1 has an extended client/server protocol that
     offers such features as prepared statements and multiple result
     sets.)  *Note C API Prepared statements::.

   * Upgrade to 4.1 and run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script to
     widen the `Password' column in the `user' table so that it can
     hold long password hashes.  But run the server with the
     `--old-passwords' option to provide backward compatibility that
     allows pre-4.1 clients to continue to connect to their short-hash
     accounts.  Eventually, when all your clients are upgraded to 4.1,
     you can stop using the `--old-passwords' server option. You can
     also change the passwords for your MySQL accounts to use the new
     more secure format.

   * Upgrade to 4.1 and run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script to
     widen the `Password' column in the `user' table.  If you know that
     all clients also have been upgraded to 4.1, don't run the server
     with the `--old-passwords' option.  Instead, change the passwords
     on all existing accounts so that they have the new format.  A
     pure-4.1 installation is the most secure.


Further background on password hashing with respect to client
authentication and password-changing operations may be found in *Note
Password hashing::.


Upgrading from Version 3.23 to 4.0
----------------------------------

In general, you should do the following when upgrading to MySQL 4.0
from an earlier version:

   * After upgrading, update the grant tables to add new privileges and
     features.  The procedure uses the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables'
     script and is described in *Note Upgrading-grant-tables::.

   * Edit any MySQL startup scripts or configure files to not use any
     of the deprecated options described later in this section.

   * Convert your old `ISAM' files to `MyISAM' files with the
     `mysql_convert_table_format database' script. (This is a Perl
     script; it requires that DBI be installed.) To convert the tables
     in a given database, use this command:

          shell> mysql_convert_table_format database db_name

     Note that this should only be used if all tables in the given
     database are `ISAM' or `MyISAM' tables. To avoid converting tables
     of other types to `MyISAM', you can explicitly list the names of
     your `ISAM' tables after the database name on the command line.
     You can also issue a `ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM'
     statement for each `ISAM' table to convert it to `MyISAM'.

     To find out the table type for a given table, use this statement:

          mysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tbl_name';

   * Ensure that you don't have any MySQL clients that use shared
     libraries (like the Perl `DBD::mysql' module). If you do, you
     should recompile them, because the data structures used in
     `libmysqlclient.so' have changed.  The same applies to other MySQL
     interfaces as well, such as the Python `MySQLdb' module.

   * If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, please also see *Note
     Windows upgrading::.

   * If you are using replication, please also see *Note Replication
     Upgrade:: for information on upgrading your replication setup.


MySQL 4.0 will work even if you don't do the above, but you will not be
able to use the new security privileges that MySQL 4.0 and you may run
into problems when upgrading later to MySQL 4.1 or newer.  The `ISAM'
file format still works in MySQL 4.0 but it's deprecated and will be
disabled (not compiled in by default) in MySQL 4.1. `MyISAM' tables
should be used instead.

Old clients should work with a Version 4.0 server without any problems.

Even if you do the above, you can still downgrade to MySQL 3.23.52 or
newer if you run into problems with the MySQL 4.0 series.  In this
case, you must use `mysqldump' to dump any tables that use full-text
indexes and reload the dump file into the 3.23 server.  This is
necessary because 4.0 uses a new format for full-text indexing.

The following is a more complete list that tells what you must watch out
for when upgrading to version 4.0:

   * MySQL 4.0 has a lot of new privileges in the `mysql.user' table.
     *Note `GRANT': GRANT.

     To get these new privileges to work, you must update the grant
     tables.  The procedure is described in *Note
     Upgrading-grant-tables::.  Until you do this, all users have the
     `SHOW DATABASES', `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES', and `LOCK TABLES'
     privileges. `SUPER' and `EXECUTE' privileges take their value from
     `PROCESS'.  `REPLICATION SLAVE' and `REPLICATION CLIENT' take their
     values from `FILE'.

     If you have any scripts that create new users, you may want to
     change them to use the new privileges.  If you are not using
     `GRANT' commands in the scripts, this is a good time to change
     your scripts to use `GRANT' instead of modifying the grant tables
     directly..

     From version 4.0.2 on, the option `--safe-show-database' is
     deprecated (and no longer does anything). *Note Privileges
     options::.

     If you get `Access denied' errors for new users in version 4.0.2
     and up, you should check if you need some of the new grants that
     you didn't need before.  In particular, you will need `REPLICATION
     SLAVE' (instead of `FILE') for new slaves.

   * `safe_mysqld' is renamed to `mysqld_safe'.  For backward
     compatibility, binary distributions will for some time include
     `safe_mysqld' as a symlink to `mysqld_safe'.

   * InnoDB support is now included by default in binary distributions.
     If you build MySQL from source, InnoDB is configured in by default.
     If you do not use InnoDB and want to save memory when running a
     server that has InnoDB support enabled, use the `--skip-innodb'
     server startup option. To compile MySQL without InnoDB support,
     run `configure' with the `--without-innodb' option.

   * The startup parameters `myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size' and
     `myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size' are now given in bytes (they
     were given in megabytes before 4.0.3).

   * External system locking of `MyISAM'/`ISAM' files is now turned off
     by default.  Your can turn this on by doing `--external-locking'.
     (However, this is never needed for most users.)

   * The following startup variables/options have been renamed:

     *Old Name*                         *New Name*
     `myisam_bulk_insert_tree_size'     `bulk_insert_buffer_size'
     `query_cache_startup_type'         `query_cache_type'
     `record_buffer'                    `read_buffer_size'
     `record_rnd_buffer'                `read_rnd_buffer_size'
     `sort_buffer'                      `sort_buffer_size'
     `warnings'                         `log-warnings'
     `--err-log'                        `--log-error' (for `mysqld_safe')

     The startup options `record_buffer', `sort_buffer' and `warnings'
     will still work in MySQL 4.0 but are deprecated.

   * The following SQL variables have changed name.

     *Old Name*                         *New Name*
     `SQL_BIG_TABLES'                   `BIG_TABLES'
     `SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES'         `LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES'
     `SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE'                `MAX_JOIN_SIZE'
     `SQL_QUERY_CACHE_TYPE'             `QUERY_CACHE_TYPE'
     The old names still work in MySQL 4.0 but are deprecated.

   * You have to use `SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#' instead of
     `SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#'.

   * The `mysqld' startup options `--skip-locking' and
     `--enable-locking' were renamed to `--skip-external-locking' and
     `--external-locking'.

   * `SHOW MASTER STATUS' now returns an empty set if binary logging is
     not enabled.

   * `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' now returns an empty set if slave is not
     initialized.

   * `mysqld' now has the option `--temp-pool' enabled by default as
     this gives better performance with some operating systems (most
     notably Linux).

   * `DOUBLE' and `FLOAT' columns now honor the `UNSIGNED' flag on
     storage (before, `UNSIGNED' was ignored for these columns).

   * `ORDER BY col_name DESC' sorts `NULL' values last, as of MySQL
     4.0.11. In 3.23 and in earlier 4.0 versions, this was not always
     consistent.

   * `SHOW INDEX' has two more columns (`Null' and `Index_type') than
     it had in 3.23.

   * `CHECK', `LOCALTIME' and `LOCALTIMESTAMP' are now reserved words.

   * The result of all bitwise operators (`|', `&', `<<', `>>', and
     `~')) is now unsigned.  This may cause problems if you are using
     them in a context where you want a signed result.  *Note Cast
     Functions::.

   * *Note:* when you use subtraction between integer values where one
     is of type `UNSIGNED', the result will be unsigned.  In other
     words, before upgrading to MySQL 4.0, you should check your
     application for cases where you are subtracting a value from an
     unsigned entity and want a negative answer or subtracting an
     unsigned value from an integer column. You can disable this
     behavior by using the `--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION' option
     when starting `mysqld'.  *Note Cast Functions::.

   * To use `MATCH ... AGAINST (... IN BOOLEAN MODE)' with your tables,
     you need to rebuild them with `REPAIR TABLE table_name USE_FRM'.

   * `LOCATE()' and `INSTR()' are case-sensitive if one of the
     arguments is a binary string. Otherwise they are case-insensitive.

   * `STRCMP()' now uses the current character set when performing
     comparisons.  This makes the default comparison behavior case
     insensitive unless one or both of the operands are binary strings.

   * `HEX(string)' now returns the characters in `string' converted to
     hexadecimal.  If you want to convert a number to hexadecimal, you
     should ensure that you call `HEX()' with a numeric argument.

   * In 3.23, `INSERT INTO ... SELECT' always had `IGNORE' enabled.  In
     4.0.1, MySQL will stop (and possibly roll back) by default in case
     of an error unless you specify `IGNORE'.

   * The old C API functions `mysql_drop_db()', `mysql_create_db()', and
     `mysql_connect()' are no longer supported unless you compile MySQL
     with `CFLAGS=-DUSE_OLD_FUNCTIONS'.  However, it is preferable to
     change client programs to use the new 4.0 API instead.

   * In the `MYSQL_FIELD' structure, `length' and `max_length' have
     changed from `unsigned int' to `unsigned long'. This should not
     cause any problems, except that they may generate warning messages
     when used as arguments in the `printf()' class of functions.

   * You should use `TRUNCATE TABLE' when you want to delete all rows
     from a table and you don't need to obtain a count of the number of
     rows that were deleted.  (`DELETE FROM table_name' returns a row
     count in 4.0, and `TRUNCATE TABLE' is faster.)

   * You will get an error if you have an active `LOCK TABLES' or
     transaction when trying to execute `TRUNCATE TABLE' or `DROP
     DATABASE'.

   * You should use integers to store values in `BIGINT' columns
     (instead of using strings, as you did in MySQL 3.23).  Using
     strings will still work, but using integers is more efficient.

   * The format of `SHOW OPEN TABLES' has changed.

   * Multi-threaded clients should use `mysql_thread_init()' and
     `mysql_thread_end()'. *Note Threaded clients::.

   * If you want to recompile the Perl `DBD::mysql' module, use a recent
     version.  Version 2.9003 is recommended. Versions older than
     1.2218 should not be used because they use the deprecated
     `mysql_drop_db()' call.

   * `RAND(seed)' returns a different random number series in 4.0 than
     in 3.23; this was done to further differentiate `RAND(seed)' and
     `RAND(seed+1)'.

   * The default type returned by `IFNULL(A,B)' is now set to be the
     more 'general' of the types of `A' and `B'. (The
     general-to-specific order is string, `REAL' or `INTEGER').



Upgrading from Version 3.22 to 3.23
-----------------------------------

MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new `MyISAM' type and the old
`ISAM' type.  You don't have to convert your old tables to use these
with Version 3.23.  By default, all new tables will be created with
type `MyISAM' (unless you start `mysqld' with the
`--default-table-type=isam' option). You can convert an `ISAM' table to
`MyISAM' format with `ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM' or the Perl
script `mysql_convert_table_format'.

Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a
Version 3.23 server.

The following list tells what you have to watch out for when upgrading
to Version 3.23:

   * All tables that use the `tis620' character set must be fixed with
     `myisamchk -r' or `REPAIR TABLE'.

   * If you do a `DROP DATABASE' on a symbolically linked database,
     both the link and the original database are deleted.  (This didn't
     happen in 3.22 because `configure' didn't detect the availability
     of the `readlink()' system call.)

   * `OPTIMIZE TABLE' now works only for `MyISAM' tables.  For other
     table types, you can use `ALTER TABLE' to optimize the table.
     During `OPTIMIZE TABLE', the table is now locked to prevent it
     from being used by other threads.

   * The MySQL client `mysql' is now by default started with the option
     `--no-named-commands (-g)'. This option can be disabled with
     `--enable-named-commands (-G)'. This may cause incompatibility
     problems in some cases--for example, in SQL scripts that use named
     commands without a semicolon.  Long format commands still work
     from the first line.

   * Date functions that work on parts of dates (like `MONTH()') will
     now return 0 for `0000-00-00' dates. (In MySQL 3.22, these
     functions returned `NULL'.)

   * If you are using the `german' character sort order for `ISAM'
     tables, you must repair them with `isamchk -r', because we have
     made some changes in the sort order.

   * The default return type of `IF()' now depends on both arguments
     and not only the first argument.

   * `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns should not be used to store negative
     numbers. The reason for this is that negative numbers caused
     problems when wrapping from -1 to 0.  You should not store 0 in
     `AUTO_INCREMENT' columns, either; `CHECK TABLE' will complain
     about 0 values because they may change if you dump and restore the
     table.  `AUTO_INCREMENT' for `MyISAM' tables is now handled at a
     lower level and is much faster than before. In addition, for
     `MyISAM' tables, old numbers are no longer reused, even if you
     delete rows from the table.

   * `CASE', `DELAYED', `ELSE', `END', `FULLTEXT', `INNER', `RIGHT',
     `THEN', and `WHEN' are now reserved words.

   * `FLOAT(X)' is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a
     fixed number of decimals.

   * When declaring columns using a `DECIMAL(length,dec)' type, the
     `length' argument no longer includes a place for the sign or the
     decimal point.

   * A `TIME' string must now be of one of the following formats:
     `[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]' or
     `[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]'.

   * `LIKE' now compares strings using the same character comparison
     rules as for the `=' operator.  If you require the old behavior,
     you can compile MySQL with the `CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER' flag.

   * `REGEXP' is now case-insensitive if neither of the strings are
     binary strings.

   * When you check or repair `MyISAM' (`.MYI') tables, you should use
     the `CHECK TABLE' statement or the `myisamchk' command. For `ISAM'
     (`.ISM') tables, use the `isamchk' command.

   * If you want your `mysqldump' files to be compatible between MySQL
     Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the `--opt' or
     `--all' option to `mysqldump'.

   * Check all your calls to `DATE_FORMAT()' to make sure there is a
     `%' before each format character.  (MySQL Version 3.22 and later
     already allowed this syntax.)

   * `mysql_fetch_fields_direct()' is now a function (it used to be a
     macro) and it returns a pointer to a `MYSQL_FIELD' instead of a
     `MYSQL_FIELD'.

   * `mysql_num_fields()' can no longer be used on a `MYSQL*' object
     (it's now a function that takes a `MYSQL_RES*' value as an
     argument). With a `MYSQL*' object, you should now use
     `mysql_field_count()' instead.

   * In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of `SELECT DISTINCT ...' was
     almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use `GROUP BY' or
     `ORDER BY' to obtain sorted output.

   * `SUM()' now returns `NULL' instead of 0 if there are no matching
     rows. This is required by SQL-99.

   * An `AND' or `OR' with `NULL' values will now return `NULL' instead
     of 0. This mostly affects queries that use `NOT' on an `AND/OR'
     expression as `NOT NULL' = `NULL'.

   * `LPAD()' and `RPAD()' now shorten the result string if it's longer
     than the length argument.


Upgrading from Version 3.21 to 3.22
-----------------------------------

Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between versions 3.21
and 3.22.  The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with
`DATE' type columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't
access these new columns from an old version of `mysqld'.

After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the `GRANT' command.  If you forget
this, you will get `Access denied' when you try to use `ALTER TABLE',
`CREATE INDEX', or `DROP INDEX'. The procedure for updating the grant
tables is described in *Note Upgrading-grant-tables::.

The C API interface to `mysql_real_connect()' has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a `0' for
the new `db' argument (or recode the client to send the `db' element
for faster connections).  You must also call `mysql_init()' before
calling `mysql_real_connect()'.  This change was done to allow the new
`mysql_options()' function to save options in the `MYSQL' handler
structure.

The `mysqld' variable `key_buffer' has been renamed to
`key_buffer_size', but you can still use the old name in your startup
files.


Upgrading from Version 3.20 to 3.21
-----------------------------------

If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

You can start the `mysqld' Version 3.21 server with the
`--old-protocol' option to use it with clients from a Version 3.20
distribution.  In this case, the new client function `mysql_errno()'
will not return any server error, only `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR' (but it works
for client errors), and the server uses the old pre-3.21 `password()'
checking rather than the new method.

If you are *not* using the `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld', you
will need to make the following changes:

   * All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you
     must get the new `MyODBC' 2.x driver.

   * The script `scripts/add_long_password' must be run to convert the
     `Password' field in the `mysql.user' table to `CHAR(16)'.

   * All passwords must be reassigned in the `mysql.user' table (to get
     62-bit rather than 31-bit passwords).

   * The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any
     tables.


MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new `user' table format
without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier than
Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert
the `user' table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least
Version 3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

The new client code works with a 3.20.x `mysqld' server, so if you
experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

If you are not using the `--old-protocol' option to `mysqld', old
clients will be unable to connect and will issue the following error
message:

     ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9

The Perl DBI interface also supports the old `mysqlperl' interface.
The only change you have to make if you use `mysqlperl' is to change
the arguments to the `connect()' function.  The new arguments are:
`host', `database', `user', and `password' (note that the `user' and
`password' arguments have changed places).

The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

   * `HAVING' must now be specified before any `ORDER BY' clause.

   * The parameters to `LOCATE()' have been swapped.

   * There are some new reserved words. The most notable are `DATE',
     `TIME', and `TIMESTAMP'.



Upgrading MySQL under Windows
-----------------------------

When upgrading MySQL under Windows, please follow these steps:

  1. Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL.

  2. Choose a time of day with low usage, where a maintenance break is
     acceptable.

  3. Alert the users that still are active about the maintenance break.

  4. Stop the running MySQL Server (for example, with `NET STOP MySQL'
     or with the `Services' utility if you are running MySQL as a
     service, or with `mysqladmin shutdown' otherwise).

  5. Exit the `WinMySQLAdmin' program if it is running.

  6. Run the installation script of the Windows distribution, by
     clicking the "Install" button in WinZip and following the
     installation steps of the script.

     *Important note:* Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1
     do not contain any installer program.  See *Note Windows binary
     installation:: for instructions on how to install such a
     distribution.

  7. You may either overwrite your old MySQL installation (usually
     located at `C:\mysql'), or install it into a different directory,
     such as `C:\mysql4'. Overwriting the old installation is
     recommended.

  8. Restart the server (for example, with `NET START MySQL' if you run
     MySQL as a service, or by invoking `mysqld' directly otherwise).

  9. Update the grant tables. The procedure is described in *Note
     Upgrading-grant-tables::.


Possible error situations:
     A system error has occurred.
     System error 1067 has occurred.
     The process terminated unexpectedly.

This error means that your `my.cnf' file (by default `C:\my.cnf')
contains an option that cannot be recognized by MySQL. You can verify
that this is the case by trying to restart MySQL with the `my.cnf' file
renamed, for example, to `my_cnf.old' to prevent the server from using
it.  Once you have verified it, you need to identify which option is
the culprit. Create a new `my.cnf' file and move parts of the old file
to it (restarting the server after you move each part) until you
determine which option causes server startup to fail.


Upgrading the Grant Tables
--------------------------

Some releases introduce changes to the structure of the grant tables
(the tables in the `mysql' database) to add new  privileges or
features. To make sure that your grant tables are current when you
update to a new version of MySQL, you should update your grant tables
as well.

On Unix or Unix-like systems, update the grant tables by running the
`mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script:

     shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables

You must run this script while the server is running. It attempts to
connect to the server running on the local host as `root'.  If your
`root' account requires a password, indicate the password on the
command line.  For MySQL 4.1 and up, specify the password like this:

     shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables --password=root_password

Prior to MySQL 4.1, specify the password like this:

     shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables root_password

The `mysql_fix_privilege_tables' script performs any actions necessary
to convert your grant tables to the current format. You may see some
`Duplicate column name' warnings as it runs; they can be ignored.

After running the script, stop the server and restart it.

On Windows systems, there isn't an easy way to update the grant tables
until MySQL 4.0.15.  From version 4.0.15 on, MySQL distributions
include a `mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql' SQL script that you can run
using the `mysql' client.  If your MySQL installation is located at
`C:\mysql', the commands look like this:

     C:\mysql\bin> mysql -u root -p mysql
     
     mysql> SOURCE C:\mysql\scripts\mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql

If your installation is located in some other directory, adjust the
pathnames appropriately.

The `mysql' command will prompt you for the `root' password; enter it
when prompted.

As with the Unix procedure, you may see some `Duplicate column name'
warnings as `mysql' processes the statements in the
`mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql' script; they can be ignored.

After running the script, stop the server and restart it.


Copying MySQL Databases to Another Machine
------------------------------------------

If you are using MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can copy the `.frm',
`.MYI', and `.MYD' files for `MyISAM' tables between different
architectures that support the same floating-point format.  (MySQL
takes care of any byte-swapping issues.)  *Note `MyISAM' Tables: MyISAM.

The MySQL `ISAM' data and index files (`.ISD' and `*.ISM',
respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases operating
system-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another
machine that has a different architecture or operating system than your
current machine, you should not try to move a database by simply copying
the files to the other machine. Use `mysqldump' instead.

By default, `mysqldump' will create a file containing SQL statements.
You can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input
to the `mysql' client.

Try `mysqldump --help' to see what options are available.  If you are
moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use `mysqldump
--opt' to take advantage of any optimizations that result in a dump
file that is smaller and can be processed faster.

The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between
two machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which
the database is located:

     shell> mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
     shell> mysqldump --opt db_name \
             | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name

If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow
network, you can use:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name
     shell> mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
             | mysql db_name

You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

     shell> mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip > db_name.contents.gz

(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these
commands there:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name
     shell> gunzip < db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name

You can also use `mysqldump' and `mysqlimport' to transfer the database.
For big tables, this is much faster than simply using `mysqldump'.  In
the following commands, `DUMPDIR' represents the full pathname of the
directory you use to store the output from `mysqldump'.

First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

     shell> mkdir DUMPDIR
     shell> mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name

Then transfer the files in the `DUMPDIR' directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL there:

     shell> mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
     shell> cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
     shell> mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables

Also, don't forget to copy the `mysql' database because that's where the
grant tables (`user', `db', `host') are stored.  You may have to run
commands as the MySQL `root' user on the new machine until you have the
`mysql' database in place.

After you import the `mysql' database on the new machine, execute
`mysqladmin flush-privileges' so that the server reloads the grant table
information.

Linux Operating System Notes
............................

MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

*Warning:* We have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and
MySQL on SMP systems.  We also have reports from some MySQL users that
they have encountered serious stability problems using MySQL with
kernel 2.2.14.  If you are using this kernel, you should upgrade to
2.2.19 (or newer) or to a 2.4 kernel.  If you have a multiple-CPU box,
then you should seriously consider using 2.4 as this will give you a
significant speed boost.  Your system also will be more stable.

When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three `mysqld'
processes running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one
thread for the LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections,
and one thread to handle alarms and signals.


Linux Binary Distribution Notes
...............................

The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured for the
highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest stable
compiler available.

The binary release is linked with `-static', which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
`-static' is slightly larger than a dynamically linked program, but
also slightly faster (3-5%).  However, one problem with a statically
linked program is that you can't use user-defined functions (UDFs).  If
you are going to write or use UDFs (this is something for C or C++
programmers only), you must compile MySQL yourself using dynamic
linking.

A known issue with binary distributions is that on older Linux systems
that use `libc' (such as Red Hat 4.x or Slackware), you will get some
non-fatal problems with hostname resolution. If your system uses `libc'
rather than `glibc2', you probably will encounter some difficulties
with hostname resolution and `getpwnam()'. This happens because `glibc'
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to implement hostname
resolution and `getpwent()', even when compiled with `-static').  These
problems manifest themselves in two ways:

   * You probably will see  the following error message when you run
     `mysql_install_db':

          Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up

     You can deal with this by executing `mysql_install_db --force',
     which will not execute the `resolveip' test in `mysql_install_db'.
     The downside is that you can't use hostnames in the grant tables:
     Except for `localhost', you must use IP numbers instead.  If you
     are using an old version of MySQL that doesn't support `--force',
     you must manually remove the `resolveip' test in `mysql_install'
     using an editor.

   * You also may see the following error when you try to run `mysqld'
     with the `--user' option:

          getpwnam: No such file or directory

     To work around this, start `mysqld' with `su' rather than by
     specifying the `--user' option. This causes the system itself to
     change the user ID of the `mysqld' process so that `mysqld' need
     not do so.


Another solution, which solves both problems, is to not use a binary
distribution.  Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the `tar.gz'
distribution) and install that instead.

On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error `Resource temporarily
unavailable' when clients make a lot of new connections to a `mysqld'
server over TCP/IP.  The problem is that Linux has a delay between the
time that you close a TCP/IP socket and the time that the system
actually frees it.  There is only room for a finite number of TCP/IP
slots, so you will encounter the resource-unavailable error if clients
attempt too many new TCP/IP connections during a short time. For
example, you may see the error when you run the MySQL `test-connect'
benchmark over TCP/IP.

We have inquired about this problem a few times on different Linux
mailing lists but have never been able to find a suitable resolution.
The only known "fix" is for the clients to use persistent connections,
or, if you are running the database server and clients on the same
machine, to use Unix socket file connections rather than TCP/IP
connections.


Linux Source Distribution Notes
...............................

The following notes regarding `glibc' apply only to the situation when
you build MySQL yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine,
in most cases it is much better for you to just use our binary. We link
our binaries against the best patched version of `glibc' we can come up
with and with the best compiler options, in an attempt to make it
suitable for a high-load server.  For a typical user, even for setups
with a lot of concurrent connections or tables exceeding the 2G limit,
our binary is the best choice in most cases.  After reading the
following text, if you are in doubt about what to do, try our binary
first to see whether it meets your needs.  If you discover that our
binary is not good enough, then you may want to try your own build.  In
that case, we would appreciate a note about it, so we can build a
better binary next time.

MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old Linux
version that doesn't have `glibc2', you must install LinuxThreads
before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get LinuxThreads at
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html'.

Note that `glibc' versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have a
fatal bug in `pthread_mutex_timedwait()' handling, which is used when
you issue `INSERT DELAYED' statements.  We recommend that you not use
`INSERT DELAYED' before upgrading `glibc'.

Note that Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default only
have 1024 threads.  If you plan to have more than 1000 concurrent
connections, you will need to make some changes to LinuxThreads:

   * Increase `PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX' in
     `sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h' to 4096 and decrease
     `STACK_SIZE' in `linuxthreads/internals.h' to 256 KB. The paths
     are relative to the root of `glibc'. (Note that MySQL will not be
     stable with around 600-1000 connections if `STACK_SIZE' is the
     default of 2 MB.)

   * Recompile LinuxThreads to produce a new `libpthread.a' library,
     and relink MySQL against it.


The page `http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html' contains additional
information about circumventing thread limits in LinuxThreads.

There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance, especially
on SMP systems.  The mutex implementation in LinuxThreads in `glibc'
2.1 is very bad for programs with many threads that hold the mutex only
for a short time.  This produces a paradoxical result: If you link
MySQL against an unmodified LinuxThreads, removing processors from an
SMP actually improves MySQL performance in many cases.  We have made a
patch available for `glibc' 2.1.3 to correct this behavior
(`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch').

With `glibc' 2.2.2, MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex,
which is much better than even the patched one in `glibc' 2.1.3. Be
warned, however, that under some conditions, the current mutex code in
`glibc' 2.2.2 overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The likelihood
that this condition will occur can be reduced by renicing the `mysqld'
process to the highest priority. We have also been able to correct the
overspin behavior with a patch, available at
`http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch'.  It
combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of threads, and
stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
`linuxthreads' directory with `patch -p0
</tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch'.  We hope it will be included in some
form in future releases of `glibc' 2.2. In any case, if you link
against `glibc' 2.2.2, you still need to correct `STACK_SIZE' and
`PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX'. We hope that the defaults will be corrected to
some more acceptable values for high-load MySQL setup in the future, so
that the commands needed to produce your own build can be reduced to
`./configure; make; make install'.

We recommend that you use the above patches to build a special static
version of `libpthread.a' and use it only for statically linking
against MySQL. We know that the patches are safe for MySQL and
significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything about
other applications. If you link other applications that require
LinuxThreads against the patched static version of the library, or
build a patched shared version and install it on your system, you are
doing it at your own risk.

If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilities hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using
our binary will resolve them.

If you link your own MySQL client programs, you may see the following
error at runtime:

     ld.so.1: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
     open failed: No such file or directory

This problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

   * Link clients with the `-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so' flag
     rather than with `-Lpath').

   * Copy `libmysqclient.so' to `/usr/lib'.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable before running
     your client.

If you are using the Fujitsu compiler (`fcc/FCC'), you will have some
problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very `gcc'
oriented.  The following `configure' line should work with `fcc/FCC':

     CC=fcc CFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib -K omitfp -Kpreex -D_GNU_SOURCE \
         -DCONST=const -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO" \
     CXX=FCC CXXFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib \
         -K omitfp -K preex --no_exceptions --no_rtti -D_GNU_SOURCE \
         -DCONST=const -Dalloca=__builtin_alloca -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO \
         '-D_EXTERN_INLINE=static __inline'" \
     ./configure \
         --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
         --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static --disable-shared \
         --with-low-memory


Linux Post-installation Notes
.............................

`mysql.server' can be found in the `share/mysql' directory under the
MySQL installation directory or in the `support-files' directory of the
MySQL source tree.  You can install it as `/etc/init.d/mysql' for
automatic MySQL startup and shutdown.  *Note Automatic start::.

If MySQL can't open enough files or connections, it may be that you
haven't configured Linux to handle enough files.

In Linux 2.2 and onward, you can check the number of allocated file
handles as follows:

     shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
     shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
     shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max

If you have more than 16 MB of memory, you should add something like the
following to your init scripts (for example, `/etc/init.d/boot.local'
on SuSE Linux):

     echo 65536 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
     echo 8192 > /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
     echo 1024 > /proc/sys/fs/super-max

You can also run the `echo' commands from the command line as `root',
but these settings will be lost the next time your computer reboots.

Alternatively, you can set these parameters on bootup by using the
`sysctl' tool, which is used by many Linux distributions (SuSE has
added it as well, beginning with SuSE Linux 8.0). Just put the following
values into a file named `/etc/sysctl.conf':

     # Increase some values for MySQL
     fs.file-max = 65536
     fs.dquot-max = 8192
     fs.super-max = 1024

You should also add the following to `/etc/my.cnf':

     [mysqld_safe]
     open-files-limit=8192

This should allow the server a limit of 8192 for the combined number of
connections and open files.

The `STACK_SIZE' constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there
will be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but
small enough to keep the stack of some threads from running into the
global `mysqld' data.  Unfortunately, as we have experimentally
discovered, the Linux implementation of `mmap()' will successfully
unmap an already mapped region if you ask it to map out an address
already in use, zeroing out the data on the entire page, instead of
returning an error.  So, the safety of `mysqld' or any other threaded
application depends on "gentlemanly" behavior of the code that creates
threads.  The user must take measures to make sure the number of
running threads at any time is sufficiently low for thread stacks to
stay away from the global heap.  With `mysqld', you should enforce this
behavior by setting a reasonable value for the `max_connections'
variable.

If you build MySQL yourself, you can patch LinuxThreads for better
stack use.  *Note Source notes-Linux::.  If you do not want to patch
LinuxThreads, you should set `max_connections' to a value no higher
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large
heap tables, or some other things that make `mysqld' allocate a lot of
memory, or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2G patch. If you are
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
`max_connections' at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables
with lots of data.  The more you reduce `STACK_SIZE' in LinuxThreads
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend values between
128K and 256K.

If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a
"feature" in the 2.2 kernel that attempts to prevent fork bomb attacks
by penalizing a process for forking or cloning a child.  This causes
MySQL not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent
clients.  On single-CPU systems, we have seen this manifested as very
slow thread creation: It may take a long time to connect to MySQL (as
long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it down.  On
multiple-CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in query speed as
the number of clients increases.  In the process of trying to find a
solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of our users who
claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The patch is
available at `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch'.
We have now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both
development and production systems.  It has significantly improved
MySQL performance without causing any problems and we now recommend it
to our users who still run high-load servers on 2.2 kernels.

This issue has been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not satisfied
with the current performance of your system, rather than patching your
2.2 kernel, it might be easier to upgrade to 2.4. On SMP systems,
upgrading also will give you a nice SMP boost in addition to fixing the
fairness bug.

We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2-CPU machine and found
MySQL scales *much* better. There was virtually no slowdown on query
throughput all the way up to 1000 clients, and the MySQL scaling factor
(computed as the ratio of maximum throughput to the throughput for one
client) was 180%.  We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system:
Virtually no slowdown as the number of clients was increased up to 1000,
and a 300% scaling factor. Based on these results, for a high-load SMP
server using a 2.2 kernel, we definitely recommend upgrading to the 2.4
kernel at this point.

We have discovered that it is essential to run `mysqld' process with
the highest possible priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum
performance.  This can be done by adding a `renice -20 $$' command to
`mysqld_safe'. In our testing on a 4-CPU machine, increasing the
priority gave 60% throughput increase with 400 clients.

We are currently also trying to collect more information on how well
MySQL performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way systems. If you have
access such a system and have done some benchmarks, please send an email
message to <benchmarks@mysql.com> with the results. We will review them
for inclusion in the manual.

If you see a dead `mysqld' server process with `ps', this usually means
that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted table. *Note
Crashing::.

To get a core dump on Linux if `mysqld' dies with a `SIGSEGV' signal,
you can start `mysqld' with the `--core-file' option.  Note that you
also probably need to raise the `core file size' by adding `ulimit -c
1000000' to `mysqld_safe' or starting `mysqld_safe' with
`--core-file-size=1000000'.  *Note `mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe.


Linux x86 Notes
...............

MySQL requires `libc' Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to work with
`libc' 5.4.46.  `glibc' Version 2.0.6 and later should also work. There
have been some problems with the `glibc' RPMs from Red Hat, so if you
have problems, check whether there are any updates.  The `glibc'
2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

If you are using Red Hat 8.0 or a new `glibc' 2.2.x library, you may see
`mysqld' die in `gethostbyaddr()'. This happens because the new `glibc'
library requires a stack size greater than 128K for this call.  To fix
the problem, start `mysqld' with the `--thread-stack=192K' option.
(Use `-O thread_stack=192K' before MySQL 4.)  This stack size is now
the default on MySQL 4.0.10 and above, so you should not see the
problem.

If you are using `gcc' 3.0 and above to compile MySQL, you must install
the `libstdc++v3' library before compiling MySQL; if you don't do this,
you will get an error about a missing `__cxa_pure_virtual' symbol
during linking.

On some older Linux distributions, `configure' may produce an error
like this:

     Syntax error in sched.h. Change _P to __P in the
     /usr/include/sched.h file.
     See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.

Just do what the error message says. Add an extra underscore to the
`_P' macro name that has only one underscore, then try again.

You may get some warnings when compiling. Those shown here can be
ignored:

     mysqld.cc -o objs-thread/mysqld.o
     mysqld.cc: In function `void init_signals()':
     mysqld.cc:315: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
     `long unsigned int'
     mysqld.cc: In function `void * signal_hand(void *)':
     mysqld.cc:346: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
     `long unsigned int'

If `mysqld' always dumps core when it starts, the problem may be that
you have an old `/lib/libc.a'.  Try renaming it, then remove
`sql/mysqld' and do a new `make install' and try again.  This problem
has been reported on some Slackware installations.

If you get the following error when linking `mysqld', it means that
your `libg++.a' is not installed correctly:

     /usr/lib/libc.a(putc.o): In function `_IO_putc':
     putc.o(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `_IO_putc'

You can avoid using `libg++.a' by running `configure' like this:

     shell> CXX=gcc ./configure


Linux SPARC Notes
.................

In some implementations, `readdir_r()' is broken.  The symptom is that
the `SHOW DATABASES' statement always returns an empty set.  This can
be fixed by removing `HAVE_READDIR_R' from `config.h' after configuring
and before compiling.


Linux Alpha Notes
.................

MySQL Version 3.23.12 is the first MySQL version that is tested on
Linux-Alpha.  If you plan to use MySQL on Linux-Alpha, you should
ensure that you have this version or newer.

We have tested MySQL on Alpha with our benchmarks and test suite, and
it appears to work nicely.

We currently build the MySQL binary packages on SuSE Linux 7.0 for AXP,
kernel 2.4.4-SMP, Compaq C compiler (V6.2-505) and Compaq C++ compiler
(V6.3-006) on a Compaq DS20 machine with an Alpha EV6 processor.

You can find the above compilers at
`http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/'.  By using these compilers
rather than `gcc', we get about 9-14% better MySQL performance.

Note that until MySQL version 3.23.52 and 4.0.2, we optimized the
binary for the current CPU only (by using the `-fast' compile option).
This means that for older versions, you can use our Alpha binaries only
if you have an Alpha EV6 processor.

For all following releases, we added the `-arch generic' flag to our
compile options, which makes sure the binary runs on all Alpha
processors. We also compile statically to avoid library problems.  The
`configure' command looks like this:

     CC=ccc CFLAGS="-fast -arch generic" CXX=cxx \
     CXXFLAGS="-fast -arch generic -noexceptions -nortti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared \
         --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client \
         --with-mysqld-ldflags=-non_shared --with-client-ldflags=-non_shared

If you want to use `egcs', the following `configure' line worked for us:

     CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
         -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

   * Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with `gdb
     4.18'.  You should use `gdb' 5.1 instead!

   * If you try linking `mysqld' statically when using `gcc', the
     resulting image will dump core at startup time.  In other words,
     *don't* use `--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static' with `gcc'.


Linux PowerPC Notes
...................

MySQL should work on MkLinux with the newest `glibc' package (tested
with `glibc' 2.0.7).


Linux MIPS Notes
................

To get MySQL to work on Qube2 (Linux Mips), you need the newest `glibc'
libraries. `glibc-2.0.7-29C2' is known to work.  You must also use the
`egcs' C++ compiler (`egcs-1.0.2-9', `gcc 2.95.2' or newer).


Linux IA-64 Notes
.................

To get MySQL to compile on Linux IA-64, we use the following `configure'
command for building with `gcc' 2.96:

     CC=gcc \
     CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
     CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
         -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
         "--with-comment=Official MySQL binary" \
         --with-extra-charsets=complex

On IA-64, the MySQL client binaries use shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution at a location other than
`/usr/local/mysql', you need to add the path of the directory where you
have `libmysqlclient.so' installed either to the `/etc/ld.so.conf' file
or to the value of your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.

*Note Link errors::.


Mac OS X Notes
--------------

On Mac OS X, `tar' cannot handle long filenames. If you need to unpack a
`.tar.gz' distribution, use `gnutar' instead.

* Menu:

* Mac OS X 10.x::               Mac OS X 10.x (Darwin)
* Mac OS X Server::             Mac OS X Server 1.2 (Rhapsody)


Mac OS X 10.x (Darwin)
......................

MySQL should work without any problems on Mac OS X 10.x (Darwin).

Our binary for Mac OS X is compiled on Darwin 6.3 with the following
`configure' line:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
         -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
         --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client \
         --enable-local-infile --disable-shared

*Note Mac OS X installation::.


Mac OS X Server 1.2 (Rhapsody)
..............................

For current versions of Mac OS X Server, no operating system changes are
necessary before compiling MySQL.  Compiling for the Server platform is
the same as for the client version of Mac OS X. (However, note that
MySQL comes preinstalled on Mac OS X Server, so you need not build it
yourself.)

For older versions (Mac OS X Server 1.2, a.k.a. Rhapsody), you must
first install a pthread package before trying to configure MySQL.

*Note Mac OS X installation::.


Solaris Notes
-------------

On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris `tar' can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

     x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,\
     informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
     tar: directory checksum error

In this case, you must use GNU `tar' (`gtar') to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
`http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html'.

Sun native threads only work on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version
2.4 and earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.  *Note
MIT-pthreads::.

If you get the following error from `configure', it means that you have
something wrong with your compiler installation:

     checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not
     run test programs while cross compiling

In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer version.  You
may also be able to solve this problem by inserting the following row
into the `config.cache' file:

     ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=${ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'}

If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is `gcc'
2.95.2 or 3.2. You can find this at `http://gcc.gnu.org/'.  Note that
`egcs' 1.1.1 and `gcc' 2.8.1 don't work reliably on SPARC!

The recommended `configure' line when using `gcc' 2.95.2 is:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
     CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory \
     --enable-assembler

If you have an UltraSPARC system, you can get 4% better performance by
adding `-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa' to the `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS'
environment variables.

If you have Sun's Forte 5.0 (or newer) compiler, you can run
`configure' like this:

     CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt" \
     CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler

To create a 64-bit binary with Sun's Forte compiler, use the following
configuration options:

     CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt -xarch=v9" \
     CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt -xarch=v9" ASFLAGS="-xarch=v9" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler

To create a 64bit Solaris binary using `gcc', add `-m64' to `CFLAGS'
and `CXXFLAGS'. Note that this works only with MySQL 4.0 and up - MySQL
3.23 does not include the required modifications to support this.

In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 4% speedup on an UltraSPARC when using
Forte 5.0 in 32-bit mode compared to using `gcc' 3.2 with `-mcpu' flags.

If you create a 64-bit `mysqld' binary, it is 4% slower than the 32-bit
binary, but can handle more threads and memory.

If you get a problem with `fdatasync' or `sched_yield', you can fix
this by adding `LIBS=-lrt' to the configure line

For older compilers than WorkShop 5.3, you may have to edit the
`configure' script to change this line:

     #if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1

To this:

     #if !defined(__STDC__)

If you turn on `__STDC__' with the `-Xc' option, the Sun compiler can't
compile with the Solaris `pthread.h' header file.  This is a Sun bug
(broken compiler or broken include file).

If `mysqld' issues the following error message when you run it, you have
tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (`-mt'):

     libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held

Add `-mt' to `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS' and recompile.

If you are using the SFW version of `gcc' (which comes with Solaris 8),
you must add `/opt/sfw/lib' to the environment variable
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' before running `configure'.

If you are using the `gcc' available from `sunfreeware.com', you may
have many problems.  To avoid this, you should recompile `gcc' and GNU
`binutils' on the machine where you will be running them.

If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with `gcc', it
means that your `gcc' is not configured for your version of Solaris:

     shell> gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
     ./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
     ./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'

The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
`gcc' and compile it with your current `gcc' compiler!  At least for
Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of `gcc' have old, unusable
include files that will break all programs that use threads, and
possibly other programs!

Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(`libpthreads' and `libdl'), so you can't compile MySQL with
`--static'.  If you try to do so, you will get one of the following
errors:

     ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found
     undefined reference to `dlopen'
     cannot find -lrt

If you link your own MySQL client programs, you may see the following
error at runtime:

     ld.so.1: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
     open failed: No such file or directory

This problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

   * Link clients with the `-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so' flag
     rather than with `-Lpath').

   * Copy `libmysqclient.so' to `/usr/lib'.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable before running
     your client.

If you have problems with `configure' trying to link with `-lz' when
you don't have `zlib' installed, you have two options:

   * If you want to be able to use the compressed communication
     protocol, you need to get and install `zlib' from `ftp.gnu.org'.

   * Run `configure' with the `--with-named-z-libs=no' option when
     building MySQL.

If you are using `gcc' and have problems with loading user-defined
functions (UDFs) into MySQL, try adding `-lgcc' to the link line for
the UDF.

If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
`support-files/mysql.server' to `/etc/init.d' and create a symbolic
link to it named `/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server'.

If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to `mysqld', you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

     Error in accept: Protocol error

You might try starting the server with the `--back_log=50' option as a
workaround for this.  (Use `-O back_log=50' before MySQL 4.)

Solaris doesn't support core files for `setuid()' applications, so you
can't get a core file from `mysqld' if you are using the `--user'
option.

Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes
.....................

You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to detect new versions of
Solaris automatically and enable workarounds for the following problems!

Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use `gcc':

     /usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
     /usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
     definition

If this occurs, you can fix the problem by copying
`/usr/include/widec.h' to `.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include' and
changing line 41 from this:

     #if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint)

To this:

     #if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint) && !defined(getwc)

Alternatively, you can edit `/usr/include/widec.h' directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove `config.cache' and run
`configure' again!

If you get the following errors when you run `make', it's because
`configure' didn't detect the `curses.h' file (probably because of the
error in `/usr/include/widec.h'):

     In file included from mysql.cc:50:
     /usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
     /usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'

The solution to this is to do one of the following:

   * Configure with `CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H
     ./configure'.

   * Edit `/usr/include/widec.h' as indicated above and re-run
     `configure'.

   * Remove the `#define HAVE_TERM' line from the `config.h' file and
     run `make' again.

If your linker can't find `-lz' when linking client programs, the
problem is probably that your `libz.so' file is installed in
`/usr/local/lib'.  You can fix this by one of the following methods:

   * Add `/usr/local/lib' to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH'.

   * Add a link to `libz.so' from `/lib'.

   * If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional `zlib'
     from your Solaris 8 CD distribution.

   * Run `configure' with the `--with-named-z-libs=no' option when
     building MySQL.


Solaris x86 Notes
.................

On Solaris 8 on x86, `mysqld' will dump core if you remove the debug
symbols using `strip'.

If you are using `gcc' or `egcs' on Solaris x86 and you experience
problems with core dumps under load, you should use the following
`configure' command:

     CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
     CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
         -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

This will avoid problems with the `libstdc++' library and with C++
exceptions.

If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run it
with a trace file or under `gdb'.  *Note Using `gdb' on `mysqld': Using
gdb on mysqld.

FreeBSD Notes
.............

FreeBSD 4.x or newer is recommended for running MySQL, because the
thread package is much more integrated.  To get a secure and stable
system, you should use only FreeBSD kernels that are marked `-RELEASE'.

The easiest (and preferred) way to install MySQL is to use the
`mysql-server' and `mysql-client' ports available at
`http://www.freebsd.org/'.  Using these ports gives you the following
benefits:

   * A working MySQL with all optimizations enabled that are known to
     work on your version of FreeBSD.

   * Automatic configuration and build.

   * Startup scripts installed in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d'.

   * The ability to use `pkg_info -L' to see which files are installed.

   * The ability to use `pkg_delete' to remove MySQL if you no longer
     want it on your machine.

It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x, and native
threads on Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with native threads
on some late 2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems shutting
down `mysqld'.

Unfortunately, certain function calls on FreeBSD are not yet fully
thread-safe.  Most notably, this includes the `gethostbyname()'
function, which is used by MySQL to convert hostnames into IP
addresses. Under certain circumstances, the `mysqld' process will
suddenly cause 100% CPU load and will be unresponsive. If you encounter
this problem, try to start up MySQL using the `--skip-name-resolve'
option.

Alternatively, you can link MySQL on FreeBSD 4.x against the
LinuxThreads library, which avoids a few of the problems that the
native FreeBSD thread implementation has. For a very good comparison of
LinuxThreads vs. native threads, see Jeremy Zawodny's article `FreeBSD
or Linux for your MySQL Server?' at
`http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000697.html'.

A known problem when using LinuxThreads on FreeBSD is that
`wait_timeout' is not working (probably a signal handling problem in
FreeBSD/LinuxThreads).  This is supposed to be fixed in FreeBSD 5.0.
The symptom is that persistent connections can hang for a very long
time without getting closed down.

The MySQL build process require GNU make (`gmake') to work.  If GNU
`make' is not available, you must install it first before compiling
MySQL.

The recommended way to compile and install MySQL on FreeBSD with `gcc'
(2.95.2 and up) is:

     shell> CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-strength-reduce" \
                CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions \
                -felide-constructors -fno-strength-reduce" \
                ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
     shell> gmake
     shell> gmake install
     shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
     shell> bin/mysql_install_db
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe &

If you notice that `configure' will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  *Note MIT-pthreads::.

If you get an error from `make install' that it can't find
`/usr/include/pthreads', `configure' didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads. To fix this problem, remove `config.cache', then re-run
`configure' with the `--with-mit-threads' option.

Be sure your name resolver setup is correct.  Otherwise, you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to `mysqld'.
Also make sure that the `localhost' entry in the `/etc/hosts' file is
correct.  The file should start with a line similar to this:

     127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain

FreeBSD is known to have a very low default file handle limit.  *Note
Not enough file handles::.  Start the server by using the
`--open-files-limit' option for `mysqld_safe', or raise the limits for
the `mysqld' user in `/etc/login.conf' and rebuild it with `cap_mkdb
/etc/login.conf'.  Also be sure you set the appropriate class for this
user in the password file if you are not using the default (use `chpass
mysqld-user-name').  *Note `mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe.

If you have a lot of memory, you should consider rebuilding the kernel
to allow MySQL to use more than 512M of RAM.  Take a look at `option
MAXDSIZ' in the LINT config file for more information.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the `TZ'
variable will probably help.  *Note Environment variables::.


NetBSD Notes
............

To compile on NetBSD you need GNU `make'. Otherwise, the build process
will fail when `make' tries to run `lint' on C++ files.


OpenBSD 2.5 Notes
.................

On OpenBSD Version 2.5, you can compile MySQL with native threads with
the following options:

     CFLAGS=-pthread CXXFLAGS=-pthread ./configure --with-mit-threads=no


OpenBSD 2.8 Notes
.................

Our users have reported that OpenBSD 2.8 has a threading bug which
causes problems with MySQL.  The OpenBSD Developers have fixed the
problem, but as of January 25th, 2001, it's only available in the
"-current" branch.  The symptoms of this threading bug are: slow
response, high load, high CPU usage, and crashes.

If you get an error like `Error in accept:: Bad file descriptor' or
error 9 when trying to open tables or directories, the problem is
probably that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for MySQL.

In this case, try starting `mysqld_safe' as `root' with the following
options:

     shell> mysqld_safe --user=mysql --open-files-limit=2048 &


BSD/OS Version 2.x Notes
........................

If you get the following error when compiling MySQL, your `ulimit'
value for virtual memory is too low:

     item_func.h: In method `Item_func_ge::Item_func_ge(const Item_func_ge &)':
     item_func.h:28: virtual memory exhausted
     make[2]: *** [item_func.o] Error 1

Try using `ulimit -v 80000' and run `make' again.  If this doesn't work
and you are using `bash', try switching to `csh' or `sh'; some BSDI
users have reported problems with `bash' and `ulimit'.

If you are using `gcc', you may also use have to use the
`--with-low-memory' flag for `configure' to be able to compile
`sql_yacc.cc'.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the `TZ'
variable will probably help.  *Note Environment variables::.


BSD/OS Version 3.x Notes
........................

Upgrade to BSD/OS Version 3.1.  If that is not possible, install
BSDIpatch M300-038.

Use the following command when configuring MySQL:

     shell> env CXX=shlicc++ CC=shlicc2 \
            ./configure \
                --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
                --without-perl \
                --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock

The following is also known to work:

     shell> env CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
            ./configure \
                --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock

You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
`--skip-thread-priority' option to `mysqld'!  This will run all threads
with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

If you get the error `virtual memory exhausted' while compiling, you
should try using `ulimit -v 80000' and run `make' again.  If this
doesn't work and you are using `bash', try switching to `csh' or `sh';
some BSDI users have reported problems with `bash' and `ulimit'.


BSD/OS Version 4.x Notes
........................

BSDI Version 4.x has some thread-related bugs.  If you want to use
MySQL on this, you should install all thread-related patches.  At least
M400-023 should be installed.

On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared
libraries.  The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs,
for example, `mysqladmin'.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to
use shared libraries with the `--disable-shared' option to configure.

Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the `mysqld' binary
after a while can't open tables.  This is because some library/system
related bug causes `mysqld' to change current directory without asking
for this!

The fix is to either upgrade MySQL to at least version 3.23.34 or, after
running `configure', remove the line `#define HAVE_REALPATH' from
`config.h' before running make.

Note that the above means that you can't symbolic link a database
directories to another database directory or symbolic link a table to
another database on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is
okay).

HP-UX Version 10.20 Notes
.........................

There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on HP-UX.  We
recommend that you use `gcc' instead of the HP-UX native compiler,
because `gcc' produces better code!

We recommend using `gcc' 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimization
flags (like `-O6') as they may not be safe on HP-UX.

The following `configure' line should work with `gcc' 2.95:

     CFLAGS="-I/opt/dce/include -fpic" \
     CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
     -fno-rtti" \
     CXX=gcc \
     ./configure --with-pthread \
         --with-named-thread-libs='-ldce' \
         --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

The following `configure' line should work with `gcc' 3.1:

     CFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -O3 -fPIC" CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors \
         -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3 -fPIC" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
         --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client \
         --enable-local-infile  --with-pthread \
         --with-named-thread-libs=-ldce --with-lib-ccflags=-fPIC
         --disable-shared


HP-UX Version 11.x Notes
........................

For HP-UX Version 11.x, we recommend MySQL Version 3.23.15 or later.

Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you
should install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on
HP-UX 11.0:

     PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
     PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative

This will solve the problem of getting `EWOULDBLOCK' from `recv()' and
`EBADF' from `accept()' in threaded applications.

If you are using `gcc' 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system, you
will get the error:

     In file included from /usr/include/unistd.h:11,
                      from ../include/global.h:125,
                      from mysql_priv.h:15,
                      from item.cc:19:
     /usr/include/sys/unistd.h:184: declaration of C function ...
     /usr/include/sys/pthread.h:440: previous declaration ...
     In file included from item.h:306,
                      from mysql_priv.h:158,
                      from item.cc:19:

The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define `pthreads_atfork()'
consistently.  It has conflicting prototypes in
`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h':184 and `/usr/include/sys/pthread.h':440
(details below).

One solution is to copy `/usr/include/sys/unistd.h' into
`mysql/include' and edit `unistd.h' and change it to match the
definition in `pthread.h'.  Here's the diff:

     183,184c183,184
     <      extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(), void (*parent)(),
     <                                                void (*child)());
     ---
     >      extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(void), void (*parent)(void),
     >                                                void (*child)(void));

After this, the following `configure' line should work:

     CFLAGS="-fomit-frame-pointer -O3 -fpic" CXX=gcc \
     CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

If you are using MySQL 4.0.5 with the HP-UX compiler, you can use the
following command (which has been tested with `cc' B.11.11.04):

     CC=cc CXX=aCC CFLAGS=+DD64 CXXFLAGS=+DD64 ./configure \
         --with-extra-character-set=complex

You can ignore any errors of the following type:

     aCC: warning 901: unknown option: `-3': use +help for online
     documentation

If you get the following error from `configure', check that you don't
have the path to the K&R compiler before the path to the HP-UX C and
C++ compiler:

     checking for cc option to accept ANSI C... no
     configure: error: MySQL requires a ANSI C compiler (and a C++ compiler).
     Try gcc. See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.

Another reason for not being able to compile is that you didn't define
the `+DD64' flags above.

Another possibility for HP-UX 11 is to use MySQL binaries for HP-UX
10.20.  We have received reports from some users that these binaries
work fine on HP-UX 11.00. If you encounter problems, be sure to check
your HP-UX patch level.


IBM-AIX notes
.............

Automatic detection of `xlC' is missing from Autoconf, so a number of
variables need to be set before running `configure'. The following
example uses the IBM compiler:

     export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
     export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
     export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
     export LDFLAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
     export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
     
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                     --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
                     --sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
                     --sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
                     --libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
                     --enable-thread-safe-client \
                     --enable-large-files

Above are the options used to compile the MySQL distribution that can
be found at `http://www-frec.bull.com/'.

If you change the `-O3' to `-O2' in the preceding `configure' line, you
must also remove the `-qstrict' option (this is a limitation in the IBM
C compiler).

If you are using `gcc' or `egcs' to compile MySQL, you *must* use the
`-fno-exceptions' flag, because the exception handling in `gcc'/`egcs'
is not thread-safe!  (This is tested with `egcs' 1.1.)  There are also
some known problems with IBM's assembler that may cause it to generate
bad code when used with `gcc'.

We recommend the following `configure' line with `egcs' and `gcc 2.95'
on AIX:

     CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
     CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
     CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory

The `-Wa,-many' is necessary for the compile to be successful.  IBM is
aware of this problem but is in to hurry to fix it because of the
workaround available.  We don't know if the `-fno-exceptions' is
required with `gcc 2.95', but as MySQL doesn't use exceptions and the
above option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always
use this option with `egcs / gcc'.

If you get a problem with assembler code, try changing the `-mcpu=xxx'
option to match your CPU. Typically `power2', `power', or `powerpc' may
need to be used.  Alternatively, you might need to use `604' or `604e'.
We are not positive but suspect that `power' would likely be safe most
of the time, even on a power2 machine.

If you don't know what your CPU is, execute a `uname -m' command.  It
will produce a string that looks like `000514676700', with a format of
`xxyyyyyymmss' where `xx' and `ss' are always `00', `yyyyyy' is a
unique system ID and `mm' is the ID of the CPU Planar.  A chart of
these values can be found at
`http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm'.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of CPU you have.

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly under high
load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and signals.  In this
case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by configuring with:

     shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
            CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti \
            -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug \
                --with-low-memory

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side effect
that you can't kill clients that are "sleeping" on a connection with
`mysqladmin kill' or `mysqladmin shutdown'.  Instead, the client will
die when it issues its next command.

On some versions of AIX, linking with `libbind.a' makes `getservbyname'
core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported to IBM.

For AIX 4.2.1 and `gcc', you have to make the following changes.

After configuring, edit `config.h' and `include/my_config.h' and change
the line that says this:

     #define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1

to this:

     #undef HAVE_SNPRINTF

And finally, in `mysqld.cc' you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

     #ifdef _AIX41
     extern "C" int initgroups(const char *,int);
     #endif

If you need to allocate a lot of memory to the `mysqld' process, it's
not enough to just use `ulimit -d unlimited'. You may also have to
modify `mysqld_safe' to add a line something like this:

     export LDR_CNTRL='MAXDATA=0x80000000'

You can find more about using a lot of memory at:
`http://publib16.boulder.ibm.com/pseries/en_US/aixprggd/genprogc/lrg_prg_support.htm'.


SunOS 4 Notes
.............

On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL. This in turn means
you will need GNU `make'.

Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and `libtool'.
You can use the following `configure' line to avoid this problem:

     shell> ./configure --disable-shared --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

When compiling `readline', you may get warnings about duplicate defines.
These may be ignored.

When compiling `mysqld', there will be some `implicit declaration of
function' warnings. These may be ignored.


Alpha-DEC-UNIX Notes (Tru64)
............................

If you are using `egcs' 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to
`gcc' 2.95.2, because `egcs' on DEC has some serious bugs!

When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the `-pthread' option for `cc' and `cxx' and the
`-lmach -lexc' libraries (in addition to `-lpthread').  You should run
`configure' something like this:

     CC="cc -pthread" CXX="cxx -pthread -O" \
     ./configure --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"

When compiling `mysqld', you may see a couple of warnings like this:

     mysqld.cc: In function void handle_connections()':
     mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
     accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'

You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because `configure'
can detect only errors, not warnings.

If you start the server directly from the command-line, you may have
problems with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your
outstanding processes receive a `SIGHUP' signal.)  If so, try starting
the server like this:

     shell> nohup mysqld [options] &

`nohup' causes the command following it to ignore any `SIGHUP' signal
sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
`mysqld_safe', which invokes `mysqld' using `nohup' for you.  *Note
`mysqld_safe': mysqld_safe.

If you get a problem when compiling `mysys/get_opt.c', just remove the
`#define _NO_PROTO' line from the start of that file!

If you are using Compaq's CC compiler, the following `configure' line
should work:

     CC="cc -pthread"
     CFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all -arch host"
     CXX="cxx -pthread"
     CXXFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all \
         -arch host -noexceptions -nortti"
     export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
     ./configure \
         --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
         --with-low-memory \
         --enable-large-files \
         --enable-shared=yes \
         --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"
     gnumake

If you get a problem with `libtool', when compiling with shared
libraries as above, when linking `mysql', you should be able to get
around this by issuing:

     cd mysql
     /bin/sh ../libtool --mode=link cxx -pthread  -O3 -DDBUG_OFF \
         -O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed \
         -speculate all \ -arch host  -DUNDEF_HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R \
         -o mysql  mysql.o readline.o sql_string.o completion_hash.o \
         ../readline/libreadline.a -lcurses \
         ../libmysql/.libs/libmysqlclient.so  -lm
     cd ..
     gnumake
     gnumake install
     scripts/mysql_install_db


Alpha-DEC-OSF/1 Notes
.....................

If you have problems compiling and have DEC `CC' and `gcc' installed,
try running `configure' like this:

     CC=cc CFLAGS=-O CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

If you get problems with the `c_asm.h' file, you can create and use a
'dummy' `c_asm.h' file with:

     touch include/c_asm.h
     CC=gcc CFLAGS=-I./include \
     CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

Note that the following problems with the `ld' program can be fixed by
downloading the latest DEC (Compaq) patch kit from:
`http://ftp.support.compaq.com/public/unix/'.

On OSF/1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev.
878)" the compiler had some strange behavior (undefined `asm' symbols).
`/bin/ld' also appears to be broken (problems with `_exit undefined'
errors occurring while linking `mysqld').  On this system, we have
managed to compile MySQL with the following `configure' line, after
replacing `/bin/ld' with the version from OSF 4.0C:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

With the Digital compiler "C++ V6.1-029", the following should work:

     CC=cc -pthread
     CFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all \
            -arch host
     CXX=cxx -pthread
     CXXFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed -speculate all \
               -arch host -noexceptions -nortti
     export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/mysql/mysql --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static \
                 --disable-shared --with-named-thread-libs="-lmach -lexc -lc"

In some versions of OSF/1, the `alloca()' function is broken. Fix this
by removing the line in `config.h' that defines `'HAVE_ALLOCA''.

The `alloca()' function also may have an incorrect prototype in
`/usr/include/alloca.h'.  This warning resulting from this can be
ignored.

`configure' will use the following thread libraries automatically:
`--with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"'.

When using `gcc', you can also try running `configure' like this:

     shell> CFLAGS=-D_PTHREAD_USE_D4 CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure ...

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly under high
load), you may have found an OS bug with threads and signals. In this
case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by configuring with:

     shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
            CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
            ./configure ...

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side effect
that you can't kill clients that are "sleeping" on a connection with
`mysqladmin kill' or `mysqladmin shutdown'.  Instead, the client will
die when it issues its next command.

With `gcc' 2.95.2, you will probably run into the following compile
error:

     sql_acl.cc:1456: Internal compiler error in `scan_region', at except.c:2566
     Please submit a full bug report.

To fix this you should change to the `sql' directory and do a "cut and
paste" of the last `gcc' line, but change `-O3' to `-O0' (or add `-O0'
immediately after `gcc' if you don't have any `-O' option on your
compile line).  After this is done you can just change back to the
top-level directly and run `make' again.


SGI Irix Notes
..............

If you are using Irix Version 6.5.3 or newer `mysqld' will be able to
create threads only if you run it as a user with `CAP_SCHED_MGT'
privileges (like `root') or give the `mysqld' server this privilege
with the following shell command:

     shell> chcap "CAP_SCHED_MGT+epi" /opt/mysql/libexec/mysqld

You may have to undefine some symbols in `config.h' after running
`configure' and before compiling.

In some Irix implementations, the `alloca()' function is broken.  If the
`mysqld' server dies on some `SELECT' statements, remove the lines from
`config.h' that define `HAVE_ALLOC' and `HAVE_ALLOCA_H'.  If
`mysqladmin create' doesn't work, remove the line from `config.h' that
defines `HAVE_READDIR_R'.  You may have to remove the `HAVE_TERM_H'
line as well.

SGI recommends that you install all of the patches on this page as a
set:
`http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_indigo.rps.html'

At the very minimum, you should install the latest kernel rollup, the
latest `rld' rollup, and the latest `libc' rollup.

You definitely need all the POSIX patches on this page, for pthreads
support:

`http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_posix.rps.html'

If you get the something like the following error when compiling
`mysql.cc':

     "/usr/include/curses.h", line 82: error(1084): invalid combination of type

Type the following in the top-level directory of your MySQL source tree:

     shell> extra/replace bool curses_bool < /usr/include/curses.h \
                > include/curses.h
     shell> make

There have also been reports of scheduling problems.  If only one
thread is running, performance is slow.  Avoid this by starting another
client.  This may lead to a 2-to-10-fold increase in execution speed
thereafter for the other thread.  This is a poorly understood problem
with Irix threads; you may have to improvise to find solutions until
this can be fixed.

If you are compiling with `gcc', you can use the following `configure'
command:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-thread-safe-client \
         --with-named-thread-libs=-lpthread

On Irix 6.5.11 with native Irix C and C++ compilers ver. 7.3.1.2, the
following is reported to work

     CC=cc CXX=CC CFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 -I/usr/local/include \
     -L/usr/local/lib' CXXFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 \
     -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib' \
     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-innodb --with-berkeley-db \
         --with-libwrap=/usr/local \
         --with-named-curses-libs=/usr/local/lib/libncurses.a


SCO Notes
.........

The current port is tested only on "sco3.2v5.0.5", "sco3.2v5.0.6" and
"sco3.2v5.0.7" systems.  There has also been a lot of progress on a
port to "sco 3.2v4.2".

For the moment the recommended compiler on OpenServer is `gcc' 2.95.2.
With this you should be able to compile MySQL with just:

     CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure ... (options)

  1. For OpenServer 5.0.x you need to use gcc-2.95.2p1 or newer from the
     Skunkware.  `http://www.sco.com/skunkware/' and choose browser
     OpenServer packages or by ftp to ftp2.caldera.com in the
     `pub/skunkware/osr5/devtools/gcc' directory.

  2. You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
     system.  They are required on this version of SCO Unix.  You cannot
     just use the GCC Dev system.

  3. You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.
     This can be found at
     `http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/ftp/pub/PART/pthreads.tar.gz'.
     You can also get a precompiled package from
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz'.

  4. FSU Pthreads can be compiled with SCO Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
     OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the SCO
     Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or
     OS 3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of
     problems without a good port.  The port for this product requires
     the SCO Unix Development system.  Without it, you are missing the
     libraries and the linker that is needed.

  5. To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:

       1. Run `./configure' in the `threads/src' directory and select
          the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies
          `Makefile.SCO5' to `Makefile'.

       2. Run `make'.

       3. To install in the default `/usr/include' directory, login as
          root, then `cd' to the `thread/src' directory, and run `make
          install'.

  6. Remember to use GNU `make' when making MySQL.

  7. If you don't start `mysqld_safe' as `root', you probably will get
     only the default 110 open files per process.  `mysqld' will write
     a note about this in the log file.

  8. With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or
     newer.  You should also use `gcc' 2.95.2 or newer!

     The following `configure' command should work:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared

  9. With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or
     newer.  The following `configure' command should work:

          shell> CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" \
                 ./configure \
                     --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
                     --with-named-thread-libs="-lgthreads -lsocket -lgen -lgthreads" \
                     --with-named-curses-libs="-lcurses"

     You may get some problems with some include files. In this case,
     you can find new SCO-specific include files at
     `http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/SCO-3.2v4.2-includes.tar.gz'.
     You should unpack this file in the `include' directory of your
     MySQL source tree.

SCO development notes:

   * MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link `mysqld'
     with `-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads'.

   * The SCO development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.  SCO
     claims that its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must
     be re-entrant with FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries
     to use the SCO scheme to make re-entrant libraries.

   * FSU Pthreads (at least the version at `http://www.mysql.com/')
     comes linked with GNU `malloc'.  If you encounter problems with
     memory usage, make sure that `gmalloc.o' is included in
     `libgthreads.a' and `libgthreads.so'.

   * In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware:
     `read()', `write()', `getmsg()', `connect()', `accept()',
     `select()', and `wait()'.

   * The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
     erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (version 2.0.0) breaks FSU
     threads and makes `mysqld' unstable.  You have to remove this one
     if you want to run `mysqld' on an OpenServer 5.0.6 machine.

   * SCO provides Operating Systems Patches at
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5' for OpenServer 5.0.x

   * SCO provides security fixes and `libsocket.so.2' at
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/OpenServer' and
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/sse' for OpenServer 5.0.x

   * pre-OSR506 security fixes. Also, the `telnetd' fix at
     `ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openserver/' or
     `ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openserver/CSSA-2001-SCO.10/'
     as both `libsocket.so.2' and `libresolv.so.1' with instructions for
     installing on pre-OSR506 systems.

     It's probably a good idea to install the above patches before
     trying to compile/use MySQL.


SCO UnixWare Version 7.1.x Notes
................................

On UnixWare 7.1.0, you must use a version of MySQL at least as recent as
3.22.13 to get fixes for some portability and OS problems.

We have been able to compile MySQL with the following `configure'
command on UnixWare Version 7.1.x:

     CC=cc CXX=CC ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

If you want to use `gcc', you must use `gcc' 2.95.2 or newer.

     CC=gcc CXX=g++ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

  1. SCO provides Operating Systems Patches at
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/unixware7' for UnixWare 7.1.1 and 7.1.3 and
     at `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openunix8' for OpenUNIX 8.0.0.

  2. SCO provides information about Security Fixes at
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/OpenUNIX' for OpenUNIX and at
     `ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/UnixWare' for UnixWare.


OS/2 Notes
----------

MySQL uses quite a few open files. Because of this, you should add
something like the following to your `CONFIG.SYS' file:

     SET EMXOPT=-c -n -h1024

If you don't do this, you will probably run into the following error:

     File 'xxxx' not found (Errcode: 24)

When using MySQL with OS/2 Warp 3, FixPack 29 or above is required.
With OS/2 Warp 4, FixPack 4 or above is required. This is a requirement
of the Pthreads library.  MySQL must be installed on a partition with a
type that supports long filenames, such as HPFS, FAT32, etc.

The `INSTALL.CMD' script must be run from OS/2's own `CMD.EXE' and may
not work with replacement shells such as `4OS2.EXE'.

The `scripts/mysql-install-db' script has been renamed.  It is now
called `install.cmd' and is a REXX script, which will set up the default
MySQL security settings and create the WorkPlace Shell icons for MySQL.

Dynamic module support is compiled in but not fully tested. Dynamic
modules should be compiled using the Pthreads run-time library.

     gcc -Zdll -Zmt -Zcrtdll=pthrdrtl -I../include -I../regex -I.. \
         -o example udf_example.cc -L../lib -lmysqlclient udf_example.def
     mv example.dll example.udf

*Note:* Due to limitations in OS/2, UDF module name stems must not
exceed 8 characters. Modules are stored in the `/mysql2/udf' directory;
the `safe-mysqld.cmd' script will put this directory in the
`BEGINLIBPATH' environment variable. When using UDF modules, specified
extensions are ignored--it is assumed to be `.udf'.  For example, in
Unix, the shared module might be named `example.so' and you would load
a function from it like this:

     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "example.so";

In OS/2, the module would be named `example.udf', but you would not
specify the module extension:

     mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME "example";


BeOS Notes
----------

We have in the past talked with some BeOS developers that have said that
MySQL is 80% ported to BeOS, but we haven't heard from them in a while.


Perl Installation Notes
=======================

Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the `DBI'/`DBD' client
interface. The interface requires Perl Version 5.6.0 or later.  It
*will not work* if you have an older version of Perl.

If you want to use transactions with Perl DBI, you need to have
`DBD::mysql' version 1.2216 or newer. Version 2.9003 or newer is
recommended.

As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is no longer included with MySQL
distributions. You can obtain the necessary modules from
`http://search.cpan.org' for Unix, or using the ActiveState `ppm'
program on Windows. The following sections describe how to do this.

Perl support for MySQL must be installed if you want to run the MySQL
benchmark scripts.  *Note MySQL Benchmarks::.

* Menu:

* Perl installation::           Installing Perl on Unix
* ActiveState Perl::            Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows
* Perl support problems::       Problems Using the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' Interface


Installing Perl on Unix
-----------------------

MySQL Perl support requires that you've installed MySQL client
programming support (libraries and header files).  Most installation
methods install the necesssary files. However, if you installed MySQL
from RPM files on Linux, be sure that you've installed the developer
RPM.  The client programs are in the client RPM, but client programming
support is in the developer RPM.

If you want to install Perl support, the files you will need can be
obtained from the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at
`http://search.cpan.org'.

The easiest way to install Perl modules on Unix is to use the `CPAN'
module. For example:

     shell> perl -MCPAN -e shell
     cpan> install DBI
     cpan> install DBD::mysql

The `DBD::mysql' installation runs a number of tests.  These tests
require being able to connect to the local MySQL server as the
anonymous user with no password. If you have removed anonymous accounts
or assigned them passwords, the tests fail. You can use `force install
DBD::mysql' to ignore the failed tests.

`DBI' requires the `Data::Dumper' module. It may already be installed;
if not, you should install it before installing `DBI'.

It is also possible to download the module distributions in the form of
compressed `tar' archives and build the modules manually. For example,
to unpack and build a DBI distribution, use a procedure such as this:

  1. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
          shell> gunzip < DBI-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     This command creates a directory named `DBI-VERSION'.

  2. Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:
          shell> cd DBI-VERSION

  3. Build the distribution and compile everything:
          shell> perl Makefile.PL
          shell> make
          shell> make test
          shell> make install

The `make test' command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
`DBD::mysql' installation to exercise the interface code, the MySQL
server must be running or the test will fail.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the `DBD::mysql'
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL, particularly
if you notice symptoms such as that all your `DBI' scripts fail after
you upgrade MySQL.

If you don't have access rights to install Perl modules in the system
directory or if you want to install local Perl modules, the following
reference may be useful:

     `http://servers.digitaldaze.com/extensions/perl/modules.html#modules'

Look under the heading `Installing New Modules that Require Locally
Installed Modules'.


Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows
--------------------------------------

On Windows, you should do the following to install the MySQL `DBD'
module with ActiveState Perl:

   * Get ActiveState Perl from
     `http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/' and install it.

   * Open a console window (a "DOS window").

   * If required, set the `HTTP_proxy' variable. For example, you might
     try:

          set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128

   * Start the PPM program:

          C:\> c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl

   * If you have not already done so, install `DBI':

          ppm> install DBI

   * If this succeeds, run the following command:

          install \
          ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd

The above should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

If you can't get the above to work, you should instead install the
`MyODBC' driver and connect to the MySQL server through ODBC:

     use DBI;
     $dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn",$user,$password) ||
       die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";


Problems Using the Perl `DBI'/`DBD' Interface
---------------------------------------------

If Perl reports that it can't find the `../mysql/mysql.so' module, then
the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
`libmysqlclient.so'.

You should be able to fix this by one of the following methods:

   * Compile the `DBD::mysql' distribution with `perl Makefile.PL
     -static -config' rather than `perl Makefile.PL'.

   * Copy `libmysqlclient.so' to the directory where your other shared
     libraries are located (probably `/usr/lib' or `/lib').

   * Modify the `-L' options used to compile `DBD::mysql' to reflect
     the actual location of `libmysqlclient.so'.

   * On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
     `libmysqlclient.so' is located to the `/etc/ld.so.conf' file.

   * Add the pathname of the directory where `libmysqlclient.so' is
     located to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable. Some systems use
     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' instead.

Note that you may also need to modify the `-L' options if there are
other libraries that the linker fails to find. For example, if the
linker cannot find `libc' because it is in `/lib' and the link command
specifies `-L/usr/lib', change the `-L' option to `-L/lib' or add
`-L/lib' to the existing link command.

If you get the following errors from `DBD::mysql', you are probably
using `gcc' (or using an old binary compiled with `gcc'):

     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
     /usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'

Add `-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc' to the link command when the
`mysql.so' library gets built (check the output from `make' for
`mysql.so' when you compile the Perl client).  The `-L' option should
specify the pathname of the directory where `libgcc.a' is located on
your system.

Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with `gcc'.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with `gcc'.

You may see the following error from `DBD::mysql' when you run the
tests:

     t/00base............install_driver(mysql) failed:
     Can't load '../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so' for module DBD::mysql:
     ../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so: undefined symbol:
     uncompress at /usr/lib/perl5/5.00503/i586-linux/DynaLoader.pm line 169.

This means that you need to include the `-lz' compression library on the
link line. That can be done by changing the following line in the file
`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm':

     $sysliblist .= " -lm";

Change that line to:

     $sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";

After this, you *must* run `make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

If you want to install DBI on SCO, you have to edit the `Makefile' in
DBI-xxx and each subdirectory.

Note that the following assumes `gcc' 2.95.2 or newer:

     OLD:                                  NEW:
     CC = cc                               CC = gcc
     CCCDLFLAGS = -KPIC -W1,-Bexport       CCCDLFLAGS = -fpic
     CCDLFLAGS = -wl,-Bexport              CCDLFLAGS =
     
     LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
     LDDLFLAGS = -G -L/usr/local/lib       LDDLFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
     LDFLAGS = -belf -L/usr/local/lib      LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
     
     LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
     OPTIMISE = -Od                        OPTIMISE = -O1
     
     OLD:
     CCCFLAGS = -belf -dy -w0 -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include
     
     NEW:
     CCFLAGS = -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include

This is because the Perl dynaloader will not load the `DBI' modules if
they were compiled with `icc' or `cc'.

If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of Perl
that includes `DBI' and `DBD::mysql'.  The way this works is that you
generate a version of Perl with the `DBI' code linked in and install it
on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to build a version of
Perl that additionally has the `DBD' code linked in, and install that.

On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
     or:
     shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
     /usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
     /usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
     shell> MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:\
     /usr/skunk/man:

First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked `DBI' module by
running these commands in the directory where your `DBI' distribution is
located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Then you must install the new Perl. The output of `make perl' will
indicate the exact `make' command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is `make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl
MAP_TARGET=perl'.

Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also
includes a statically linked `DBD::mysql' by running these commands in
the directory where your `DBD::mysql' distribution is located:

     shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> make perl

Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of `make
perl' indicates the command to use.
