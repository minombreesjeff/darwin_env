Before you proceed with an installation from source, first check
whether our binary is available for your platform and whether it works
for you. We put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our binaries
are built with the best possible options.

To obtain a source distribution for MySQL, *Note getting-mysql::.

MySQL source distributions are provided as compressed `tar' archives
and have names of the form `mysql-VERSION.tar.gz', where VERSION is a
number like `4.1.13'.

You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution. GNU `tar' is known
     to work.  Some operating systems come with a pre-installed version
     of `tar' that is known to have problems. For example, the `tar'
     provided with early versions of Mac OS X `tar', SunOS 4.x and
     Solaris 8 and earlier are known to have problems with long
     filenames. On Mac OS X, you can use the pre-installed `gnutar'
     program. On other systems with a deficient `tar', you should
     install GNU `tar' first.

   * A working ANSI C++ compiler. `gcc' 2.95.2 or later, `egcs' 1.0.2
     or later or `egcs 2.91.66', SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
     compilers that are known to work. `libg++' is not needed when
     using `gcc'.  `gcc' 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible to
     compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as `sql/sql_base.cc'.
     If you have only `gcc' 2.7.x, you must upgrade your `gcc' to be
     able to compile MySQL.  `gcc' 2.8.1 is also known to have problems
     on some platforms, so it should be avoided if a new compiler
     exists for the platform.

     `gcc' 2.95.2 or later is recommended when compiling MySQL 3.23.x.

   * A good `make' program. GNU `make' is always recommended and is
     sometimes required. If you have problems, we recommend GNU `make'
     3.75 or newer.

If you are using a version of `gcc' recent enough to understand the
`-fno-exceptions' option, it is _very important_ that you use this
option.  Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We
also recommend that you also use `-felide-constructors' and `-fno-rtti'
as well. When in doubt, do the following:

     CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
            -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
            --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
            --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

On most systems, this gives you a fast and stable binary.

If you run into problems and need to file a bug report, please use the
instructions in *Note bug-reports::.

2.9.1 Source Installation Overview
----------------------------------

The basic commands that you must execute to install a MySQL source
distribution are:

     shell> groupadd mysql
     shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
     shell> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
     shell> cd mysql-VERSION
     shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
     shell> make
     shell> make install
     shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
     shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
     shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
     shell> chown -R root  .
     shell> chown -R mysql var
     shell> chgrp -R mysql .
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `bin/safe_mysqld' for
`bin/mysqld_safe' in the final command.

If you start from a source RPM, do the following:

     shell> rpmbuild --rebuild --clean MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm

This makes a binary RPM that you can install. For older versions of
RPM, you may have to replace the command `rpmbuild' with `rpm' instead.

*Note*: This procedure does not set up any passwords for MySQL
accounts. After following the procedure, proceed to *Note
post-installation::, for post-installation setup and testing.

A more detailed version of the preceding description for installing
MySQL from a source distribution follows:

  1. Add a login user and group for `mysqld' to run as:

          shell> groupadd mysql
          shell> useradd -g mysql mysql

     These commands add the `mysql' group and the `mysql' user. The
     syntax for `useradd' and `groupadd' may differ slightly on
     different versions of Unix, or they may have different names such
     as `adduser' and `addgroup'.

     You might want to call the user and group something other than
     `mysql'. If so, substitute the appropriate name in the following
     steps.

  2. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution
     and change location into it.

  3. Obtain a distribution file using the instructions in *Note
     getting-mysql::.

  4. Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

          shell> gunzip < /PATH/TO/MYSQL-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -

     This command creates a directory named `mysql-VERSION'.

     With GNU `tar', no separate invocation of `gunzip' is necessary.
     You can use the following alternative command to uncompress and
     extract the distribution:

          shell> tar zxvf /PATH/TO/MYSQL-VERSION-OS.tar.gz

  5. Change location into the top-level directory of the unpacked
     distribution:

          shell> cd mysql-VERSION

     Note that currently you must configure and build MySQL from this
     top-level directory. You cannot build it in a different directory.

  6. Configure the release and compile everything:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> make

     When you run `configure', you might want to specify other options.
     Run `./configure --help' for a list of options.  *Note
     configure-options::, discusses some of the more useful options.

     If `configure' fails and you are going to send mail to a MySQL
     mailing list to ask for assistance, please include any lines from
     `config.log' that you think can help solve the problem. Also
     include the last couple of lines of output from `configure'. To
     file a bug report, please use the instructions in *Note
     bug-reports::.

     If the compile fails, see *Note compilation-problems::, for help.

  7. Install the distribution:

          shell> make install

     If you want to set up an option file, use one of those present in
     the `support-files' directory as a template. For example:

          shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf

     You might need to run these commands as `root'.

     If you want to configure support for `InnoDB' tables, you should
     edit the `/etc/my.cnf' file, removing the `#' character before the
     option lines that start with `innodb_...', and modify the option
     values to be what you want. See *Note option-files::, and *Note
     innodb-configuration::.

  8. Change location into the installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local/mysql

  9. If you have not installed MySQL before, you must create the MySQL
     grant tables:

          shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql

     If you run the command as `root', you should use the `--user'
     option as shown. The value of the option should be the name of the
     login account that you created in the first step to use for
     running the server. If you run the command while logged in as that
     user, you can omit the `--user' option.

     Note that for MySQL versions older than 3.22.10,
     `mysql_install_db' left the server running after creating the
     grant tables. This is no longer true; you need to restart the
     server after performing the remaining steps in this procedure.

 10. Change the ownership of program binaries to `root' and ownership
     of the data directory to the user that you run `mysqld' as.
     Assuming that you are in the installation directory
     (`/usr/local/mysql'), the commands look like this:

          shell> chown -R root  .
          shell> chown -R mysql var
          shell> chgrp -R mysql .

     The first command changes the owner attribute of the files to the
     `root' user. The second changes the owner attribute of the data
     directory to the `mysql' user. The third changes the group
     attribute to the `mysql' group.

 11. If you want MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
     machine, you can copy `support-files/mysql.server' to the location
     where your system has its startup files. More information can be
     found in the script itself, and in *Note automatic-start::.

 12. You can set up new accounts using the `bin/mysql_setpermission'
     script if you install the `DBI' and `DBD::mysql' Perl modules. For
     instructions, see *Note perl-support::.

After everything has been installed, you should test your distribution.
To start the MySQL server, use the following command:

     shell> /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute `safe_mysqld' for
`mysqld_safe' in the command.

If that command fails immediately and prints `mysqld ended', you can
find some information in the `HOST_NAME.err' file in the data directory.

More information about `mysqld_safe' is given in *Note mysqld-safe::.

*Note*: The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables
initially have no passwords.  After starting the server, you should set
up passwords for them using the instructions in *Note
post-installation::.

2.9.2 Typical `configure' Options
---------------------------------

The `configure' script gives you a great deal of control over how you
configure a MySQL source distribution.  Typically you do this using
options on the `configure' command line. You can also affect
`configure' using certain environment variables. See *Note
environment-variables::. For a list of options supported by
`configure', run this command:

     shell> ./configure --help

Some of the more commonly used `configure' options are described here:

   * To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
     not the server, use the `--without-server' option:

          shell> ./configure --without-server

     If you have no C++ compiler, some client programs such as `mysql'
     cannot be compiled because they require C++.. In this case, you
     can remove the code in `configure' that tests for the C++ compiler
     and then run `./configure' with the `--without-server' option. The
     compile step should still try to build all clients, but you can
     ignore any warnings about files such as `mysql.cc'. (If `make'
     stops, try `make -k' to tell it to continue with the rest of the
     build even if errors occur.)

   * If you want to build the embedded MySQL library (`libmysqld.a'),
     use the `--with-embedded-server' option.

   * If you do not want your log files and database directories located
     under `/usr/local/var', use a `configure' command something like
     one of these:

          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
          shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                     --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data

     The first command changes the installation prefix so that
     everything is installed under `/usr/local/mysql' rather than the
     default of `/usr/local'. The second command preserves the default
     installation prefix, but overrides the default location for
     database directories (normally `/usr/local/var') and changes it to
     `/usr/local/mysql/data'.

     You can also specify the installation directory and data directory
     locations at server startup time by using the `--basedir' and
     `--datadir' options. These can be given on the command line or in
     an MySQL option file, although it is more common to use an option
     file. See *Note option-files::.

   * If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket file location
     to be somewhere other than the default location (normally in the
     directory `/tmp' or `/var/run'), use a `configure' command like
     this:

          shell> ./configure \
                     --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock

     The socket filename must be an absolute pathname. You can also
     change the location of `mysql.sock' at server startup by using a
     MySQL option file. See *Note problems-with-mysql-sock::.

   * If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to
     make a binary distribution, to get better performance, or to work
     around problems with some Red Hat Linux distributions), run
     `configure' like this:

          shell> ./configure --with-client-ldflags=-all-static \
                     --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

   * If you are using `gcc' and do not have `libg++' or `libstdc++'
     installed, you can tell `configure' to use `gcc' as your C++
     compiler:

          shell> CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure

     When you use `gcc' as your C++ compiler, it does not attempt to
     link in `libg++' or `libstdc++'. This may be a good thing to do
     even if you have those libraries installed. Some versions of them
     have caused strange problems for MySQL users in the past.

     The following list indicates some compilers and environment
     variable settings that are commonly used with each one.

        * `gcc' 2.7.2:

               CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors"

        * `egcs' 1.0.3a:

               CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
               -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"

        * `gcc' 2.95.2:

               CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
               -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"

        * `pgcc' 2.90.29 or newer:

               CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double" CXX=gcc \
               CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double \
               -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"

     In most cases, you can get a reasonably optimized MySQL binary by
     using the options from the preceding list and adding the following
     options to the `configure' line:

          --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
          --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The full `configure' line would, in other words, be something like
     the following for all recent `gcc' versions:

          CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
          -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
          --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
          --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

     The binaries we provide on the MySQL Web site at
     `http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/' are all compiled with full
     optimization and should be perfect for most users. See *Note
     mysql-binaries::. There are some configuration settings you can
     tweak to build an even faster binary, but these are only for
     advanced users. See *Note compile-and-link-options::.

     If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or
     linker not being able to create the shared library
     `libmysqlclient.so.N' (where N is a version number), you can work
     around this problem by giving the `--disable-shared' option to
     `configure'. In this case, `configure' does not build a shared
     `libmysqlclient.so.N' library.

   * By default, MySQL uses the `latin1' (cp1252 West European)
     character set. To change the default set, use the `--with-charset'
     option:

          shell> ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET

     CHARSET may be one of `big5', `cp1251', `cp1257', `czech',
     `danish', `dec8', `dos', `euc_kr', `gb2312', `gbk', `german1',
     `hebrew', `hp8', `hungarian', `koi8_ru', `koi8_ukr', `latin1',
     `latin2', `sjis', `swe7', `tis620', `ujis', `usa7', or
     `win1251ukr'.  See *Note character-sets::. (Additional character
     sets might be available. Check the output from `./configure
     --help' for the current list.)

     As of MySQL 4.1.1, the default collation may also be specified.
     MySQL uses the `latin1_swedish_ci' collation. To change this, use
     the `--with-collation' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-collation=COLLATION

     To change both the character set and the collation, use both the
     `--with-charset' and `--with-collation' options. The collation
     must be a legal collation for the character set. (Use the `SHOW
     COLLATION' statement to determine which collations are available
     for each character set.)

     *Warning:* If you change character sets after having created any
     tables, you have to run `myisamchk -r -q
     --set-collation=COLLATION_NAME' on every `MyISAM' table. Your
     indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise. This can happen if you
     install MySQL, create some tables, and then reconfigure MySQL to
     use a different character set and reinstall it.  (Use
     `--set-character-set' before MySQL 4.1.1.)

     With the `configure' option `--with-extra-charsets=LIST', you can
     define which additional character sets should be compiled into the
     server. LIST is one of the following:

        * A list of character set names separated by spaces

        * `complex' to include all character sets that can't be
          dynamically loaded

        * `all' to include all character sets into the binaries

     Clients that want to convert characters between the server and the
     client should use the `SET NAMES' statement. See *Note
     set-option::, and *Note charset-connection::.

   * To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the `--with-debug'
     option:

          shell> ./configure --with-debug

     This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find
     some errors and that provides output about what is happening. See
     *Note debugging-server::.

   * If your client programs are using threads, you must compile a
     thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
     `--enable-thread-safe-client' configure option. This creates a
     `libmysqlclient_r' library with which you should link your threaded
     applications. See *Note threaded-clients::.

   * It is now possible to build MySQL with big table support using the
     `--with-big-tables' option, beginning with the following MySQL
     versions:

        * *4.0 series*: 4.0.25

        * *4.1 series*: 4.1.11

     This option causes the variables that store table row counts to be
     declared as `unsigned long long' rather than `unsigned long'. This
     enables tables to hold up to approximately 1.844E+19 ((2^32)^2)
     rows rather than 2^32 (~4.295E+09) rows. Previously it was
     necessary to pass `-DBIG_TABLES' to the compiler manually in order
     to enable this feature.

   * See *Note operating-system-specific-notes::, for options that
     pertain to particular operating systems.

   * See *Note secure-using-ssl::, for options that pertain to
     configuring MySQL to support secure (encrypted) connections.

2.9.3 Installing from the Development Source Tree
-------------------------------------------------

*Caution*: You should read this section only if you are interested in
helping us test new code.  If you just want to get MySQL up and running
on your system, you should use a standard release distribution (either
a binary or source distribution).

To obtain our most recent development source tree, first download and
install the BitKeeper free client if you do not have it. The client can
be obtained from `http://www.bitmover.com/bk-client.shar'.

To install the BitKeeper client on Unix, use these commands:

     shell> sh bk-client.shar
     shell> cd bk_client-1.1
     shell> make all
     shell> PATH=$PWD:$PATH

To install the BitKeeper client on Windows, use these instructions:

  1. Download and install Cygwin from http://cygwin.com
     (http://cygwin.com/).

  2. Make sure `gcc' and `make' have been installed under Cygwin. You
     can test this by issuing `which gcc' and `which make' commands. If
     either one is not installed, run Cygwin's package manager, select
     `gcc', `make', or both, and install them.

  3. Under Cygwin, execute these commands:

          shell> sh bk-client.shar
          shell> cd bk_client-1.1

     Then edit the `Makefile' and change the line that reads `$(CC)
     $(CFLAGS) -o sfio -lz sfio.c' to this:

          $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o sfio sfio.c -lz

     Now run the `make' command and set the path:

          shell> make all
          shell> PATH=$PWD:$PATH

The BitKeeper free client is shipped with its source code. The only
documentation available for the free client is the source code itself.

After you have installed the BitKeeper client, you can access the MySQL
development source tree:

  1. Change location to the directory you want to work from, and then
     use one of the following commands to make a local copy of the
     MySQL version branch of your choice:

     To copy the 3.23 branch, use this command:

          shell> sfioball -r+ bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-3.23 mysql-3.23

     To copy the 4.0 branch, use this command:

          shell> sfioball -r+ bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.0 mysql-4.0

     To copy the 4.1 branch, use this command:

          shell> sfioball -r+ bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1

     In the preceding examples, the source tree is set up in the
     `mysql-3.23/', `mysql-4.0/', or `mysql-4.1/' subdirectory of your
     current directory.

     The initial download of the source tree may take a while,
     depending on the speed of your connection. Please be patient.

  2. You need GNU `make', `autoconf' 2.58 (or newer), `automake' 1.8,
     `libtool' 1.5, and `m4' to run the next set of commands. Even
     though many operating systems come with their own implementation
     of `make', chances are high that the compilation fails with
     strange error messages.  Therefore, it is highly recommended that
     you use GNU `make' (sometimes named `gmake') instead.

     Fortunately, a large number of operating systems ship with the GNU
     toolchain preinstalled or supply installable packages of these.
     They can also be downloaded from the following locations:

        * `http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'

        * `http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/'

        * `http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/'

        * `http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/'

        * `http://www.gnu.org/software/make/'

     If you are trying to configure MySQL 4.1, you also need GNU
     `bison' 1.75 or later. Older versions of `bison' may report this
     error:

          sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767) exceeded

     Note: The maximum table size is not actually exceeded; the error
     is caused by bugs in older versions of `bison'.

     Versions of MySQL before version 4.1 may also compile with other
     `yacc' implementations (for example, BSD `yacc' 91.7.30). For
     later versions, GNU `bison' is required.

     The following example shows the typical commands required to
     configure a source tree. The first `cd' command changes location
     into the top-level directory of the tree; replace `mysql-5.0' with
     the appropriate directory name.

          shell> cd mysql-5.0
          shell> (cd bdb/dist; sh s_all)
          shell> (cd innobase; autoreconf --force --install)
          shell> autoreconf --force --install
          shell> ./configure  # Add your favorite options here
          shell> make

     Or you can use `BUILD/autorun.sh' as a shortcut for the following
     sequence of commands:

          shell> aclocal; autoheader
          shell> libtoolize --automake --force
          shell> automake --force --add-missing; autoconf
          shell> (cd innobase; aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake)
          shell> (cd bdb/dist; sh s_all)

     The command lines that change directory into the `innobase' and
     `bdb/dist' directories are used to configure the `InnoDB' and
     Berkeley DB (`BDB') storage engines. You can omit these command
     lines if you to not require `InnoDB' or `BDB' support.

     If you get some strange errors during this stage, verify that you
     really have `libtool' installed.

     A collection of our standard configuration scripts is located in
     the `BUILD' subdirectory. You may find it more convenient to use
     the `BUILD/compile-pentium-debug' script than the preceding set of
     shell commands. To compile on a different architecture, modify the
     script by removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

  3. When the build is done, run `make install'.  Be careful with this
     on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live
     release installation. If you have another installation of MySQL,
     we recommend that you run `./configure' with different values for
     the `--prefix', `--with-tcp-port', and `--unix-socket-path'
     options than those used for your production server.

  4. Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new
     features crash. Start by running `make test'. See *Note
     mysql-test-suite::.

  5. If you have gotten to the `make' stage, but the distribution does
     not compile, please enter the problem into our bugs database using
     the instructions given in *Note bug-reports::. If you have
     installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and they
     crash trying to process our configuration files, please report
     that also. However, if you execute `aclocal' and get a `command not
     found' error or a similar problem, do not report it. Instead, make
     sure that all the necessary tools are installed and that your
     `PATH' variable is set correctly so that your shell can find them.

  6. After initially copying the repository with `sfioball' to obtain
     the source tree, you should use `update' periodically to update
     your local copy. To do this any time after you have set up the
     repository, use this command: (the example is for updating the 4.1
     branch):

          shell> update bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1

  7. You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs
     by viewing the `BK/ChangeLog' file in the source tree and looking
     at the `ChangeSet' descriptions listed there. To examine a
     particular changeset, you would have to use the `sfioball' command
     to extract two particular revisions of the source tree, and then
     use an external `diff' command to compare them. If you see diffs
     or code that you have a question about, do not hesitate to send
     email to the MySQL `internals' mailing list. See *Note
     mailing-lists::. If you think you have a better idea on how to do
     something, send an email message to the same address with a patch.

You can also browse changesets, comments, and source code online. For
example, to browse this information for MySQL 4.1, go to
`http://mysql.bkbits.net:8080/mysql-4.1'.

2.9.4 Dealing with Problems Compiling MySQL
-------------------------------------------

All MySQL programs compile cleanly for us with no warnings on Solaris
or Linux using `gcc'. On other systems, warnings may occur due to
differences in system include files.  See *Note mit-pthreads::, for
warnings that may occur when using MIT-pthreads. For other problems,
check the following list.

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring. If you do need to
reconfigure, take note of the following:

   * If `configure' is run after it has previously been run, it may use
     information that was gathered during its previous invocation. This
     information is stored in `config.cache'. When `configure' starts
     up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on
     the assumption that the information is still correct. That
     assumption is invalid when you reconfigure.

   * Each time you run `configure', you must run `make' again to
     recompile. However, you may want to remove old object files from
     previous builds first because they were compiled using different
     configuration options.

To prevent old configuration information or object files from being
used, run these commands before re-running `configure':

     shell> rm config.cache
     shell> make clean

Alternatively, you can run `make distclean'.

The following list describes some of the problems when compiling MySQL
that have been found to occur most often:

   * If you get errors such as the ones shown here when compiling
     `sql_yacc.cc', you probably have run out of memory or swap space:

          Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
          Out of virtual memory
          Virtual memory exhausted

     The problem is that `gcc' requires a huge amount of memory to
     compile `sql_yacc.cc' with inline functions. Try running
     `configure' with the `--with-low-memory' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-low-memory

     This option causes `-fno-inline' to be added to the compile line
     if you are using `gcc' and `-O0' if you are using something else.
     You should try the `--with-low-memory' option even if you have so
     much memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have
     run out. This problem has been observed to occur even on systems
     with generous hardware configurations, and the `--with-low-memory'
     option usually fixes it.

   * By default, `configure' picks `c++' as the compiler name and GNU
     `c++' links with `-lg++'. If you are using `gcc', that behavior can
     cause problems during configuration such as this:

          configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
          C++ compiler cannot create executables.

     You might also observe problems during compilation related to
     `g++', `libg++', or `libstdc++'.

     One cause of these problems is that you may not have `g++', or you
     may have `g++' but not `libg++', or `libstdc++'. Take a look at the
     `config.log' file. It should contain the exact reason why your C++
     compiler did not work. To work around these problems, you can use
     `gcc' as your C++ compiler. Try setting the environment variable
     `CXX' to `"gcc -O3"'. For example:

          shell> CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure

     This works because `gcc' compiles C++ source files as well as
     `g++' does, but does not link in `libg++' or `libstdc++' by
     default.

     Another way to fix these problems is to install `g++', `libg++',
     and `libstdc++'. However, we recommend that you not use `libg++' or
     `libstdc++' with MySQL because this only increases the binary size
     of `mysqld' without providing any benefits. Some versions of these
     libraries have also caused strange problems for MySQL users in the
     past.

     Using `gcc' as the C++ compiler is also required if you want to
     compile MySQL with RAID functionality (see *Note create-table::,
     for more info on RAID table type) and you are using GNU `gcc'
     version 3 and above. If you get errors like those following during
     the linking stage when you configure MySQL to compile with the
     option `--with-raid', try to use `gcc' as your C++ compiler by
     defining the `CXX' environment variable:

          gcc -O3 -DDBUG_OFF -rdynamic -o isamchk isamchk.o sort.o  libnisam.a
          ../mysys/libmysys.a ../dbug/libdbug.a ../strings/libmystrings.a
           -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x79): In function
          `my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0xdd): In function
          `my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x129): In function
          `my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x189): In function
          `my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          ../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x64b): In function
          `my_raid_close':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
          collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

   * If your compilation fails with errors such as any of the
     following, you must upgrade your version of `make' to GNU `make':

          making all in mit-pthreads
          make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
          Badly formed macro assignment

     Or:

          make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:

     Or:

          pthread.h: No such file or directory

     Solaris and FreeBSD are known to have troublesome `make' programs.

     GNU `make' 3.75 is known to work.

   * If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers,
     do so by adding the flags to the `CFLAGS' and `CXXFLAGS'
     environment variables. You can also specify the compiler names
     this way using `CC' and `CXX'. For example:

          shell> CC=gcc
          shell> CFLAGS=-O3
          shell> CXX=gcc
          shell> CXXFLAGS=-O3
          shell> export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS

     See *Note mysql-binaries::, for a list of flag definitions that
     have been found to be useful on various systems.

   * If you get errors such as those shown here when compiling
     `mysqld', `configure' did not correctly detect the type of the
     last argument to `accept()', `getsockname()', or `getpeername()':

          cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
               type of the pointer value ''length'' is ''unsigned long'',
               which is not compatible with ''int''.
          new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&cAddr, &length);

     To fix this, edit the `config.h' file (which is generated by
     `configure'). Look for these lines:

          /* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
          #define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX

     Change `XXX' to `size_t' or `int', depending on your operating
     system. (You must do this each time you run `configure' because
     `configure' regenerates `config.h'.)

   * The `sql_yacc.cc' file is generated from `sql_yacc.yy'. Normally,
     the build process does not need to create `sql_yacc.cc' because
     MySQL comes with a pre-generated copy. However, if you do need to
     re-create it, you might encounter this error:

          "sql_yacc.yy", line XXX fatal: default action causes potential...

     This is a sign that your version of `yacc' is deficient. You
     probably need to install `bison' (the GNU version of `yacc') and
     use that instead.

   * On Debian Linux 3.0, you need to install `gawk' instead of the
     default `mawk' if you want to compile MySQL 4.1 or higher with
     Berkeley DB support.

   * If you need to debug `mysqld' or a MySQL client, run `configure'
     with the `--with-debug' option, and then recompile and link your
     clients with the new client library. See *Note debugging-client::.

   * If you get a compilation error on Linux (for example, SuSE Linux
     8.1 or Red Hat Linux 7.3) similar to the following one, you
     probably do not have `g++' installed:

          libmysql.c:1329: warning: passing arg 5 of `gethostbyname_r' from
          incompatible pointer type
          libmysql.c:1329: too few arguments to function `gethostbyname_r'
          libmysql.c:1329: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer
          without a cast
          make[2]: *** [libmysql.lo] Error 1

     By default, the `configure' script attempts to determine the
     correct number of arguments by using `g++' (the GNU C++ compiler).
     This test yields incorrect results if `g++' is not installed.
     There are two ways to work around this problem:

        * Make sure that the GNU C++ `g++' is installed. On some Linux
          distributions, the required package is called `gpp'; on
          others, it is named `gcc-c++'.

        * Use `gcc' as your C++ compiler by setting the `CXX'
          environment variable to `gcc':

               export CXX="gcc"

     You must run `configure' again after making either of those
     changes.

2.9.5 MIT-pthreads Notes
------------------------

This section describes some of the issues involved in using
MIT-pthreads.

On Linux, you should _not_ use MIT-pthreads.  Use the installed
LinuxThreads implementation instead. See *Note linux::.

If your system does not provide native thread support, you should build
MySQL using the MIT-pthreads package. This includes older FreeBSD
systems, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.4 and earlier, and some others. See *Note
which-os::.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.2, MIT-pthreads is no longer part of the
source distribution. If you require this package, you need to download
it separately from
`http://dev.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/pthreads-1_60_beta6-mysql.tar.gz'

After downloading, extract this source archive into the top level of
the MySQL source directory. It creates a new subdirectory named
`mit-pthreads'.

   * On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
     `configure' with the `--with-mit-threads' option:

          shell> ./configure --with-mit-threads

     Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
     MIT-pthreads because we want to minimize our changes to this code.

   * The checks that determine whether to use MIT-pthreads occur only
     during the part of the configuration process that deals with the
     server code. If you have configured the distribution using
     `--without-server' to build only the client code, clients do not
     know whether MIT-pthreads is being used and use Unix socket file
     connections by default. Because Unix socket files do not work
     under MIT-pthreads on some platforms, this means you need to use
     `-h' or `--host' with a value other than `localhost' when you run
     client programs.

   * When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
     disabled by default for performance reasons. You can tell the
     server to use system locking with the `--external-locking' option.
     This is needed only if you want to be able to run two MySQL
     servers against the same data files, but that is not recommended,
     anyway.

   * Sometimes the pthread `bind()' command fails to bind to a socket
     without any error message (at least on Solaris). The result is
     that all connections to the server fail. For example:

          shell> mysqladmin version
          mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
          error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'

     The solution to this problem is to kill the `mysqld' server and
     restart it. This has happened to us only when we forced the server
     to shut down and then restarted it immediately.

   * With MIT-pthreads, the `sleep()' system call isn't interruptible
     with `SIGINT' (break). This is noticeable only when you run
     `mysqladmin --sleep'. You must wait for the `sleep()' call to
     terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

   * When linking, you might receive warning messages like these (at
     least on Solaris); they can be ignored:

          ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
          ld: warning: symbol `__iob' has differing sizes:
              (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
          file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
              /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken

   * Some other warnings also can be ignored:

          implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
          implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'

   * We have not gotten `readline' to work with MIT-pthreads. (This is
     not needed, but may be interesting for someone.)
