* v0.71, 19 February 2005

   Fix some more memory leaks, in the ported GUSI routines.  Well, technically,
   the memory leaks are still there: the return values of GUSIFSp2FullPath,
   GUSIFS2FullPath, and GUSIFSp2Encoding need to be freed, and some frontend
   functions were added to return SVs instead, freeing the values as
   necessary.


* v0.70, 10 May 2004

   Fix some major memory leaks in Mac::AppleEvents.  Due to a necessary change
   for Mac OS X, caller of AEDesc->data method is now responsible for disposing of
   the returned Handle object with Handle->dispose.

   Improve Mac::Notification tests.

   Clean up docs; add notes about gcc versions.


* v0.66, 23 March 2004

   Fix _Unix2Mac to be more robust, by making it more limited: it must point
   to a file (existing or not) in an existing directory.  This limitation is
   not unusual, and it is extremely rare that you would want to pass a path
   to a file in a directory that did not already exist.

* v0.65, 9 March 2004

   DirectoryCopy.c and FileCopy.c in MoreFiles have issues with G5 optimization
   flags; ignore those flags for compiling MoreFiles. (John Siracusa)

   Clean up tests, including turning GUI tests off by default (add
   MAC_CARBON_GUI=1 to `make test` to turn on) and ability to turn
   off sound (add MAC_CARBON_SOUND=0 to turn off).  Affected tests
   include MacPerl, Notification, Sound, and Speech.


* v0.64, 18 February 2004

   *Export* typeApplicationBundleID target type constant.

   Remove Mac::Path::Util dependence and add _Unix2Mac to Mac::Files instead.

* v0.63, 19 November 2003

   Add typeApplicationBundleID target type constant.


* v0.62, 31 October 2003

   Fix incorrect constant for typeApplicationURL.


* v0.61, 28 October 2003

   Adjust Mac::Speech test to work with fresh install of Panther, where
   (on my machine) the Good News voice won't load, so CountVoices()
   returns less than the test thinks it should.  Only this one test has
   been changed, no need to upgrade from 0.60.


* v0.60, 27 October 2003

   Updated a bunch of docs for Carbon compatibility

   Cleaned up docs a bit

   Reverted AESend to use AESend without an idle proc,
   instead of AESendMessage with a mach port

* v0.54, 13 August 2003

   Skip some tests that fail on UFS (Randal Schwartz)

   undef DEBUG for the sake of gcc 3.3 (perl's DEBUG conflicts with Mac's)

* v0.53, 24 June 2003

   OSADoEvent fixed

   Fix some Files tests

   Add Mac::Path::Util 0.09 to prereqs for Mac OS X


* v0.52, 22 May 2003

   Make Mac::AppleEvents return actual value, not pretty-printed value,
   as last resort (if you want a pretty-printed value, get it yourself
   with AEPrint, but we'll assume you want to do something useful with
   the data)

   Fix some memory leaks, sizes, and return values in Mac::Resources
   stuff from 0.50

   Overload NewAliasMinimalFromFullPath for Mac OS X, first converting
   the path to an HFS path (that is all that NewAliasMinimalFromFullPath
   knows)

   Add app creator type/signature to Processes/eg/Processes.plx output


* v0.51, 7 April 2003

   Add lots of tests for Mac::Files

   Fix the two-arg form of FSpGetCatInfo(FILE, INDEX)

     - auto-generate $module.pod (and manpages) from POD in $module.pm
       and $module.xs
