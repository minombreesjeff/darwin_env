	* VERSION 5.416 RELEASED

	* Allow MIME::Tools to work with MIME::QuotedPrint 2.20 again.
	The Makefile.PL will warn about potential problems, but will allow you
	to proceed.

	* Field/ParamVal.pm: Strip trailing whitespace when extracting
	parameters.  Apparently, not doing so can cause Perl to core dump
	on certain badly-formed messages.

	* Remove MIME::QuotedPrint 3.03 as a dependency and add

	and die if they fail.  Problem reported by Mark Martinec.
